            "content": "The two classes are a normal heartbeat(class 0) and a Myocardial Infarction(class 1). The electrocardiogram of a normal heartbeat and that of a myocardial infarction are quite different, mainly reflected in the following core features:\n Normal heartbeat: The ST segment is straight and coincides with the baseline. T waves are usually upright and symmetrical.\nMyocardial infarction: The ST segment will show obvious abnormalities. The most common two situations are: one is the arched back upward type elevation, and the other is significant depression. The T wave becomes abnormally sharp (acute phase) or symmetrically inverted (necrotic phase). You will be provided with two time series samples from each category of this dataset. Your first task is to analyze and compare the significant pattern differences across these categories.\n### Dataset Details:\n- **Categories**: 2\n- **Sequence Length**: 96 time points\n### Time Series Samples (2 Samples per Category):\n**Category 0**: \n- **Sample 1**: [2.0394, 1.8832, 1.9093, 2.4715, 1.1181, 0.0444, 0.0238, -0.1855, -0.8412, -1.2108, -1.165, -1.3306, -1.4505, -1.6214, -1.5286, -1.6565, -1.8499, -1.4444, -1.8181, -1.7575, -1.55, -2.0486, -2.0674, -1.7514, -1.8899, -1.9402, -1.3924, -1.2765, -0.9696, -0.8135, -0.5341, 0.1865, 0.1889, 0.5279, 1.0166, 0.987, 1.0381, 0.9051, 0.7732, 1.1705, 0.5291, 0.6571, 0.6781, 0.5179, 0.5417, 0.4709, 0.4679, 0.5991, 0.4739, 0.5029, 0.6598, 0.3841, 0.6822, 0.756, 0.6144, 0.9853, 1.0581, 0.8516, 0.5387, 0.9025, 0.9881, 0.6547, 0.5838, 0.2203, 0.1677, -0.0078, 0.0474, -0.1318, -0.0608, 0.0772, -0.2907, -0.0965, -0.1756, -0.1768, -0.2615, -0.3017, -0.1577, -0.1611, -0.2752, -0.3762, -0.1073, -0.0647, -0.2052, -0.0877, -0.0864, -0.0888, 0.0905, 0.0581, 0.0004, 0.2684, 0.56, 0.5275, 0.51, 0.677, 1.2486, 1.3726]\n- **Sample 2**: [1.205, 2.0319, 2.4473, 2.7394, 2.7459, 2.2764, 1.5254, 0.7606, 0.1884, -0.0291, -0.0495, -0.21, -0.3742, -0.2486, -0.095, -0.0995, -0.1214, -0.3585, -0.7391, -0.7877, -0.7089, -0.7598, -0.7411, -0.8817, -1.0189, -0.5814, -0.359, -0.9242, -1.0948, -0.6614, -0.7851, -1.2882, -1.3345, -1.2678, -1.5021, -1.64, -1.534, -1.5669, -1.731, -1.7197, -1.6685, -1.7355, -1.6473, -1.3876, -1.3096, -1.3197, -1.1004, -0.9005, -0.9343, -0.7652, -0.3175, -0.1271, -0.1239, 0.0944, 0.2884, 0.2613, 0.2897, 0.4073, 0.4366, 0.4493, 0.5709, 0.7112, 0.6727, 0.501, 0.5047, 0.6441, 0.5693, 0.4064, 0.4502, 0.5175, 0.5028, 0.5719, 0.6347, 0.6493, 0.7031, 0.5877, 0.3552, 0.391, 0.5588, 0.611, 0.6926, 0.7944, 0.8969, 1.0515, 0.9391, 0.5557, 0.4473, 0.5646, 0.4876, 0.421, 0.5498, 0.5055, 0.2818, 0.3468, 0.5264, 0.2279]\n -

            "content": "Summary answer (short):\nThere are consistent, interpretable differences between the two classes in these examples. The biggest differences occur in the early\u2192middle portion of the traces where ST-level shifts and T-wave morphology would be expected. Category 1 (Myocardial Infarction) traces show larger early peaks and more pronounced, longer-lasting ST deviations (deeper troughs or abrupt changes) and less smooth, sometimes inverted/sharper T-wave\u2013like shapes. Category 0 (Normal) traces are overall smoother, return to a modest positive plateau in the middle (upright T-wave region), and show more symmetric, less abrupt T-wave shapes.\n\nDetailed comparison by segments (sequence length = 96; I use early = indices 0\u201331, middle = 32\u201363, late = 64\u201395):\n\n1) Early (indices 0\u201331) \u2014 QRS / immediate post\u2011QRS behavior\n- Category 0 (normal):\n  - Initial peaks typically ~1\u20132.7 and then a relatively smooth descent into negative values around \u22121 to \u22122 (examples: samples 1\u20133 peak ~2.0; sample 2 peaks ~2.7).\n  - Transitions are gradual in many cases.\n- Category 1 (MI):\n  - Often have larger initial positive excursions (sample 2 reaches 3.44) or abrupt swings (e.g., sample 1 and 3 show rapid changes from positive to negative).\n  - More abrupt fall from the early peak into negative territory in several examples.\n- Interpretation: MI examples show larger and/or sharper early deflections and quicker transitions into abnormal ST levels compared with normals.\n\n2) Middle (indices 32\u201363) \u2014 the ST segment region (important clinically)\n- Category 0 (normal):\n  - After the early dip the series commonly recovers to a relatively steady small positive plateau (roughly 0.4\u20131.0) across many time points \u2014 consistent with an upright, symmetric T-wave / ST near baseline.\n  - Variation is moderate and smooth.\n- Category 1 (MI):\n  - Shows more pronounced and prolonged negative deflections (ST depression) or deeper troughs around \u22121.5 to \u22122.1 in several samples before recovery.\n  - Where recovery occurs, it is often more irregular and the T\u2011wave\u2013like peaks can be sharper or asymmetrical.\n- Interpretation: This is the clearest separation \u2014 Category 1 often displays sustained ST deviations (depression or abrupt abnormality) in the middle segment, while Category 0 tends to have ST near baseline and a smooth positive T-wave region.\n\n3) Late (indices 64\u201395) \u2014 T wave recovery / later repolarization\n- Category 0 (normal):\n  - Late portion commonly shows small oscillations around zero with a return to modest positive values toward the very end in several examples (final rise seen in samples).\n  - T waves appear relatively symmetric and not extremely sharp.\n- Category 1 (MI):\n  - Late behavior is more variable: some examples show continued irregularity, smaller or sometimes inverted T-wave shapes, and occasional secondary peaks. Magnitude is generally less extreme than the early/middle deviations but less regular than Category 0.\n- Interpretation: late differences are present but less consistent than early/middle; MI traces tend to remain more irregular.\n\nNumeric/qualitative highlights\n- Maximum early positive amplitude: Category 1 up to \u22483.44 (sample 2), Category 0 generally \u2264\u22482.75.\n- Deep negative troughs (middle): both classes reach \u2248\u22122 in a few traces, but Category 1 shows these troughs more abruptly and often sustained over consecutive points (longer ST deviation).\n- T-wave morphology: Category 0 shows smoother, more symmetric positive T\u2011wave like plateau in the middle; Category 1 shows sharper peaks or late inversions (consistent with \u201cacute\u201d sharp or \u201cnecrotic\u201d inverted T-wave descriptions).\n\nCaveats\n- Only three examples per class are available here; conclusions are descriptive and consistent with classical MI ECG features (ST deviation and abnormal T waves) but should be confirmed on a larger sample set.\n- This is single-lead, downsampled/abstracted time series behavior; mapping to exact ECG segments (QRS/ST/T) is approximate.\n\nBottom line:\nYes \u2014 meaningful differences are present. Category 1 (MI) shows larger early peaks, more abrupt changes and more pronounced/prolonged ST deviations and abnormal (sharper or inverted) T\u2011wave shapes, especially evident in the middle portion of the 96\u2011point trace. Category 0 (normal) traces are smoother, have ST closer to baseline and show upright, more symmetric T\u2011wave\u2013like plateaus."

This pattern contains large, sudden ST\u2011level deviations and prolonged elevated segments rather than the smooth, symmetric T\u2011wave\u2013like positive plateau around baseline seen in the Category 0 (normal) examples. In my prior comparison Category 1 (MI) series tended to show larger early/segmental peaks, abrupt transitions and pronounced, sustained ST abnormalities or sharp/inverted T\u2011wave morphology. The new sample\u2019s repeated, non\u2011smooth, high amplitude elevations interleaved with a depressed baseline match those MI characteristics. Caveat: the training set is tiny and the series here is highly quantized/stepwise, so I assign moderate (not maximal) confidence."

The electrocardiogram of a normal heartbeat and that of a myocardial infarction are quite different, mainly reflected in the following core features:\n Normal heartbeat: The ST segment is straight and coincides with the baseline. T waves are usually upright and symmetrical.\nMyocardial infarction: The ST segment will show obvious abnormalities. The most common two situations are: one is the arched back upward type elevation, and the other is significant depression. The T wave becomes abnormally sharp (acute phase) or symmetrically inverted (necrotic phase). You will be provided with two time series samples from each category of this dataset.

            "content": "Short answer: both classes share the same overall three\u2011phase ECG-like pattern (an early positive R/peak, a pronounced negative ST/QS plateau, then a later recovery/T\u2011wave plateau), but the myocardial-infarction (category 1) series tend to show more pronounced ST abnormalities (either more extreme/longer depressions or occasional stronger early elevation), faster transitions (sharper slopes) and less smooth / more asymmetric T\u2011wave behavior. There is substantial overlap in amplitudes, so the main discriminative cues are the sign, amplitude and duration of the ST deviation and the sharpness/asymmetry of the T region rather than a simple single amplitude threshold.\n\nSegmented description (indices 0\u201324 early, 25\u201359 middle, 60\u201395 late)\n\n- Early (indices 0\u201324)\n  - Common pattern (both classes): a clear early positive hump/peak (R\u2011like) in the first ~5\u201310 points, followed by a rapid fall toward negative values.\n  - Category 0 (normal): early peaks typically in the \u22481.9\u20132.7 range (examples: 2.4715, 2.7459, 2.3344) then a relatively rapid decline to the negative ST region.\n  - Category 1 (MI): also shows early positive peaks, but there are examples of larger early elevation (e.g., 3.4384 in Cat1 sample 2) and also earlier sharper downward excursions (Cat1 sample 3 has an early deep negative at index ~5: \u22121.48). In short: MI more often shows either unusually large early elevation or an abrupt early fall.\n\n- Middle (indices 25\u201359) \u2014 the ST segment equivalent\n  - This is the most diagnostically important region in these series.\n  - Category 0: typically a sustained negative plateau followed by recovery toward baseline/positive; the negative troughs commonly lie around \u22121.0 to \u22122.0 but the duration of the deep depression is relatively shorter and the return toward positive is smoother.\n  - Category 1: shows more obvious ST abnormalities: deeper and/or longer lasting depressions (several series display sustained values near \u22121.5 to \u22122.1 for many consecutive points; e.g., \u22122.1668 in Cat1 sample 1) or, less commonly, a prominent elevated arch immediately before/after (sample 2\u2019s large early elevation then deep depression). The MI middle segment is often wider (longer duration away from baseline) and has steeper slopes in and out of the trough compared with normals.\n\n- Late (indices 60\u201395) \u2014 the T\u2011wave / recovery region\n  - Category 0: tends to show a smoother, moderate positive plateau (\u22480.4\u20131.1) with relatively symmetric small oscillations (a rounded T\u2011wave like shape). Final upswing to \u22481.25\u20131.37 is seen in some samples.\n  - Category 1: T\u2011region is more variable: some series show sharper, higher, or more irregular T peaks (e.g., Cat1 sample 3 reaches \u22481.22) and more frequent small negative/inverted excursions or asymmetry in the small waves following the ST segment. This corresponds to \u201cabnormally sharp\u201d or asymmetric T waves often described in acute/necrotic phases.\n\nCross\u2011sample observations and overlap\n- There is substantial overlap in absolute amplitudes between classes (several category\u20110 samples have troughs near \u22122.0 and peaks above 2.0), so amplitude alone is not a clean separator.\n- Distinguishing features are temporal/shape features: (a) duration of ST deviation (how many consecutive points are well off baseline), (b) polarity and curvature of the ST deviation (arched elevation vs sustained depression), and (c) T\u2011wave sharpness/asymmetry (steepness and sign changes).\n- MI samples more often show longer-lasting ST deviation and more abrupt transitions (sharper slopes) and occasionally extreme early elevation; normals are smoother and their ST segment more often returns to the baseline more quickly.\n\nPractical summary for classification\n- Compute features over the middle window (e.g., indices ~15\u201340): mean and min, duration below a small negative threshold, slope into/out of trough.\n- Measure T\u2011region skewness/sharpness in the late window (e.g., indices ~60\u201390): peak sharpness, sign changes, symmetry.\n- Use these temporal/shape features rather than single-point amplitude to separate normal vs MI in this small dataset."

According to the earlier pattern analysis the strongest MI cues are pronounced ST abnormalities (either marked elevation or sustained depression), sharp transitions into/out of the deviation, and irregular/sharp T\u2011region morphology. This new trace shows repeated, large ST\u2011elevation\u2013like events (peak amplitudes well above the normal class peaks seen in the training examples and similar to the extreme early elevation observed in the MI examples), with abrupt slopes and sustained deviation from baseline \u2014 all consistent with an acute ST\u2011elevation myocardial infarction pattern. There is no smooth, symmetric T\u2011wave region typical of the normal class, and no prolonged modest negative plateau pattern that would indicate a normal heartbeat. Possible artifacting/repetition of identical values slightly lowers certainty, but the predominant diagnostic features point to class 1."

            "content": "The two classes are a normal heartbeat(class 0) and a Myocardial Infarction(class 1). The electrocardiogram of a normal heartbeat and that of a myocardial infarction are quite different, mainly reflected in the following core features:\n Normal heartbeat: The ST segment is straight and coincides with the baseline. T waves are usually upright and symmetrical.\nMyocardial infarction: The ST segment will show obvious abnormalities. The most common two situations are: one is the arched back upward type elevation, and the other is significant depression.

            "content": "Summary\n- Clear differences are present. Broadly they match the clinical description: the \u201cnormal\u201d class (Category 0) shows a large QRS-like excursion into negative values followed by a relatively smooth, upright positive T\u2011wave/plateau; the \u201cmyocardial infarction\u201d class (Category 1) shows more frequent and larger ST abnormalities (both prominent early elevations in some samples and prolonged depressions in others) and more variable / abnormal T\u2011wave morphology (sharper changes and more polarity/shape variability).\n- There is some within-class variability (not every MI sample looks the same), but the patterns below are consistent across the provided examples.\n\nSegmented comparison (early, middle, late). I split each 96\u2011point series into early (indices 0\u201319), middle (20\u201359) and late (60\u201395) to highlight clinically relevant windows (QRS \u2192 ST \u2192 T/return-to-baseline).\n\n1) Early segment (indices 0\u201319) \u2014 QRS / immediate post\u2011QRS\n- Category 0 (normal)\n  - Large positive onset (peaks ~1.2\u20132.7), then a rapid fall into a large negative trough by indices ~10\u201322 (values down to about \u22122.0). Example: Sample 1 peaks \u22482.04 then falls to \u2248\u22122.07 around index 22.\n  - The initial peak sizes are moderately large but generally \u2264 ~2.7 in these examples.\n- Category 1 (MI)\n  - More extreme and more heterogeneous early behavior. Example: Sample 2 has a very large early elevation (peaking \u22483.4 at indices \u22482\u20133), which is larger than any Category 0 early peak.\n  - Some MI traces also show earlier transient positive/negative swings or slower recovery immediately after the trough (more irregular than Category 0).\n\n2) Middle segment (indices 20\u201359) \u2014 ST segment and early T-wave\n- Category 0 (normal)\n  - After the trough the series rises to a relatively stable, smooth positive plateau (roughly 0.3\u20131.1) that is fairly consistent across indices \u224830\u201360. This looks like an upright, broad T\u2011wave / ST returning toward baseline. Example: Sample 1 shows values \u22480.4\u20131.06 over indices 30\u201360.\n  - ST region is relatively flat / smoothly positive (no abrupt sustained deviation from the local baseline).\n- Category 1 (MI)\n  - Clear ST abnormalities are visible:\n    - Some MI traces show marked early ST elevation (example: Sample 2 early huge elevation followed by more complex behavior).\n    - Others show prolonged ST depression / sustained deep negative values around the trough window, or a slower, less smooth return to positive values (values around \u22121.7 to \u22122.0 persist across more points in some samples).\n  - T\u2011wave morphology in this middle region is more variable: sharper rises, occasional transient inversions or lower amplitude compared with Category 0\u2019s broad upright plateau.\n\n3) Late segment (indices 60\u201395) \u2014 late T-wave / return-to-baseline\n- Category 0 (normal)\n  - Late part tends to stay near a modest positive plateau with small, smooth fluctuations (typical values ~0.0 to 0.9), ending in a modest positive value in the examples (e.g., final values \u22480.23\u20131.37).\n  - T\u2011waves appear overall upright and relatively symmetric/smooth.\n- Category 1 (MI)\n  - Late behavior is more irregular: some MI examples show recovery to positive values but with more abrupt variability, occasional late negative deflections, or sharper peaks. For example, Sample 2 of Category 1 has low/negative points in the late window (values around \u22120.29 \u2026 \u22120.1 in a stretch), rather than the consistently upright plateau seen in Category 0.\n  - T\u2011wave shape can be sharper or intermittently inverted compared to Category 0.\n\nConcrete distinguishing markers that appear in these samples\n- Early excessive ST elevation: Category 1 sample(s) show much larger early peaks (e.g., \u22483.4) not seen in Category 0 (max \u22482.7).\n- Prolonged or deeper ST depression: several Category 1 traces show deeper/sustained negative values in the middle window (\u2248\u22121.7 to \u22122.0) or a slower recovery to the positive plateau.\n- T\u2011wave morphology: Category 0 shows a smoother, upright positive plateau (broad T), whereas Category 1 shows more abrupt, variable or sometimes inverted/sharp T\u2011wave shapes.\n\nCaveats\n- There is overlap in some gross features (both classes have deep negative troughs and later positive segments), so simple pointwise amplitude alone may not perfectly separate classes. The discriminative cues are the pattern of ST deviation (elevation vs. depression and its duration) and the T\u2011wave shape (broader/upright vs. sharper/variable/inverted).\n- With only three examples per class here, these observations are illustrative but should be validated on the full dataset. Quantitative features to extract for robust classification would include: ST deviation relative to pre\u2011QRS baseline, duration of ST deviation, T\u2011wave amplitude and polarity, and rise/fall slopes after the trough."

Clinically relevant cues from the training examples tied to MI \u2014 ST\u2011segment deviation (sustained deviation from baseline) and sharper, more abrupt T\u2011wave/return morphology \u2014 are a better match to this trace than the Category 0 examples, which display a deep trough and a smoother, upright positive T\u2011wave plateau. The highly repetitive, step\u2011like alternation and the sustained negative baseline segments therefore favor classification as myocardial infarction (class 1). (Note: confidence is moderate because the trace is highly regular/repetitive and could be an atypical or synthetic variant; a larger labeled corpus would increase certainty.)"

The electrocardiogram of a normal heartbeat and that of a myocardial infarction are quite different, mainly reflected in the following core features:\n Normal heartbeat: The ST segment is straight and coincides with the baseline. T waves are usually upright and symmetrical.\nMyocardial infarction: The ST segment will show obvious abnormalities. The most common two situations are: one is the arched back upward type elevation, and the other is significant depression. The T wave becomes abnormally sharp (acute phase) or symmetrically inverted (necrotic phase). You will be provided with two time series samples from each category of this dataset.

            "content": "Short answer: clear differences are present. Compared with the \u201cnormal\u201d class, the myocardial\u2011infarction (MI) series show larger, more abrupt ST deviations (either pronounced early elevation or sustained depression), more prolonged/marked negative troughs in the mid portion, and more variable / less smooth T\u2011wave morphology (sharper peaks or inversions) rather than the relatively flat ST and smooth upright T waves seen in the normal class.\n\nHow I compared them\n- I split each length\u201196 trace into three rough segments for interpretation:\n  - Early: indices 0\u201331 (initial P/QRS/ST region)\n  - Middle: indices 32\u201363 (ST segment / early T region)\n  - Late: indices 64\u201395 (T/post\u2011T / recovery)\n- I inspected amplitude ranges, shape (smooth vs abrupt), polarity (upright vs inverted), and duration of deviations in each segment and used representative values from the provided samples.\n\nDetailed, segmentwise differences with examples\n1) Early (0\u201331)\n- Category 0 (normal)\n  - Consistently large initial positive deflections around ~1.8\u20132.7 in all samples (e.g. Cat0 sample1 indices 0\u20134 \u2248 [2.04, 1.88, 1.91, 2.47]).\n  - Initial descent after the peak is relatively smooth.\n- Category 1 (MI)\n  - More variable early behavior: some MI traces have very large early ST elevation (example: Cat1 sample2 indices 1\u20133 \u2248 [2.19, 3.44, 3.31]) while others start smaller or already show early negative deflections.\n  - This produces either an \u201carched back\u201d elevation pattern or an abnormal early dip in different MI examples \u2014 i.e. MI shows both types of ST abnormality in the early window whereas normals are more uniform.\n\n2) Middle (32\u201363) \u2014 the ST segment region\n- Category 0 (normal)\n  - After the early trough, series rebound to a relatively steady, modest positive plateau (typical mid values \u2248 0.4\u20131.0). The transitions are smooth and the ST region does not show large, prolonged deviations from that baseline.\n  - Example: Cat0 sample2 indices ~40\u201360 are steady around 0.1\u20130.7.\n- Category 1 (MI)\n  - More pronounced, prolonged negative troughs or depressions that last over many time points (e.g. Cat1 sample1 and sample3 show sustained values near \u22121.4 to \u22122.0 across the middle segment).\n  - In other MI traces the ST segment is elevated/peaked rather than flat (see early elevation in sample2 which then leads into abnormal mid behaviour). In short: MI mid\u2011segment shows larger-magnitude ST deviation (either sustained depression or marked elevation), and the deviation is often longer in duration than in normals.\n\n3) Late (64\u201395) \u2014 T wave and recovery\n- Category 0 (normal)\n  - Late segment shows relatively smooth, upright T\u2011wave / recovery with modest amplitude (roughly 0.3\u20131.2) and few abrupt polarity changes. T waves look rounded/symmetric rather than spiky.\n  - Example: Cat0 sample1 indices ~40\u201380 show a stable positive plateau with small oscillations, finishing with a gradual rise.\n- Category 1 (MI)\n  - T waves are more variable: some MI traces display sharper/acute peaks in the late region and some show inversions or transient negative deflections (consistent with T\u2011wave abnormality in MI). Example: Cat1 sample2 shows an abrupt sequence of fluctuating values and transient negatives in the late region; Cat1 sample3 has higher late peaks (~0.88\u20131.22) but also abrupt variability.\n  - Overall, MI late morphology is less symmetric and more irregular (sharper peaks, occasional inversions) compared with normals.\n\nSimple numeric/shape markers that separate the classes (practical takeaways)\n- Early peak amplitude alone is not perfectly discriminative (normals often have high early peaks, but some MI have very high peaks too), but the shape after the early peak is informative:\n  - ST deviation magnitude & duration in the middle segment (sustained depression or elevation) is a strong discriminant: MI shows larger absolute ST deviations and longer persistence.\n  - T\u2011wave polarity and sharpness in the late segment: MI more often shows sharper (acute) or inverted T waves; normals show smoother, upright T waves.\n  - MI traces are generally more abrupt and variable (higher slope changes) around transitions (peak \u2192 trough \u2192 recovery).\n\nBottom line\n- There are consistent, clinically meaningful differences: normals \u2192 straight ST coincident with baseline and smooth upright T waves; MI \u2192 clear ST abnormalities (either arching elevation or sustained depression) and abnormal T\u2011wave shapes (sharp or inverted). These differences appear most clearly in the middle (ST) and late (T) segments and are visible in the provided samples."

When segmented roughly into early / middle / late behavior:\n  - Early: repeated large positive deflections (~2.07\u20132.18) interleaved with brief negative values \u2014 not a single smooth QRS/ST but abrupt high elevations in places.\n  - Middle: a very long, sustained negative plateau around \u22120.55 (with occasional \u22120.50 to \u22120.45) persisting for many time points \u2014 characteristic of prolonged ST depression rather than the straight baseline expected in normal beats.\n  - Late / remainder: repeated abrupt switches between high positive blocks and the sustained negative baseline, producing sharp, non\u2011symmetrical/irregular T\u2011like morphology rather than the smooth, upright T waves seen in normals.\nThese sustained mid\u2011segment depressions and abrupt, irregular T/ST behavior are hallmark MI differences noted in the training samples, so the trace is best classified as myocardial infarction."

The electrocardiogram of a normal heartbeat and that of a myocardial infarction are quite different, mainly reflected in the following core features:\n Normal heartbeat: The ST segment is straight and coincides with the baseline. T waves are usually upright and symmetrical.\nMyocardial infarction: The ST segment will show obvious abnormalities. The most common two situations are: one is the arched back upward type elevation, and the other is significant depression. The T wave becomes abnormally sharp (acute phase) or symmetrically inverted (necrotic phase). You will be provided with two time series samples from each category of this dataset.
