{
  "Peaks are wide and rounded with gradual rises and falls spanning roughly 40–60 steps, showing small local inflections rather than sharp, narrow spikes.": "common feature",
  "A clear medium‑frequency quasi‑periodic oscillation (~10–20 time steps) overlays the plateau and flanks, producing regularly spaced small bumps rather than purely random noise.": "common feature",
  "Two dominant broad maxima appear near ~40–60 and ~180–200 time steps in both series, producing a clear bimodal pattern with comparable peak heights (~1.3–1.7).": "common feature",
  "The fine‑scale ripples are amplitude‑modulated: micro‑wiggle magnitude increases on the steep rising/falling flanks and near peak summits, and is reduced across the central depressed plateau.": "common feature",
  "The inter-peak segment forms a depressed plateau (≈-0.5 to -1.0) containing several low-amplitude oscillatory bumps and shallow valleys centered in the middle of the sequence.": "common feature",
  "Approximate mirror symmetry about the midpoint: the left and right halves show similar contour and timing (major peak positions, slopes, and trough depths) reflecting a near-reflectional symmetry.": "common feature"
