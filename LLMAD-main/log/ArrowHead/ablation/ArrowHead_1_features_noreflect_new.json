{
  "Peak crests are broad/flattened — dominant lobes show short, nearly flat summits spanning several time steps rather than sharp single apices.": "common feature",
  "Inter-peak spacing is highly consistent (≈120–140 time steps, ≈130), giving a stable quasi‑periodic cycle between the two main lobes.": "common feature",
  "The right (second) dominant lobe is reproducibly marginally taller than the left by ~0.1–0.2 amplitude units, producing a subtle but systematic amplitude asymmetry.": "common feature",
  "The central trough commonly exhibits a double‑dip morphology: two distinct local minima separated by a narrow positive spike (a small central sub‑peak).": "common feature",
  "A pronounced central trough between ~100–140 that typically reaches ≈-1.0 to -1.2 and contains a small secondary bump around 120–130.": "common feature",
  "A reproducible shoulder/inflection on the rising limb of the second dominant lobe around ~150–165: a brief flattening/slowdown precedes the final climb to the right peak.": "common feature",
  "Waveform zero‑crossings occur at highly repeatable phases (near ≈100 and ≈150), producing consistent baseline crossing alignment across series.": "common feature"
