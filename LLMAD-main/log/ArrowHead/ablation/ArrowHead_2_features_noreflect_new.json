{
  "All series cross the zero baseline during the initial ramp to the first peak and again during the fall after the second peak, placing zero-crossings consistently in the outer thirds of the cycle rather than near the central trough.": "common feature",
  "Consistent left/right asymmetry of main peaks: the earlier peak is typically narrower/sharper, while the later peak is broader and often shows a flattened/plateaued top.": "common feature",
  "The central trough is consistently left-skewed — its minimum occurs slightly before the exact midpoint (≈100–130), producing a shorter descent and longer recovery to the second peak.": "common feature",
  "Recurrent secondary shoulders or mid-slope local bumps appear on the up/down slopes and in the trough-to-peak transitions (small auxiliary peaks around t≈90–160).": "partial-sample feature"
