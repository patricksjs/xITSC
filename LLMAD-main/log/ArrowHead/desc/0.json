"A secondary peak occurs around the 150th time step in all series, indicating a consistent local maximum.\nA consistent horizontal trough is observed around the 125th time step across all series.\nThe amplitude oscillates within a narrow band between the 100th and 125th time steps, establishing a local flat pattern.\nNotable gradual increases in amplitude are observed between the 100th and 150th time steps, suggesting a shift before the secondary peak.\nClear oscillations appear between the 150th and 175th time steps with decreasing amplitudes leading towards subsequent peaks.\nThe segment between the 100th and 125th time steps exhibits a stable oscillation frequency repeatedly.\n"
