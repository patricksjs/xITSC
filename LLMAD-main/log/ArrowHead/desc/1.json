"Each time series exhibits a distinct symmetrical pattern around the midpoint, reinforcing the overall shape characteristics.\nA noticeable gradual rise in amplitude is observed between 100 and 150 time steps, indicating an additional upward trend phase.\nDistinct troughs are observed around 120 and 220 time steps, creating additional symmetrical features.\nA secondary trough consistently appears around 150 time steps across all series, enhancing the multi-trough feature previously noted.\n"
