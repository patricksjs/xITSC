  "Bimodal structure with two prominent smooth peaks occurring around time steps 50 and 180-200, separated by a deep valley trough at approximately time step 110-120, creating a characteristic double-hump pattern.": "common feature",
  "Series begins and ends at similar low amplitude values (around -1.5 to -1.7), showing strong symmetry in the boundary conditions with steep initial ascent and final descent.": "common feature",
  "Middle segment (time steps 100-150) exhibits a sustained negative valley with minor oscillations, maintaining relatively stable low amplitude around -0.8 to -1.0 before the second major peak.": "common feature",
  "The first peak (around time step 50) consistently exhibits a slightly sharper, more pointed apex compared to the second peak (around time step 180-200), which displays a broader, more rounded or plateau-like summit across all samples.": "common feature",
  "The transition zones between peaks and valleys show asymmetric descent/ascent rates: the descent from the first peak (time steps 50-110) is more gradual and linear, while the ascent to the second peak (time steps 150-180) is steeper and more rapid.": "common feature",
  "Both peaks exhibit extended plateau regions with high-frequency micro-oscillations or serrations along their summits (time steps 50-75 and 175-200), rather than smooth continuous curves, creating a jagged texture at maximum amplitude.": "common feature",
  "The valley region displays a characteristic shallow secondary undulation or mini-peak around time steps 120-135, creating a W-shaped pattern within the broader trough between the two main peaks.": "common feature",
  "The amplitude range shows consistent boundaries with peak maxima constrained between 1.0-1.3 and valley minima between -1.2 to -1.3, demonstrating limited vertical variance across the entire series compared to the horizontal temporal span.": "common feature",
  "The zero-crossing points occur at highly consistent locations: around time steps 20-25 (ascending), 95-105 (descending), 155-165 (ascending), and 230-235 (descending), creating four distinct amplitude zones with predictable transition timing.": "common feature"
