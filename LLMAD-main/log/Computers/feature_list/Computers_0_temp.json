  "Generally, transitions are brief and discrete, with minimal long intermediate plateaus; in some series, a sustained two-level plateau may occur in mid-series, characterized by a flat top and sharp edges.": "common feature",
  "Sparse, recurring rectangular bursts: one or more short high-level plateaus embedded in an otherwise near-zero baseline, often with mid-series timing and a two-level pattern featuring an abrupt transition to a flat elevated plateau.": "common feature",
  "The elevated plateau during bursts is notably flat with minimal within-burst fluctuations; occasional small, step-like sublevels may form a subdued staircase pattern, but internal variability remains low.": "common feature",
  "Edge transitions are typically sharp and may be symmetric or near-symmetric, with rise and fall edges of similar duration in most cases.": "common feature",
  "Sharp edges with flat tops: bursts rise and fall abruptly, with a nearly constant high level during each burst, emphasizing minimal intra-burst variance.": "common feature",
  "Early-stage oscillations may occur but are not prolonged or high-variance; the core pattern in most series is the burst with flat top and sharp edges, rather than dense multi-scale activity.": "common feature",
  "Sharp mid-series transition to a sustained flat regime, creating a two-level overall pattern with a clear level change around one-third to one-half of the series.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Emergence of a three-level, multi-plateau structure: an initial high level, a substantial mid-level plateau, and a distinct late negative/low plateau, indicating two interior transitions.": "partial-sample feature",
  "End-segment settling into a low-variance negative baseline that remains constant to the end, contrasting with earlier positive plateaus.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Quasi-periodic timing: bursts cluster around mid-series and late-series windows, suggesting regular event-like timing; in some series, bursts cluster in a mid-series window approximately steps 300-470.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Multiple distinct burst windows within a single series, separated by longer quiet intervals, rather than a single contiguous burst period.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Isolated end-of-series spikes that occur abruptly near the final time steps and do not form a sustained high plateau.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Burst onset time is highly consistent across some series, occurring around steps 590–610 with a similar duration of 50–60 steps.": "partial-sample feature",
  "After the burst ends, the signal shows a brief, low-amplitude jitter around zero before fully stabilizing.": "partial-sample feature",
  "A two-phase burst, with an initial higher-frequency jitter that gradually shifts to a slightly lower-frequency ripple during the mid-burst.": "partial-sample feature",
  "A two-stage end-phase: after the main burst, a short low-variance lull precedes the final return to baseline.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Bursts cluster in a late-series window (roughly steps 420–520) in some series, indicating a common event timing.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Pre-burst gradual ramp into the elevated plateau: a slow, stepwise rise starts before the main burst cluster, rather than an immediate jump to high values.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Brief dips back toward baseline during the elevated window: short, isolated returns toward baseline values occur within the otherwise elevated period.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Two or more discrete, short elevated plateaus, or a single extended plateau with brief, low-variance relaxations, embedded in a near-zero baseline, with abrupt on/off transitions and minimal intra-plateau fluctuations.": "partial-sample feature"
