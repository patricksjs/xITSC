  "One or more high-activity events (which can be either short or prolonged sustained plateaus, or very brief, high-amplitude spikes) separated by long quiet stretches — piecewise stationarity: low-variance baseline vs. brief high-variance episodes.": "common feature",
  "When active events are sustained plateaus, they are quantized into a few discrete sub-levels, often exhibiting abrupt, step-like transitions between these levels — many short, stable micro-steps rather than a single constant value. However, some active events are brief, high-amplitude spikes that do not exhibit such internal plateau structure.": "common feature",
  "Short, occasional intra-event excursions: brief seconds-long spikes or dips that rise above (or fall below) the active event's levels, producing momentary outliers. These can occur within sustained plateaus or as standalone spikes. Alternatively, some plateaus exhibit rapid, noisy fluctuations or oscillations between discrete sub-levels, which may or may not be perfectly regular.": "common feature",
  "Long, highly stable baseline (often negative, sometimes significantly below zero, e.g., around -1.0 to -1.2, but can also be around zero) with tiny, regular high-frequency ripples superimposed.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Sudden, step-like positive plateaus (sustained peaks typically up to ~3) with abrupt onsets and offsets. Some sustained plateaus may extend to the end of the observation window without clear offset. Alternatively, some series exhibit very brief, high-amplitude spikes (reaching significantly higher values, e.g., up to ~8) with sharp symmetrical rise and fall.": "partial-sample feature",
  "When active events are sustained plateaus, they show very regular, high-frequency alternating up-down micro-pulses (square/sawtooth-like zigzags) superimposed on the plateau, distinct from baseline ripples.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Transition edges exhibit brief overshoot/undershoot transients (clusters of spikes) at plateau onset and offset. For brief spike events, the entire event can be considered transient.": "partial-sample feature",
  "The intra-plateau micro-oscillation period, when present, is very stable and nearly identical across series.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Some series show secondary short reactivations near the end — late positive plateaus or brief spikes following inactive periods.": "partial-sample feature"
