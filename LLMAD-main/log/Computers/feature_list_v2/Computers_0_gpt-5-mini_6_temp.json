  "One or frequently multiple high-activity events (which can be either short or prolonged sustained plateaus, or very brief, high-amplitude spikes) separated by long quiet stretches — piecewise stationarity: low-variance baseline vs. brief high-variance episodes.": "common feature",
  "When active events are sustained plateaus, they are quantized into a few discrete sub-levels, often exhibiting abrupt, step-like transitions between these levels — many short, stable micro-steps rather than a single constant value. However, some active events are brief, high-amplitude spikes that do not exhibit such internal plateau structure.": "common feature",
  "Short, occasional intra-event excursions: brief seconds-long spikes or dips that rise above (or fall below) the active event's levels, producing momentary outliers. These can occur within sustained plateaus or as standalone spikes. Alternatively, some plateaus exhibit rapid, noisy fluctuations or oscillations between discrete sub-levels, which may or may not be perfectly regular.": "common feature",
  "Long, highly stable baseline (often negative, frequently ranging from approximately -0.4 to -1.2, but sometimes near zero) with tiny, regular high-frequency ripples superimposed.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Sudden positive plateaus (typically peaking around ~3), which may appear as relatively flat step-like segments or exhibit dense, continuous high-frequency oscillations/spikes throughout their duration, with abrupt onsets and offsets. Alternatively, very brief high-amplitude spikes (reaching values up to ~8) with sharp symmetrical rise and fall occur in some series.": "partial-sample feature",
  "When active events are sustained plateaus, they show very regular, high-frequency alternating up-down micro-pulses (square/sawtooth-like zigzags) superimposed on the plateau, distinct from baseline ripples.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Transition edges exhibit brief overshoot/undershoot transients (clusters of spikes) at plateau onset and offset. For brief spike events, the entire event can be considered transient.": "partial-sample feature",
  "The intra-plateau micro-oscillation period, when present, is very stable and nearly identical across series.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Some series show secondary short reactivations near the end — late positive plateaus or brief spikes following inactive periods.": "partial-sample feature"
