{
  "Long prolonged low-level baseline occupying most of the series with very low variance until a late change.": "common feature",
  "A sharp, late-series regime shift (abrupt step up) to a sustained higher amplitude around the 550–650 time-step window.": "delete feature",
  "The elevated plateau shows discrete micro-steps and intermittent short downward spikes (stepped plateau with transient drops).": "common feature",
  "Persistent high-frequency, small-amplitude zigzagging present on both baseline and plateau (regular pulse-like oscillations).": "partial-sample feature",
  "Plateau events are transient — the elevated regime is bounded and commonly ends with an abrupt drop back to the low baseline before the series finishes.": "common feature",
  "The elevated segment is multi-phased: an initial higher-amplitude burst is frequently followed by a progressive, stepwise decline to lower plateau levels.": "common feature",
  "A subset of series shows a small precursor/intermediate rise just before the main jump, indicating a two-stage or prelude change rather than a single instantaneous shift.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Isolated secondary spikes: many series show one or more brief, standalone upward spikes separated in time from the main elevated plateau (a distinct transient event outside the main regime).": "common feature",
  "Occupation of discrete amplitude bands: values cluster around a few repeatable levels (baseline, intermediate, high), implying quantized usage states across records.": "common feature",
  "Post-drop rebound: a small transient upward blip often occurs immediately after the abrupt drop back to baseline.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Asymmetric transitions: the step-up onset is typically sharper/faster than the step-down or subsequent decay, producing skewed rise-versus-fall edges.": "common feature",
  "Recurrent multiple elevated episodes: series often contain two or more separate sustained high-amplitude segments (distinct plateaus) separated by returns to the low baseline, not just a single main plateau.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Baseline offset below zero: the long low-level baseline is commonly a stable negative offset (around −0.4) rather than centered at zero.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Onset timing clustered mid-to-late: in these examples the step-up frequently occurs earlier than the previously noted 550–650 window, clustering around ~340–420 time steps.": "partial-sample feature"
