{
  "Sharp, late-day onset: all series show a sudden rise beginning around time step ~80, reaching a sustained high level for roughly 6–12 steps before an abrupt fall near ~90.": "common feature",
  "Micro zigzag baseline: long pre-peak sections have small, regular alternating negative/less-negative ticks (two-point high-frequency oscillation) of nearly constant amplitude.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Step-like transitions with jagged plateau: both rise and fall are steep, almost vertical, and the elevated plateau contains small jagged fluctuations rather than a smooth peak.": "common feature",
  "Intermittent, isolated one- to two-step pre-peak spikes occur earlier in the day (sporadic narrow pulses around time steps ~10–60), distinct from the steady micro-zigzag baseline.": "delete feature",
  "A brief negative undershoot below baseline immediately follows the abrupt fall in several series (a short-lived dip lasting a few steps).": "delete feature",
  "Main elevated plateau amplitudes are consistently moderate and clustered (~2.0–3.5 units), often exhibiting a small internal secondary bump (two-tier plateau) rather than a single uniform level.": "common feature",
  "A small consistent negative baseline offset (~ -0.2 to -0.5) before and after the main event, so the pre-peak \"quiet\" level is below zero rather than centered at zero.": "common feature",
  "A repeatable immediate precursor: a one- to two-step slight uptick or ramp occurring 1–3 steps before the large, sharp onset in every series.": "delete feature",
  "Some series exhibit abrupt downward steps producing a sustained negative plateau (deep trough) instead of a rise, i.e., a sudden drop around steps ~65–75 to ~-1.5 that remains for many steps.": "delete feature",
  "Main-event timing is bimodal: distinct clusters occur mid-day (~35–40) or very late (~90–95), not exclusively around the previously reported ~80.": "delete feature",
  "A few series show a single, isolated very high-amplitude spike (~4–5 units) near step ~90–95 with no preceding elevated plateau.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Several series contain multiple distinct step events in sequence (e.g., rise → fall → separate late spike), producing two or more well-separated plateaus within one day.": "delete feature",
  "Very long, nearly perfectly flat quiescent stretches appear (stable constant value with almost zero variance) lasting >70 time steps before a sudden event.": "common feature"
