  "Sharp, step-like regime changes at the start and end of each active window — abrupt jumps up from a flat negative baseline and abrupt returns to it.": "common feature",
  "Active windows show a stable elevated mean with small, fast oscillations plus occasional short high transients (peaks ~2–2.5) concentrated near the middle of those windows.": "common feature",
  "Active-window onsets often show a 1–3 step overshoot spike above the elevated mean immediately after the step-up, then a rapid settling to the window’s typical level.": "common feature",
  "Within active windows there are frequent short negative troughs—sharp drops below the elevated mean lasting 1–4 time steps (not just positive transients).": "common feature",
  "The exact start/end times jitter by several time steps across series, causing small misalignments and occasional partial overlap or fragmentation of the morning/evening windows.": "common feature",
  "The morning active period is typically more jagged and higher-variance with multiple sub-peaks, while the evening period is a longer, smoother plateau with smaller amplitude fluctuations.": "common feature",
  "Many evening plateaus display a near-regular alternating up–down ripple (period ≈1–2 time steps), producing a sawtooth-like high-frequency oscillation superimposed on the plateau.": "delete feature",
  "Several series show a slow, monotonic decay across the evening plateau (level drifts down gradually from its initial elevated value over the window).": "partial-sample feature",
  "Morning activations sometimes begin with a short multi-step ramp (2–4 incremental rises) rather than a single instantaneous jump, producing a brief rising slope before the plateau.": "common feature",
  "Evening plateaus often exhibit a distinct two-tier level: an initial higher plateau that steps down once or twice into a lower, sustained plateau (clear stepwise level change during the evening active window).": "delete feature",
  "Many series end with a sustained negative undershoot after the evening drop—several consecutive time steps below the baseline, not just an instantaneous return.": "common feature",
  "A small, short-lived pre-evening shoulder (modest elevation or bump) commonly appears just before the main evening plateau (a precursor plateau around t≈58–68).": "partial-sample feature",
  "A burst of increased variability or one very large transient often appears immediately before the evening step-down, producing a pronounced spike-cluster just prior to the final drop from the evening plateau.": "delete feature",
  "Small low-amplitude jitter or micro-spikes commonly appear in the baseline 1–5 steps before morning/evening step-ups, acting as brief noisy precursors to the main activation.": "partial-sample feature"
