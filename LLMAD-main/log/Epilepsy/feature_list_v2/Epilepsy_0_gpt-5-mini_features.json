  "Late-phase regime change around steps ~150–170: all show a behavioral shift—deeper valleys (img1), bursty oscillations (img2), or an abrupt drop to a negative baseline (img3).": "common feature",
  "Downward asymmetry: negative excursions are larger/more pronounced than positive peaks, yielding valley-dominated waveforms across series.": "common feature",
  "Mixed-scale dynamics: slow baseline drift with superimposed short oscillations; smooth stretches punctuated by brief higher-frequency activity; amplitude mostly confined within about ±1 until the late disturbance.": "common feature",
  "Mid-series mild crest: each sequence exhibits an above-zero segment in the middle portion (roughly steps 60–120), appearing as a short plateau or gentle hump.": "common feature",
  "Trough timing bands: valleys cluster in two common windows—mid (~60–80) and late (~150–170), forming preferred dip intervals.": "common feature",
  "Positive end-state: all traces finish slightly above zero, with the final steps settling at a modest positive level.": "common feature"
