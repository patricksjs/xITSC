  "Quasi-periodic oscillation with consistent cycle length (~9–12 time steps) and low period jitter, producing regular repeated pulses across the series.": "common feature",
  "Asymmetric pulses: narrow, sharp positive peaks with larger magnitude and shorter duration than the wider, smoother negative troughs (positive skew).": "partial-sample feature",
  "Positive baseline offset: oscillations are centered above zero, giving a sustained positive DC bias across the time series.": "delete feature",
  "Repeated small pre-peaks or shoulder bumps immediately before the main positive pulse, producing a consistently multi-modal peak shape within each cycle.": "delete feature",
  "A beat-like alternation in cycle amplitudes — successive peaks show a pattern of larger then slightly smaller magnitudes across many cycles.": "delete feature",
  "Occasional isolated deep negative transients (outlier troughs) that are much deeper than typical troughs and momentarily break the regular pattern.": "delete feature",
  "Noticeable rise in high-frequency jitter/noise and loss of clear periodicity toward the final segment of the series.": "delete feature"
