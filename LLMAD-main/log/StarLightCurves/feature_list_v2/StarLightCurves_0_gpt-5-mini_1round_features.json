  "Very smooth, low-noise morphology with continuous inflection (no sharp spikes); transitions are gradual and rounded.": "common feature",
  "Asymmetric shape: relatively quicker rise and steep fall into the trough, followed by a slower, steady recovery; peak≈+1.3–1.6 and trough≈−1.5–−1.8 (peak–trough ≈3.0).": "common feature",
