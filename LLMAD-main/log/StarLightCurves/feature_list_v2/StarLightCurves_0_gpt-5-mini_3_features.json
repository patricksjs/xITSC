  "A single dominant low-frequency cycle: in most series, a broad positive peak in the first third (peak time ≈ 180–320), a deep trough near the middle (minimum time ≈ 450–550), then a mostly monotonic recovery toward the end. The cycle is the primary large-scale structure and sets the peak–trough baseline for secondary metrics.": "common feature",
  "Very smooth, low-noise morphology with continuous, rounded inflection (no sharp spikes): transitions are gradual and rounded, showing relatively low variance of curvature on smoothed data. Prefer class‑0 when the waveform looks like a single rounded cycle rather than a sequence of repeated oscillations.": "common feature",
  "Asymmetric shape: a relatively quicker rise into the main hump and a moderate, smoother descent into the trough (the descent is typically less abrupt than in class‑2), followed by a slower, steady recovery; typical peak ≈ +1.3–1.6 and typical trough ≈ −1.5–−1.8 (peak–trough ≈ 3.0) in most series.": "common feature",
  "Trough timing, width and depth clarified: trough minimum most often occurs ≈ 450–550 and the deepest sustained minima in the majority of series are within ≈ −1.5 to −1.8; when the trough reaches ≤ ~−1.9 or remains very near minimum for long durations, treat the series with caution because it approaches class‑2 territory. Do not use trough depth alone; combine with plateau duration and descent rate per the decision heuristics below.": "common feature",
  "Descent and recovery rate cues (quantified): measure the descent length as the interval containing the central ~80% of the drop (time between ~90th and ~10th percentile levels of the decline). Recommended thresholds: favor class‑0 when that interval ≳120 samples; favor class‑2 when ≲60–70 samples; treat 60–120 samples as an ambiguous band requiring secondary checks. Very abrupt large‑magnitude negative slopes concentrated over ≈50–150 samples tend to indicate class‑2, whereas class‑0 tends to show a broader main drop (≳120 samples) with smoother slope changes.": "common feature",
  "Low high-frequency content and monotonic recovery (quantified ripple metric): define ripple amplitude as the RMS of the high‑pass residual after applying a lowpass smoother (suggested: Savitzky‑Golay window 11–31 samples or a Gaussian smoother with similar effective width) and removing trend. Normalize ripple amplitude by the peak–trough range. Guidance: favor class‑0 when post‑trough ripple amplitude < ~15% of the peak–trough range; treat 15–25% as borderline and require other class‑0 cues; > ~25% favors class‑2. Typical class‑0 recoveries are largely monotonic on a smoothed curve with only very small ripples.": "common feature",
  "Spectral/curvature cue (quantified): prefer class‑0 when spectral energy above mid frequencies is low (e.g., lowpass energy ratio high) and variance of the smoothed second derivative (curvature variance) is small after normalizing by peak–trough amplitude. Suggested normalization: curvature_variance_norm = Var(d2(smoothed series))/ (peak–trough)^2. In practice, low curvature_variance_norm indicates smooth rounded inflections typical of class‑0; higher values indicate sharper inflections or repeated ripples that favor other classes.": "common feature",
  "Trough‑plateau duration thresholds: measure plateau duration as the count of consecutive samples within ~5–10% of the trough minimum. Guidance: if plateau duration ≥100–120 samples, lean toward class‑2; if ≤40–50 samples, lean toward class‑0; treat 50–100 samples as an ambiguous zone to be resolved with slope and ripple metrics.": "common feature",
  "Recovery monotonicity (quantified): compute the fraction of post‑trough samples that have nonnegative first differences after lowpass smoothing. Typical class‑0 has recovery monotonicity > ~80% on the smoothed curve; 60–80% is ambiguous; < ~60% favors class‑2.": "common feature",
  "Practical decision heuristics to disambiguate borderline samples (formalized): when the series matches the broad single‑cycle shape AND (a) post‑trough ripple amplitude < ~15% of peak–trough AND (b) plateau duration ≤ ~50 samples AND (c) recovery monotonicity > ~80% → favor class‑0. If descent length ≤ ~60–70 samples or ripple amplitude > ~25% or plateau duration ≥ ~100–120 samples → favor class‑2. If descent length is in the ambiguous interval (≈60–120 samples), then evaluate these four secondary metrics (ripple amplitude, curvature variance, plateau duration, recovery monotonicity): if ≥2 metrics favor class‑2 label class‑2; if ≥2 favor class‑0 label class‑0; otherwise mark as low‑confidence/inspect.": "common feature",
  "Replace rigid trough depth cutoff with combined rules: keep attention to troughs ≤ ~−1.9 but combine with plateau duration and descent rate. Example combined rule: if trough ≤ ~−1.9 AND plateau duration ≥75 samples → strong caution toward class‑2; if trough ≤ ~−1.9 but plateau duration is short and descent length ≳120 and ripple amplitude <15% → can still be class‑0.": "common feature",
  "Illustrative borderline examples and computed metrics (guidance for raters/models): Example A (ambiguous): descent interval 85 samples (ambiguous), ripple amplitude 18% (borderline), plateau 60 samples (borderline), recovery monotonicity 72% → borderline but leaning class‑0 if curvature variance is low; Example B (leans class‑2): descent interval 55 samples (sharp), ripple amplitude 28% (>25%), plateau 110 samples → favors class‑2; Example C (clear class‑0): descent interval 140 samples, ripple amplitude 8%, plateau 20 samples, recovery monotonicity 90% → favors class‑0.": "common feature",
  "In some series, only minor deviations from the common pattern appear: slightly deeper troughs near ~−1.9, modest short‑lived post‑trough ripples of amplitude up to ~15–25% of the peak–trough range, or a marginally faster descent. Such partial features reduce classification confidence and should be weighed against the common‑feature criteria above. Use the formalized metrics (descent length, ripple amplitude, plateau duration, curvature variance, recovery monotonicity) and the decision flow to resolve borderline cases rather than relying on a single cutoff.": "partial-sample feature"
