  "A single dominant low-frequency cycle in most series: a broad positive peak in the first third (≈200–300), a deep trough near the middle (≈450–550), then a monotonic recovery toward the end.": "common feature",
  "Very smooth, low-noise morphology with continuous inflection (no sharp spikes) in most series; transitions are gradual and rounded. Quantitatively, short-scale variability (local standard deviation computed in 5–15 step windows) is typically small — roughly ≤0.10–0.15 of the peak–trough amplitude.": "common feature",
  "Asymmetric shape in most series: relatively quicker rise and steeper descent into the trough, followed by a slower, steady recovery. Typical amplitude ranges: peak ≈ +1.3–1.6 and trough ≈ −1.5–−1.8 (peak–trough ≈ 3.0).": "common feature",
  "A relatively smooth curve with a clear trend: the post‑trough recovery is generally monotonic and free of sustained oscillatory patterns.": "common feature",
  "Rise and descent timing (quantified): rise to the main hump is typically gradual (≈100–220 steps); descent into the trough for class‑0 is typically spread and moderate (≈150–250 steps), i.e., per‑step negative slope is shallower than in series with a rapid drop.": "common feature",
  "Trough width and shape: troughs in most class‑0 examples are localized and rounded, with the minimum lasting a relatively short window (≈≤40–80 steps) rather than forming a broad flat plateau.": "common feature",
  "Post‑trough ripple / high‑frequency content rule: class‑0 examples typically show low post‑trough HF energy — any post‑trough oscillations usually have amplitude <10–20% of the peak–trough range and lack quasi‑regular spacing. Presence of small quasi‑regular ripples with amplitude ≈5–30% of the peak–trough suggests a different class.": "common feature",
  "Quantitative noise / smoothness discriminator: prefer class‑0 when short‑scale bandpass or local variance energy is substantially lower than the series’ low‑frequency energy (e.g., local std in 5–15 step windows ≲0.10–0.15×(peak–trough)). Higher short‑scale variance favors other classes.": "common feature",
  "Tie‑breaker (applies when timing and amplitude overlap with other classes): favor class‑2 when any of the following hold — descent into the trough occurs sharply (total descent duration ≲150 steps), the trough remains near its minimum for a longer window (trough width ≳80–100 steps), or post‑trough ripple amplitude >15% of the peak–trough. If these conditions are absent and the series matches the smooth, localized trough and low HF energy cues above, prefer class‑0.": "common feature",
  "End‑level behavior: class‑0 typically exhibits a smooth, monotonic recovery toward a small positive baseline with minimal oscillatory behavior near the series end; clear recovery undulations or sustained end‑segment oscillations favor other classes.": "common feature",
  "In some series, small deviations can appear: brief low‑amplitude bumps or dips (<5–10% of peak–trough) during the recovery, mild baseline tilt, or single isolated small spikes; these are usually short (≲10–30 steps) and do not disrupt the overall smooth, broad hump → trough → recovery contour.": "partial-sample feature",
  "In some series, faint quasi‑periodic ripples with amplitude near the lower bound (≈10–15% of peak–trough) may appear during recovery; when these ripples become larger or more regular they should reduce confidence in a class‑0 label.": "partial-sample feature"
