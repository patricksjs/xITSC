  "A single dominant low-frequency cycle: a broad positive peak in the first third (≈200–300), a deep trough near the middle (≈450–550), then a mostly monotonic recovery toward the end.": "common feature",
  "Very smooth, low-noise morphology with continuous, rounded inflection (no sharp spikes); transitions are gradual and rounded, showing low second-derivative variance.": "common feature",
  "Asymmetric shape: a relatively quicker rise and a moderate fall into the trough (the descent is typically smoother and less abrupt than in class‑2), followed by a slower, steady recovery; typical peak ≈ +1.3–1.6 and typical trough ≈ −1.5–−1.8 (peak–trough ≈ 3.0).": "common feature",
  "Trough timing, width and depth clarified: trough minimum most often occurs ≈ 450–550 and the deepest sustained minima in most series are within ≈ −1.5 to −1.8; when the trough exceeds ≈ −1.9 or remains near minimum for ≳120 time steps, treat the series with caution because it approaches class‑2 territory.": "common feature",
  "Descent and recovery rate cues: the main drop into the trough for class‑0 generally spans a broader window (≳120–200 steps) with gradual slope changes; very abrupt, large-magnitude negative slopes concentrated over 50–150 steps are more characteristic of class‑2.": "common feature",
  "Low high-frequency content and monotonic recovery: the post‑trough recovery in most series is largely monotonic and smooth with only very small ripples (typical ripple amplitude <≈15% of the peak–trough range); presence of pronounced quasi‑regular ripples during recovery favors other classes.": "common feature",
  "Spectral/curvature cue: prefer class‑0 when the series shows low spectral energy above mid frequencies and low variance of curvature (smoothed second-derivative), whereas distinct high‑frequency components or periodic ripples favor other classes.": "common feature",
  "Practical decision heuristics to disambiguate borderline samples: if the series matches the broad single‑cycle shape AND (a) post‑trough ripple amplitude <≈15% of the peak–trough range AND (b) trough depth ≤≈ −1.8 AND (c) recovery monotonicity >≈80% of the recovery window → favor class‑0. If instead the descent is very abrupt over 50–150 steps, the trough is deeply sustained (plateau) and/or recovery contains clear quasi‑regular ripples → consider other classes (e.g., class‑2).": "common feature",
  "In some series, only minor deviations from the common pattern appear: slightly deeper troughs near −1.9, modest short-lived post‑trough ripples of amplitude up to ≈15–20% of the peak–trough range, or a marginally faster descent; such partial features reduce classification confidence and should be weighed against the common‑feature criteria above.": "partial-sample feature"
