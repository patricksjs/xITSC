  "Two consistent broad pulses: a dominant early peak (~200–300) and a smaller secondary peak (~700–800), roughly half a period apart and differing substantially in amplitude.": "common feature",
  "Both pulses are smooth, bell‑shaped and approximately symmetric with gradual rise and fall, not sharp spikes.": "common feature",
  "The baseline between and outside pulses is negative and relatively flat, showing low‑amplitude slow oscillations rather than high‑frequency noise.": "common feature"
