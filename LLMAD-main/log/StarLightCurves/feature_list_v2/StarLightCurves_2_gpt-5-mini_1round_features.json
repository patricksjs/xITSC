  "Early‑mid pronounced hump: a clear local maximum typically between ~180–300 time steps (small oscillations may sit on a positive baseline); typical peak amplitudes are around +0.8 to +2.0 relative to baseline, and this hump consistently precedes the long decline.": "common feature",
  "Broad, smooth deep trough: a wide negative valley usually centered roughly between ~420–520 (can extend into ~400–600) with typical trough amplitudes around −1.2 to −2.0; trough width commonly spans ~100–250 steps with sustained negative values and relatively low high‑frequency content in many samples.": "common feature",
  "Asymmetric slope behavior: a relatively steep, rapid descent into the trough (larger negative first derivative concentrated over ~50–150 steps) followed by a slower, more gradual recovery over several hundred steps with small undulations returning toward zero/positive near the series end; the steeper descent vs. slower recovery is an important discriminator.": "common feature",
  "Consistent large‑scale biphasic contour: a broad positive hump peaking ~180–300, a rapid descent into a deep negative trough around ~420–520, then a slow recovery back toward small positive values at the series end; peak‑to‑trough differences commonly ≈2.0–3.5.": "common feature",
  "Superimposed low‑amplitude, quasi‑regular ripples: minor peaks/valleys often occur, becoming more evident after the trough with roughly constant spacing (period ≈60–150 steps) and modest amplitude (~0.05–0.4); these ripples are common but not universal—some series show only weak rippling.": "common feature",
  "Variability in noise and smoothness: many class‑2 examples contain moderate small oscillations and irregularities throughout (especially after the trough), while some examples are comparatively smooth and can visually resemble other classes; therefore overall smoothness alone should not be used as a binary rule.": "common feature",
  "Baseline offset and amplitude cues: typical baseline is near zero with a positive hump and negative trough as described; use absolute peak and trough values and the peak–trough delta (see ranges above) as quantitative aids when separating from similar classes.": "common feature",
  "Explicit discriminators vs class‑0: prefer features such as (a) presence of post‑trough quasi‑regular ripples with roughly constant spacing, (b) a measurably steeper initial descent into the trough (slope magnitude over ~50–150 steps), and (c) slightly higher variance after the trough; still expect overlap and some ambiguous, smooth class‑2 traces.": "common feature",
  "In some series: pronounced post‑trough rippling with larger amplitude (~0.2–0.4) and clearer periodicity.": "partial-sample feature",
  "In some series: additional small precursory bumps before the main hump or secondary shoulders during the recovery phase.": "partial-sample feature",
  "In some series: larger baseline offsets or overall amplitude scaling that places hump or trough amplitudes outside the typical ranges noted above.": "partial-sample feature",
  "In some series: elevated high‑frequency noise throughout, producing a much more fluctuating and irregular appearance.": "partial-sample feature"
