  "Early‑mid pronounced hump: in most series a clear local maximum typically centered ~180–300 time steps (early third of the series). Peak amplitude in many series is noticeably positive (commonly near +1.2–+1.8 relative to the local baseline), often with small superimposed oscillations riding on that positive baseline. Timing may shift by a few dozen time steps in some examples.": "common feature",
  "Broad, smooth deep trough: in most series a wide negative valley commonly centered ~420–520 time steps (middle of the series). Typical trough values in many examples fall near −1.6 to −2.0 relative to baseline. The trough frequently shows a plateau‑like bottom rather than a very sharp V; a useful plateau criterion is that the signal remains within ≈10% of the minimum for a sustained window of ≈50–150 time steps.": "common feature",
  "Asymmetric slope behavior (quantified): class‑2 typically shows a relatively steep, rapid descent into the trough and a slower recovery. Favor class‑2 when the main drop from local peak to trough occurs within ≤150 steps (stronger evidence if ≤100 steps) and when >50–70% of the peak→trough amplitude change happens inside a contiguous 50–150 step window. Recovery is typically slower and drawn out (often ≥250 steps to return toward baseline) and frequently exhibits small undulations.": "common feature",
  "A consistent large‑scale biphasic contour: in many series a broad positive hump peaking ~180–300, a rapid descent into a deep negative trough centered ~420–520, then a slow recovery back toward small positive values by the end. Typical peak→trough contrast in many series is pronounced (peak noticeably above baseline and trough noticeably below baseline) with timing and relative amplitudes within the ranges above.": "common feature",
  "Superimposed low‑amplitude, quasi‑regular ripples: minor peaks/valleys often present throughout but becoming more evident after the trough during recovery. These ripples commonly have amplitudes on the order of ~5–30% of the peak–trough range and rough spacing ~30–120 time steps. Treat post‑trough ripple amplitude >≈15% of the peak–trough range as supporting evidence for class‑2; weaker ripples (<≈15%) should be treated cautiously.": "common feature",
  "Variable small‑scale noise and irregularities: in some series there are more small oscillations and irregularities throughout, but the strength of these fluctuations varies. When ripples are weak and the recovery is largely monotonic (e.g., >≈80% of the recovery interval monotonic), class‑2 evidence from ripples is reduced and confusion with other classes is more likely.": "common feature",
  "Quantitative trough width and discriminants: the trough is often broad (the signal remains near its minimum for a sizable window—commonly ≈50–150 time steps), which helps distinguish this class from series with narrower dips. Favor class‑2 when (a) the descent is relatively abrupt (see descent rule above), (b) the trough shows a sustained plateau (≈50–150 steps within ≈10% of minimum), and/or (c) post‑trough ripples have sufficient normalized amplitude (>≈15%).": "common feature",
  "Curvature / spectral cues (explicit): class‑2 recovery often exhibits relatively higher mid‑frequency energy and greater second‑derivative variance than visually similar classes. A simple supporting metric is a raised ratio of spectral energy in periods ≈30–120 steps to total energy, or higher variance of a smoothed second derivative over the recovery interval; higher values favor class‑2.": "common feature",
  "Asymmetry / fall vs recovery rule‑of‑thumb: compare time from peak→trough to time from trough→return‑to‑baseline. Favor class‑2 when fall duration ≤150 steps (stronger if ≤100) and return‑to‑baseline duration ≥250 steps, particularly if recovery shows oscillations.": "common feature",
  "Trough depth nuance: very deep troughs (≈ ≤ −1.9 relative to baseline) provide strong support for class‑2. Moderate trough depths (~ −1.5 to −1.8) can be ambiguous and should be decided using descent speed, plateau length, and ripple metrics above.": "common feature",
  "Borderline decision rule: when features conflict (for example, moderate descent speed + shallow trough + low ripple amplitude), treat the sample as uncertain or preferentially classify as the visually smoother class (e.g., class‑0) unless plateau duration or ripple amplitude criteria for class‑2 are met. Use multiple metrics together rather than any single cue to decide.": "common feature",
  "Recommended diagnostic measurements to apply together (practical checklist): peak→trough time, contiguous plateau length around the minimum (samples within 10% of min), maximum negative mean slope over a 50‑step sliding window, post‑trough ripple RMS normalized by peak–trough amplitude, and mid‑frequency spectral energy ratio (periods ≈30–120). Combine these indicators rather than relying on a single threshold.": "common feature",
  "In some series there are timing variants such as slightly shifted hump timing (earlier or later by a few dozen time steps), reduced ripple amplitude (very weak oscillations), or extra small sub‑peaks on the rising flank. These partial variants do not form a uniform separate set of requirements but are observed in subsets of class‑2 examples.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Occasional reduced plateaus or shorter trough minima appear in some examples; when the contiguous minimum window is <≈30–40 steps the sample is less characteristic of class‑2 and other cues should be weighted more heavily.": "partial-sample feature",
  "In some series ripples may be concentrated earlier or later in the recovery; only ripples meeting the supporting amplitude/spacing thresholds (see above) should be used as strong evidence for class‑2.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Some class‑2 examples may be relatively noisy or relatively smooth; when the large‑scale biphasic shape (pronounced peak→trough contrast, steep descent and broad trough) is intact, classify as class‑2 even if small‑scale noise strength varies.": "partial-sample feature"
