  "Early-mid pronounced hump: a clear local maximum typically centered ~180–300 time steps (early third of the series). Peak amplitude in many series is noticeably positive (commonly near +1.2–+1.8 relative to the local baseline in typical examples), often with small superimposed oscillations riding on that positive baseline.": "common feature",
  "Broad, smooth deep trough: a wide negative valley commonly centered ~420–520 time steps (middle of the series). Typical trough values in many examples fall near −1.6 to −2.0 relative to baseline, and the trough shows reduced high‑frequency content (relatively smooth, sustained negative values rather than brief spikes).": "common feature",
  "Asymmetric slope behavior: a relatively steep, rapid descent into the trough (the main drop often occurs over ~50–150 time steps) followed by a slower, drawn‑out recovery spanning several hundred time steps; recovery frequently exhibits small undulations as it returns toward zero or slight positive values near the series end.": "common feature",
  "A consistent large‑scale biphasic contour: a broad positive hump peaking ~180–300, a rapid descent into a deep negative trough centered ~420–520, then a slow recovery back toward small positive values by the end. Typical peak→trough contrast in many series is pronounced (peak height noticeably above baseline and trough depth noticeably below baseline), with timing and relative amplitudes falling in the ranges above.": "common feature",
  "Superimposed low‑amplitude, quasi‑regular ripples: minor peaks/valleys often present throughout but becoming more evident after the trough during recovery. These ripples commonly have amplitudes on the order of ~5–30% of the peak–trough range and rough spacing on the order of ~30–120 time steps; their strength is variable from series to series.": "common feature",
  "Variable small‑scale noise and irregularities: in many series there are more small oscillations and irregularities throughout, but the strength of these fluctuations varies across examples. Some class‑2 series are relatively noisy with clear ripples, while other class‑2 series are comparatively smooth; when ripples are weak the large‑scale biphasic shape, steeper descent and broader trough become the more important distinguishing cues.": "common feature",
  "Quantitative trough width and discriminants: the trough is often broad (the signal remains near its minimum for a sizable window—commonly ~50–150 time steps), which helps distinguish this class from series with narrower dips. As a practical rule‑of‑thumb, favor class‑2 when a series shows (a) a notably sharper/steeper descent into the trough (large negative slope over ~50–150 steps), (b) a broad, sustained trough (remaining near the minimum for ~50–150 steps), and/or (c) low‑amplitude quasi‑regular ripples especially during recovery; if those features are weak or absent and the series is very smooth, confusion with other classes is more likely.": "common feature",
  "In some series there are no additional consistent partial‑sample‑only features; in other series occasional variants appear such as slightly shifted hump timing (earlier or later by a few dozen time steps), reduced ripple amplitude (very weak oscillations), or extra small sub‑peaks on the rising flank. These partial variants do not form a uniform separate set of requirements but are observed in subsets of class‑2 examples.": "partial-sample feature"
