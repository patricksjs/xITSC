  "Early-mid pronounced hump: a clear local maximum typically centered ~180–300 time steps (early third of the series). Peak amplitude in many series is noticeably positive (commonly near +1.2–+1.8 relative to the local baseline in typical examples), often with small superimposed oscillations riding on that positive baseline. Allow hump timing shifts of ±30 time steps when other class‑2 cues are present.": "common feature",
  "Broad, smooth deep trough: a wide negative valley commonly centered ~420–520 time steps (middle of the series). Typical trough values in many examples fall near −1.6 to −2.0 relative to baseline, and the trough shows reduced high‑frequency content (relatively smooth, sustained negative values rather than brief spikes). Operational trough width guidance (see separate bullet) should be used to distinguish plateau‑like troughs from narrow minima.": "common feature",
  "Asymmetric slope behavior: a relatively steep, rapid descent into the trough (the main drop often occurs over ~50–150 time steps) followed by a slower, drawn‑out recovery spanning several hundred time steps; recovery frequently exhibits small undulations as it returns toward zero or slight positive values near the series end. To reduce ambiguity with neighboring classes, quantify the descent as described below rather than relying only on qualitative impressions.": "common feature",
  "A consistent large‑scale biphasic contour: a broad positive hump peaking ~180–300, a rapid descent into a deep negative trough centered ~420–520, then a slow recovery back toward small positive values by the end. Typical peak→trough contrast in many series is pronounced (peak height noticeably above baseline and trough depth noticeably below baseline), with timing and relative amplitudes falling in the ranges above.": "common feature",
  "Superimposed low‑amplitude, quasi‑regular ripples: minor peaks/valleys often present throughout but becoming more evident after the trough during recovery. These ripples commonly have amplitudes on the order of ~5–30% of the peak–trough range and rough spacing on the order of ~30–120 time steps; their strength is variable from series to series. Use the ripple metrics below to quantify this feature.": "common feature",
  "Variable small‑scale noise and irregularities: in many series there are more small oscillations and irregularities throughout, but the strength of these fluctuations varies across examples. Some class‑2 series are relatively noisy with clear ripples, while other class‑2 series are comparatively smooth; when ripples are weak the large‑scale biphasic shape, steeper descent and broader trough become the more important distinguishing cues.": "common feature",
  "Quantitative trough width and discriminants: the trough is often broad (the signal remains near its minimum for a sizable window—commonly ~50–150 time steps), which helps distinguish this class from series with narrower dips. As a practical rule‑of‑thumb, favor class‑2 when a series shows (a) a notably sharper/steeper descent into the trough (large negative slope over ~50–150 steps), (b) a broad, sustained trough (remaining near the minimum for ~50–150 steps), and/or (c) low‑amplitude quasi‑regular ripples especially during recovery; if those features are weak or absent and the series is very smooth, confusion with other classes is more likely.": "common feature",
  "Explicit slope/descent metric (added): compute peak→trough amplitude A = peak_value − trough_value. Label the descent as “concentrated/steep” if at least 60% of A (≥0.6·A) occurs within a 50–150 step window from the hump toward the trough, and the maximum negative first derivative over that window is within the bottom 10th percentile of negative slopes for the dataset. If the main drop is spread over >150 steps or <50% of A occurs in 150 steps, increase likelihood of the series belonging to another class.": "common feature",
  "Operational trough width definition (added): define trough_width as the length of the longest contiguous window where the series remains below (trough_value + 0.1·A) (i.e., within 10% of the trough depth). Prefer class‑2 when trough_width ≥50 steps (typical 50–150). If trough_width <40 steps treat the trough as relatively narrow and reduce class‑2 confidence.": "common feature",
  "Plateau vs point‑min discriminator (added): flag as class‑2 when the trough shows a “flat‑bottom” characteristic: low variance of the second derivative inside the trough window (e.g., below a dataset percentile such as the 40th). A sharp, high‑curvature single minimum should reduce class‑2 confidence and encourage comparison with classes characterized by point minima.": "common feature",
  "Ripple strength and spectral cues (added): quantify ripples as ripple_RMS computed on the post‑trough recovery window and express relative ripple strength as ripple_RMS / A. Prefer class‑2 when ripple_RMS ≥ 0.08·A and when there is notable spectral energy in mid frequencies corresponding to periods ~30–120 steps. If ripple_RMS < 0.05·A and the recovery is monotonic for ≥80% of the post‑trough window, favor an alternate class.": "common feature",
  "Explicit decision heuristic for borderline samples (added): (a) if descent duration >150 steps OR less than 50% of A occurs within 150 steps → bias toward alternate classes (e.g., class‑0); (b) if descent is concentrated in 50–150 steps, trough_width ≥50 steps AND trough_value ≤ baseline −1.6 (or trough_depth ≥1.6 when baseline normalized) → bias toward class‑2; (c) use ripple_RMS/A and mid‑frequency spectral energy to break ties (higher ripple energy increases class‑2 likelihood); (d) when timing of hump or trough shifts slightly (within ±30–40 steps), require supporting slope and trough_width metrics to assert class‑2.": "common feature",
  "Recommended computed features for labelers/classifiers (added): compute and use these: peak_value, trough_value, A (peak→trough), descent_duration (number of steps between 80% and 20% of peak→trough), max_negative_slope, slope_concentration (fraction of A occurring within the steepest 50–150 step window), trough_width (as defined above), ripple_RMS / A, mid‑freq spectral energy ratio (periods 30–120). Apply the decision heuristic above to these features for consistent labeling.": "common feature",
  "Clarifications and tolerances (added): restate hump center as ~180–300±30 steps and trough center ~420–520±40 steps; slight phase shifts are acceptable when slope, trough width and ripple metrics support class‑2 assignment. Favor measurable discriminants (slope concentration, trough_width, ripple_RMS/A) over qualitative judgment when signals are borderline.": "common feature",
  "In some series there are no additional consistent partial‑sample‑only features; in other series occasional variants appear such as slightly shifted hump timing (earlier or later by a few dozen time steps), reduced ripple amplitude (very weak oscillations), or extra small sub‑peaks on the rising flank. These partial variants do not form a uniform separate set of requirements but are observed in subsets of class‑2 examples.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Partial variants and soft rules (added): when hump timing shifts by ~30–40 steps or ripple amplitude is reduced below 0.05·A, require stronger evidence from slope_concentration and trough_width to retain a class‑2 label. In some series sub‑peaks on the rising flank or modest baseline wander appear; these are tolerated when the large‑scale biphasic contour, descent concentration and sustained trough remain consistent with class‑2.": "partial-sample feature"
