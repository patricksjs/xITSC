  "Early-mid pronounced hump: a clear local maximum typically centered ~180–300 time steps (early third of the series); treat 160–320 as a soft allowance. Typical peak amplitude sits ~+1.0–+1.8 above a local baseline (allow down to ~+0.8 in noisy or weak-peaked examples). The hump can show small superimposed oscillations riding on that positive baseline.": "common feature",
  "Broad, smooth deep trough: a wide negative valley commonly centered ~420–520 time steps; accept ~400–560 as a soft range. Typical trough minima in many examples fall near −1.6 to −2.0 relative to the same baseline; treat troughs in the −1.2 to −1.6 range as borderline where other features should be weighted more heavily.": "common feature",
  "Asymmetric slope behavior: a relatively steep, rapid descent into the trough followed by a slower, drawn‑out recovery. Quantify steep descent by Δ/L where Δ = (peak value − trough minimum) and L = number of steps from peak to trough; prefer class‑2 when Δ/L ≳ 0.008–0.02 units/step (descent concentrated over ~50–150 steps). If Δ/L < ~0.008 (decline spread over ≳150–200 steps), down‑weight the class‑2 decision unless other class‑2 cues are strong.": "common feature",
  "A consistent large‑scale biphasic contour: the sequence of a broad positive hump peaking ~180–300, a relatively rapid descent into a deep negative trough centered ~420–520, then a slow recovery back toward small positive or near‑zero values by the series end. Emphasize peak→trough contrast as a discriminator (see peak–trough delta rule below).": "common feature",
  "Superimposed low‑amplitude, quasi‑regular ripples: minor peaks/valleys are often present throughout and commonly become more evident during recovery. Typical ripple amplitudes are ~5–30% of the peak–trough range and rough spacing ~30–120 steps. If post‑trough ripple amplitude is ≥~10% and shows quasi‑regular spacing, this supports class‑2; weak or absent ripples do not rule out class‑2 when other large‑scale cues match.": "common feature",
  "Variable small‑scale noise and irregularities: many series include small oscillations of variable strength. Some class‑2 examples are comparatively noisy; others are comparatively smooth. When ripples are weak, rely more on timing, descent steepness, trough width and peak–trough contrast.": "common feature",
  "Quantitative trough width and discriminants: measure trough width as the count of consecutive steps for which the signal remains within 10% of the trough minimum relative to the peak–trough range. Class‑2 favors widths ≈50–150 steps by this definition; widths <50 steps indicate a narrower dip less typical of class‑2.": "common feature",
  "Peak→trough contrast (delta) guidance: define delta = peak value − trough minimum. Prefer class‑2 when delta ≳ 2.6 (typical) or when delta ≳ 2.0 combined with steep descent (Δ/L threshold) or broad trough width. If delta < ~2.0 and descent is gradual, favor class‑0.": "common feature",
  "Quantify recovery monotonicity and ripple energy: define recovery window from trough center to end (or to where signal returns near baseline). Compute the fraction of steps that increase relative to the previous step; class‑2 recoveries often show <~80% monotonic increases and measurable ripple energy. If recovery monotonicity >~80% and ripple amplitude <~10–15% of the peak–trough range, down‑weight class‑2 unless other strong cues hold.": "common feature",
  "Tie‑breaking heuristic combining cues: label as strong class‑2 when (a) steepness Δ/L ≥ ~0.008 AND (b) trough width ≥50 AND (c) (delta ≥2.0 OR ripple amplitude ≥10%). For borderline cases (one strong cue missing), require at least two supporting cues among {steepness, width, delta ≥2.0, ripple amplitude ≥10%}. If none hold and the drop is broad (Δ/L ≲0.008–0.005) with monotonic recovery and very low ripple energy, favor class‑0.": "common feature",
  "Spectral and curvature guidance: when available, prefer class‑2 if the mid‑to‑high frequency spectral energy (relative to low frequency) is higher than typical class‑0 examples, or if smoothed second‑derivative variance over recovery is elevated; prefer class‑0 when spectral energy is concentrated at low frequencies and curvature variance is very small.": "common feature",
  "In some series there are timing variants: the hump or trough can be shifted earlier or later by a few dozen time steps (hump timing sometimes ~160–180 or up to ~320; trough timing sometimes ~400–560). These shifts are compatible with class‑2 when other large‑scale features persist.": "partial-sample feature",
  "In some series ripple amplitude or regularity is reduced: very weak oscillations may be present or absent; treat ripple absence as a non‑disqualifying condition if descent steepness, trough width, and timing match class‑2.": "partial-sample feature",
  "In some series extra small sub‑peaks appear on the rising flank or on the recovery; these local features do not override the large‑scale biphasic contour if timing, descent and trough width are consistent with class‑2.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Borderline depth variants: examples with troughs in the −1.2 to −1.6 range should be treated as partial/borderline class‑2 and require additional supporting cues (steep Δ/L, broad trough width, delta ≥2.0, or measurable ripples) to be assigned to class‑2 rather than class‑0.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Occasional reduced‑steepness variants: some class‑2 members show a more gradual decline (descent length ≳150–200 steps); when that occurs, require stronger evidence from trough width, peak–trough delta, or ripple energy to retain a class‑2 label.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Noise/irregularity variants: in some class‑2 examples small‑scale noise or irregularities are stronger, in others weaker; use the quantitative criteria above (Δ/L, width, delta, ripple amplitude, recovery monotonicity) to resolve ambiguous cases rather than relying on ripple presence alone.": "partial-sample feature"
