  "A mid-sequence level change from a negative baseline to a higher positive plateau: in many series this is implemented as a monotonic S-shaped ramp lasting ~15–30 timesteps (appearing abrupt relative to the long quiet sections but not necessarily a single-sample jump), typically centered roughly between time steps ~60–90.": "common feature",
  "The level increase magnitude is commonly large — typically about ~1.8–2.5 units from baseline to steady plateau (consider threshold > ~1.6 units to flag a substantive step change); this amplitude helps distinguish level-change events from small drifting signals.": "common feature",
  "Long, relatively stable plateau after the transition: the series remains near the new mean with low variance and only small fluctuations for much of the remainder.": "common feature",
  "Low-amplitude high-frequency noise superimposed on both baseline and plateau, producing small jitter but preserving clear level segments.": "common feature",
  "Late, localized biphasic transient when present: often a narrow positive spike (single to a few timesteps) followed quickly by a short undershoot; the undershoot magnitude is variable and frequently small (often < ~0.5 units) or may merely return toward the plateau rather than producing a large negative trough.": "common feature",
  "Timing and amplitude notes: the step-up commonly occurs near ~60–90 timesteps and a late spike/undershoot, when present, commonly appears near ~160–190 timesteps; both timing and magnitudes can vary across examples.": "common feature",
  "Distinguishing cues versus similar classes: prefer this class if a distinct narrow post-plateau spike (sharp, short-duration positive peak) and/or a small asymmetric undershoot follows the ramp; prefer alternative classes if the mid-sequence rise is an extended, very smooth sigmoid with no localized narrow spikes later and if post-rise behavior shows strictly two long, featureless low-variance plateaus with no localized transients.": "common feature",
  "Suggested numeric thresholds for automated decisions (use as guidance, not absolute rules): ramp duration ~15–30 timesteps, step amplitude > ~1.6–1.8 units, and late-transient peak-to-undershoot difference > ~0.4 units.": "common feature",
  "The step-up and any later spike/undershoot tend to occur in consistent windows across examples (step ~60–90, spike/undershoot ~160–190), but either feature can be reduced in amplitude, temporally shifted, or absent in some series.": "partial-sample feature",
  "The mid-sequence rise may appear as a smooth, monotonic S-shaped ramp in some examples rather than an instantaneous jump; such a multi-timestep ramp (15–30 timesteps) can still be interpreted as the characteristic rapid level change for this class.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Variability of the late transient across examples: in some series the undershoot after the spike is pronounced, in others it is small or not clearly distinguishable; a pronounced negative dip should not be required for class membership.": "partial-sample feature",
  "Plateau statistics can be informative in some samples: pre- and post-change plateau means and their difference are often large (on the order of ~2 units) and plateaus typically show lower variance than transition segments.": "partial-sample feature"
