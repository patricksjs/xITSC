Global outline: The candidate series displays two well-defined lobes, one peaking around t\u224870 (~+1.16) and the other around t\u2248180 (~+1.12), separated by a deep trough (t\u2248110\u2013130 at ~\u20131.4).  This clear bimodal structure closely matches the dual lobes seen in both Class 1 and Class 0, but the amplitudes (~1.1\u20131.2) are lower than the ~1.5 typical for Class 0.\\n\\n2. Plateaued apexes: Each major lobe in the new series has a broad, flattened top lasting on the order of 10\u201315 steps, exactly as described for Class 1 (\u201cflattened apex lasting ~8\u201312 steps\u201d).  Class 2 shoulders are usually shorter (5\u201310), and Class 0 lobes are sharper.\\n\\n3. Skewness of peaks: The ascent into each peak is slightly less steep than the descent (a longer trailing slope), consistent with the slight right-skew described for Class 1 (\u201cclimb up steeper than descent\u201d).  Class 2 actually requires the opposite inversion on the first hump.\\n\\n4. Central trough micro-features: The trough is fairly flat for ~5\u201310 steps in the \u20131.3 to \u20131.5 range, similar to the small plateau/inflection seen in the central valley of Class 1 samples.  Class 0 shows only very minor inflections (~0.1\u20130.2 amplitude) around 120\u2013130, and Class 2 has a deeper, more V-shaped trough with no central plateau.\\n\\n5. Baseline closure: The series begins and ends at nearly identical baseline values (within ~0.05), a hallmark of Class 1 contours.\\n\\n6. Comparison to nearest neighbors: The three most similar samples (two from Class 1 and one from Class 2) visually align far better with the Class 1 examples (Index 10 and 16) in terms of lobe height, plateau width, trough depth, and overall symmetry.  Although the Class 2 neighbor (Index 32) shares the two-humped structure, its shoulders are noticeably shorter and its slope inversion pattern differs.\\n\\nPreliminary prediction of Class 1 is therefore reinforced by multiple matching characteristics (bimodal peaks at ~1.1, broad plateaued apexes, right-skew, trough plateau, baseline closure) that are not jointly exhibited by Class 0 or Class 2.  No other class better explains all observed features, so the final decision is Class 1.\"\n}",
