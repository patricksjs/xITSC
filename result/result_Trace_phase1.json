        "Early stable baseline (Sample 0, Sample 4, Sample 15, Sample 93) - occurrence: roughly t=0..45 (varies sample-to-sample). Manifestation: low-amplitude, slowly-varying positive level around +0.5 (small Gaussian jitter). Time-frequency: very low energy concentrated at the 0Hz row and adjacent lowest-frequency rows. Heatmap mapping: predominantly weak-to-moderate red in the lowest frequency rows around the early window in most samples (indicating the model views this stable offset as a typical baseline feature). Interpretation: typical feature (red at 0Hz row), with only scattered blue pixels in higher adjacent frequencies (minor atypical contributions).",
        "Short-duration positive impulse / spike (Sample 0: t\u224855-62; Sample 4: t\u224860-68; Sample 15: t\u224895-102; Sample 93: t\u2248100-108) - occurrence: narrow time window. Manifestation: very sharp, large positive peak with amplitude up to \u2248 +3.5\u2013+4.0 above baseline (fast rise then immediate fall). Time-frequency: a concentrated high-energy patch appearing in the lowest frequency rows and spilling slightly into adjacent low-frequency rows; sometimes a narrow spread to intermediate frequencies if any jitter present. Heatmap mapping: strong red concentrated at the 0Hz row and adjacent low-frequency rows for the spike time window (consistent across samples) \u2192 classified as a typical, discriminative feature by the model. Some sparse blue pixels sometimes appear in higher frequency rows at the same time window (minor atypical components), but red dominates.",
        "Immediate deep negative valley following the spike (Sample 0: t\u224862-90; Sample 4: t\u224870-95; Sample 15: t\u2248102-130; Sample 93: t\u2248110-140) - occurrence: immediately after the spike and lasting tens of time steps. Manifestation: abrupt drop to a deep negative plateau, typical valley amplitude \u2248 -1.8 to -2.2, with small high-frequency micro-oscillations on top. Time-frequency: strong energy again concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows during the valley (reflecting large DC/low-frequency deviation) and some low-to-intermediate frequency energy from micro-oscillations. Heatmap mapping: predominantly red at the low-frequency rows during valley windows (model considers the valley a typical label feature). Occasional blue pixels in mid-frequency rows overlay the valley region in some samples (indicating that those particular frequency components are less typical or confuse the model), but the low-frequency red presence dominates \u2192 valley treated as typical overall.",
        "Sustained negative plateau / slow oscillatory negative morphology (Sample 0, 4, 15, 93) - occurrence: roughly the immediate post-valley interval spanning ~t\u224870..140 (sample-specific). Manifestation: low-frequency negative plateau near -2 with gentle (low-amplitude) slow oscillation and modest volatility (small random fluctuations). Time-frequency: continued energy in the very-low-frequency rows (0Hz and adjacent); slightly more energy spread into a band of low/mid-low frequency rows representing the slow oscillation. Heatmap mapping: mixture of red and scattered blue in these low-to-mid frequency rows during the plateau. In many samples low-frequency cells remain red (typical), while some intermediate rows show blue (indicative that certain oscillatory components in the plateau are ambiguous/atypical). Overall classification: mostly typical for the DC-like negative deviation, but with ambiguous mid-frequency components.",

Manifestation: monotonic slow increase from the negative plateau back to near-zero and beyond, crossing y=0 in mid-to-late window and asymptoting toward the initial positive baseline (~+0.5). Morphology: sigmoid-like ramp with modest jitter. Time-frequency: energy concentrated at the lowest frequencies (trend) plus light mid-frequency energy where jitter/small oscillations occur. Heatmap mapping: mixed coloring \u2014 low-frequency trend cells sometimes red (model sees the overall ramp as typical), but many adjacent cells (especially where oscillatory components appear) are blue or mixed \u2192 model confusion or atypical contributions in those mid-frequency bands. Thus the trend's DC component is more typical while its oscillatory components are more ambiguous/atypical.",
        "Late-stage stable return to baseline (Sample 0, 4, 15, 93) - occurrence: roughly t\u2248190..275. Manifestation: re-established positive baseline around +0.4..+0.6 with low volatility, similar to the start but slightly noisier. Time-frequency: low energy concentrated at 0Hz row and minimal upper-frequency energy. Heatmap mapping: generally neutral-to-mild red in lowest frequency rows (weak typical) and scattered light-blue pixels in higher rows (minor atypical frequency contributions). Classified as largely typical (baseline recovery), though the model assigns weaker importance here compared to the spike/valley windows.",
        "Low-amplitude jitter / small high-frequency fluctuations superposed on plateau and recovery (all samples) - occurrence: throughout plateau and recovery phases. Manifestation: small, higher-frequency oscillations (visible as mild roughness). Time-frequency: higher relative energy at adjacent mid-frequency rows (not the 0Hz row) during windows where jitter is visible. Heatmap mapping: these mid-frequency cells are often blue or mixed (model considers these components atypical or confusing relative to the label). Classification: atypical features (blue) or ambiguous when mixed with low-frequency red.",
        "Time-frequency concentration pattern (summary) - across samples the dominant T-F signature of the label is strong, concentrated low-frequency (0Hz row + adjacent lower rows) energy localized at the spike and valley time windows. Heatmap mapping: these concentrated low-frequency cells are repeatedly red (typical), which means the model relies on large low-frequency deviations (sharp spike + deep valley) as main label indicators. Adjacent higher-frequency spread, when present, is often blue/ambiguous."

STFT: high energy concentrated at the 0 Hz row (DC / very-low-frequency) with some energy leaking into the immediately adjacent low-frequency rows. Heatmap mapping: the DC row at the spike window is strongly red (typical), but critically there is a localized, strong blue signature in the adjacent low-but-nonzero-frequency rows (appearing as a deep blue cell centered near the spike time and a small frequency above 0 Hz). Interpretation: the impulsive spike has two distinct frequency-contributions in the model\u2019s view \u2014 a DC/very-low-frequency part that is typical for label 0 (red), and a small but pronounced adjacent low-frequency component that is atypical (blue).

        "Confirmation that preliminary summary covers the main events, followed by a detailed, stepwise feature extraction and mapping to heatmap/STFT/plot for Sample 52: \n\nOverview & baseline (t \u2248 0\u2013110): The trace begins with a stable positive baseline around +0.6 to +0.9 with only small amplitude jitter. In the STFT this corresponds to concentrated energy at the lowest frequency row (0 Hz) and negligible higher-frequency content. The SHAP heatmap shows mostly pale-red cells in the 0 Hz row during this early window, indicating that the model treats the early positive baseline as weakly supportive (typical but low evidence) for the target label. Manifestation: stable amplitude, low variance, typical (red/pale-red) at 0 Hz.\n\nAbrupt negative step / valley onset (t \u2248 110\u2013130): A very sharp, large-magnitude drop occurs (~2.5\u20133.0 units drop from ~+0.8 down to \u2248 -2.0). In the STFT this time window shows a concentrated high-energy patch strongly localized in the 0 Hz row and the adjacent lowest-frequency bins (clear high magnitude centered around the step). The SHAP heatmap shows strong red in the lowest-frequency row (and some red in adjacent low-frequency rows) aligned with the step time-slices. Interpretation: this valley/step is a canonical, strongly-typical feature for the true label (model uses it as primary supporting evidence). Manifestation: very steep slope, large magnitude trough bottom, typical (red) at 0 Hz and immediate neighbors.\n\nSustained deep trough / mid-phase (t \u2248 125\u2013165): After the step the signal settles into a prolonged negative trough around -2.0 to -1.7 with low-amplitude jitter. The STFT maintains strong low-frequency energy over an extended time (still concentrated near 0 Hz but slightly extended in time support). SHAP here remains predominantly red in the lowest-frequency rows but with some mixed/neutral cells \u2014 overall mostly-typical but with slight ambiguity. Manifestation: stable negative baseline, low variance; typical/mostly-typical (red with minor mixed cells) at low freq.\n\nGradual recovery ramp / late-phase (t \u2248 165\u2013275): The trace exhibits a slow, monotonic recovery from the trough back to positive values, crossing y=0 about t \u2248 220\u2013235 and ending near the original baseline (~+0.6\u20130.8). STFT energy during this ramp is still concentrated at low frequencies but spreads into adjacent low-to-mid frequency bins because the change is slow (long time support \u2192 low-mid frequency content). The SHAP heatmap shows mixed-to-blue markings in the low\u2013mid frequency rows during this interval \u2014 patches of blue indicating the model treats parts of the recovery ramp as atypical for the true label. Manifestation: long-duration trend/recovery, low instantaneous frequency but broader low-mid frequency footprint; atypical (blue/mixed) in low-mid frequency rows.\n\nEdge-region higher-frequency spread (around the step edges, t \u2248 100\u2013150): The abruptness of the step produces brief higher-frequency energy localized around the edges in the STFT. The SHAP map shows scattered small blue and pale-red cells in higher-frequency rows near the step, indicating ambiguity/noise in how those high-frequency components are interpreted (they slightly modulate classification but are weaker than the 0 Hz pattern). Manifestation: short-duration HF content adjacent to step; ambiguous (mixed small red/blue) in higher-frequency rows.\n\nSmall high-frequency jitters (throughout): Low-amplitude high-frequency jitter is visible across the trace (especially on baseline and trough edges). STFT shows weak HF energy spread; SHAP indicates small scattered blue/pale-red spots in HF rows. These are low-impact but contribute to model uncertainty when combined with competing evidence. Manifestation: small-amplitude HF oscillations; ambiguous/low influence (mixed blue/pale-red)."

        "Overall reflection on why these patterns cause misclassification: In all three samples the dominant, strongly-typical event for label 1 is the abrupt large negative step and the deep trough (clear red at the 0Hz row in heatmaps and high energy in the STFT low-frequency band). However, each sample also contains a prolonged recovery/trend (slow ramp back to baseline) whose frequency signature spreads into low-mid frequency bins and is marked as mixed or blue in the heatmaps. That atypical recovery pattern reduces the net support for label 1 and introduces evidence toward another class, producing a small logit margin and therefore misclassification. Thus, boundary samples are produced by the co-occurrence of a strong typical valley event plus an extended/atypical recovery trend that the model treats as conflicting evidence.",

        "Detailed analysis and justification that the preliminary summary already covers the boundary-causing features for Sample 2 (long-form explanation):\n\nOverview and mapping of visible events\n- Baseline (early stage, time ~0\u201360): The trace shows a persistent, steady negative offset around -2.0 to -2.2 in the first ~50\u201360 time steps with very low short-term volatility. This corresponds to strong DC content in the STFT (0 Hz row) and the SHAP heatmap shows consistent red contributions in the lowest-frequency rows during the early window. The baseline magnitude and stability are therefore treated by the model as a characteristic (typical) feature for the label. \n\n- Steep rising edge / step change (early\u2192mid stage, time ~60\u201380): There is a relatively rapid, large-amplitude step from the negative baseline up to a positive plateau (~+0.45\u2013+0.6). The slope happens over a few tens of time steps (visible sharp slope in the waveform), producing concentrated energy at the DC/lowest-frequency rows in the STFT. The SHAP heatmap shows red at those low-frequency time bins for this transition, indicating the model interprets that DC-level step as a typical class feature. The plateau after the step is fairly stable, again dominated by low-frequency energy and interpreted as typical.\n\n- Middle/late positive transient spike (time ~150\u2013165): A short-lived positive spike rises above the plateau (amplitude roughly +0.3\u2013+0.5 relative to the plateau, absolute ~0.9\u20131.0 at the peak). In the STFT this appears as a local low-frequency energy increase, but noticeably less concentrated than the step (the spike is briefer). In the SHAP heatmap, the time-frequency cells around the spike show mixed coloration: some low-frequency bins are red while adjacent low- and mid-frequency bins show neutral-to-blue values. This indicates the model is uncertain about whether components of the spike are typical or atypical for the label.\n\n- Immediate following sharp valley / trough (time ~165\u2013180): Immediately after the spike there is a deep, fast negative trough that approaches or reaches the y=0 reference (relative drop ~-0.4 to -0.6 from plateau). The STFT shows localized energy here but with slightly different spectral spread (the abrupt polarity change creates energy in neighboring low-frequency rows). In the SHAP heatmap those late-time low-frequency bins are mixed with a substantial amount of blue (atypical) marking\u2014especially at some DC-adjacent rows and some neighboring time bins. This suggests the trough contains features the model associates more with other labels (not the canonical label-2 signature).\n\n- Low-amplitude jitter / higher-frequency spread (around transitions and spike/trough): Small oscillations are visible on the plateau and superimposed on the spike/trough which create weak energy in adjacent higher-frequency STFT rows. The SHAP heatmap marks many of these higher-frequency components as neutral/blue (atypical), further contributing to ambiguity.\n\nWhy this becomes a boundary sample (relation to logits)\n- The model logits show competing support: class-2 has positive logit (~+1.78) but class-3 is higher (~+2.21). The SHAP evidence explains this: early baseline + DC step are strongly characteristic of class-2 (red in the DC heatmap cells) and pull the model toward class-2. However, the late spike+trough region has mixed/blue SHAP contributions in the relevant low-frequency rows (and some blue in adjacent frequency rows due to jitter). The trough portion in particular has properties (timing, polarity and spectral spread) that resemble class-3-like patterns in the training data, so the late atypical region counteracts the early typical evidence and tips the net score toward class-3.\n\nWhich specific features are the classification-boundary drivers\n- The spike+immediate trough pair is the decisive ambiguous pattern. Its polarity reversal, peak/trough amplitudes and short duration produce spectral content that is mixed in the SHAP map (red + blue) \u2014 this overlap is exactly what moves the trace across the decision boundary.\n- Secondary driver: small high-frequency jitter during the transient spreads energy into frequency rows that the model marks blue, increasing ambiguity.\n\nConclusion on preliminary summary coverage\n- The provided preliminary feature summary already lists the baseline, the steep rising step, the late positive spike, the immediate valley and the localized jitter/high-frequency spread \u2014 and it notes that the spike/trough is ambiguous and causes confusion. All material boundary-causing features observed in the plot, STFT and SHAP heatmap for Sample 2 are included in that summary. Therefore there are no additional missing features or novel patterns to add beyond what is already documented in the preliminary summary."
