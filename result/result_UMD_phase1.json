Interpretation: absence of a distinct isolated small early upward peak (i.e., the canonical label-0 feature) \u2014 this absence is an atypical feature for label-0 (heatmap lacks decisive red in early low-frequency cells).

SHAP heatmap: strong red concentrated at the 0Hz (lowest) frequency row across ~54\u2013108 (peak red intensity around ~75\u201395) and weaker red continuing until the plateau end.

        "Why this pattern is a classification boundary: The model has learned that small, smooth, localized low-frequency bumps near the sequence ends are characteristic of label-0. Here, those localized bumps are missing and replaced by a long, high-amplitude, low-frequency plateau that matches the class-1 spectral template (strong 0Hz energy). The combination (missing label-0 transient + strongly class-1-typical plateau) creates a boundary sample: if the plateau were shorter or if a clear early/late small peak existed, the model might prefer label-0; instead the plateau yields high positive SHAP mass for class-1 and produces the misclassification. The small transient signatures (descent and slight higher-frequency components at the end) are too weak and in some frequency bins are marked blue, so they do not counteract the plateau evidence."

Heatmap color = mixed: this time region shows pronounced blue (negative SHAP) in the earlier part of the plateau (approx. 45\u201375 at 0Hz / low-freq rows) and localized red patches toward the tail/exit of the plateau (approx. 75\u201395 region at 0Hz/lowest-frequency rows). Interpretation = the sustained peak is atypical for label 1 (label 1 expects no peaks); the plateau's presence produces strong low-frequency energy that the model marks as atypical (blue) in its central portion. This plateau is a major atypical feature that pushes the model away from classifying the sample as label 1.",
        "Abrupt downward transition / final trough-like return to baseline (time steps ~79-86): type = valley / downward transition (short-term trough relative to prior plateau). Manifestation = a fast negative excursion from ~2.5 down to ~0 within a few steps (large negative rate of change; amplitude change ~-2.4 over ~3\u20137 steps). Morphology = sharp drop and short tail to near-zero baseline; in time-domain it appears as a final downward trough-like event. Frequency mapping = localized concentrated energy in low-frequency row (0Hz) during the transition and some broader low-adjacent-frequency energy due to the abruptness; STFT shows energy across adjacent low-frequency rows during the descent. Heatmap color = strong red in the low-frequency rows for this final period (~80\u201395) indicating positive SHAP (features here are being treated as more supportive for the label being summarized). Interpretation = this sharp downward transition is interpreted by the model as a distinctive event; because label definitions state \u201csmall downward trough appears in the initial or final period\u201d for label 2, the abrupt descent at the end resembles a Down-class signature. The heatmap shows the final descent region as red (typical for the summarized label), but given the heatmap is computed relative to label 1 context it indicates this local energy contributes toward the model's current internal scoring (mixed effect).

Heatmap & frequency mapping interpretation: the plateau produces a large low-frequency (0Hz and nearby) energy band seen in STFT; its mid-portion is marked blue in the SHAP heatmap (atypical for label 1) and hence contributes to lowering confidence in label 1. The abrupt descent at the end produces concentrated low-frequency energy at the transition and is associated with red SHAP cells in the immediate post-descent region; because label 2 is defined by a small downward trough at initial or final periods, that abrupt downward signature is strongly boundary-resembling and contributes to increasing the model's score for label 2. Why misclassification occurred: the combination of a large, atypical mid-sequence plateau (contradicting the 'no-peak' expectation of label 1) plus a sharp final downward transition (mimicking a Down-class trough in the final period) creates conflicting spectral/SHAP signals. The model's logits show label 2 slightly higher than label 1 (1.0607 vs. 0.8577), indicating that the atypical plateau (blue SHAP influence) together with distinctive downward-edge features have pushed the score marginally towards label 2. Conclusion: boundary-driving features are (1) extended mid-sequence plateau/large positive deviation (atypical for label 1; strong low-frequency energy; blue in SHAP) and (2) abrupt final downward transition/trough (valley-like in final period; spectral signature in low-frequency rows; interpreted by model as Down-like).

        "Detailed analysis and confirmation that the preliminary summary already covers the relevant misclassification-driving features and patterns for Sample 63 (predicted label 2, logits = [-0.1473, 0.8577, 1.0607]). Stepwise evidence and mapping: \n\n1) Time-domain morphology and quantitative description: The time series clearly splits into four practical stages: (a) Early baseline (time steps 0\u201344) \u2014 low-amplitude near-zero noise with values roughly between -0.05 and +0.15 and no sustained drift; (b) Abrupt rise and sustained plateau (approx. 45\u201380) \u2014 a steep climb starting ~45\u201353 reaching a stable high plateau around 2.4\u20132.6 where the amplitude delta relative to baseline is about +2.4\u20132.6; the plateau remains very stable (low intra-plateau volatility) from roughly 53 to ~78; (c) Fast downward transition / final trough-like return (approx. 79\u201386) \u2014 a rapid drop from ~2.5 back to ~0 across ~3\u20137 steps (large negative slope, amplitude change ~-2.4 in a short window); (d) Late baseline jitter (approx. 86\u2013149) \u2014 low-amplitude near-zero noise with occasional small spikes, values ~0.0\u20130.15. These morphological stages and numeric ranges match the preliminary summary and are visible in the provided plot.\n\n2) Time-frequency mapping (STFT) and energy distribution: The STFT shows dominant energy concentrated at the lowest frequency row (0 Hz) and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows during the plateau stage (highest energy region is between ~53 and ~78), consistent with a long DC-like plateau producing strong low-frequency content. During the descent (approx. 79\u201386) the STFT still shows concentrated low-frequency energy but with some spread to adjacent low-frequency rows because of the abruptness (transient content introduces slightly broader low-adjacent-frequency energy). Early and late baseline epochs show only weak low-frequency energy. This mapping is consistent with the preliminary description.\n\n3) SHAP heatmap mapping to features and sign interpretation: The SHAP heatmap shows mainly blue shading across the central portion of the plateau in the 0 Hz and immediate low-frequency rows (i.e., the plateau center is marked as atypical relative to label 1). The immediate pre- and post-descent region and the descent window itself show red (positive SHAP) at the lowest-frequency row indicating that the abrupt final downward transition is treated by the model as a supporting/typical cue for the class being evaluated in the heatmap context. Early and late baselines are near-neutral with only faint mixed cells, consistent with the preliminary summary marking them as neutral/not decisive. This heatmap-color-to-feature mapping is explicitly stated in the preliminary summary and matches visual evidence.\n\n4) Why misclassification occurs and boundary identification: The combination of (i) an extended, atypical mid-sequence plateau (blue in SHAP; strong low-frequency / DC energy; contradicts label 1\u2019s 'no peaks' expectation) and (ii) a sharp final downward transition that spectrally and morphologically resembles the 'Down' signature in the final period (red in SHAP around the descent; concentrated low-frequency energy at the transition) creates a conflicting classification signal. The model\u2019s logits (label 2 > label 1 by a small margin: 1.0607 vs. 0.8577) indicate the final trough-like event and the plateau\u2019s atypicality combine to push the sample across the decision boundary toward label 2. The plateau reduces confidence in label 1 (blue influence) while the final descent increases label 2 support (red influence). Early and late baseline jitter are minor and not decisive.\n\nConclusion: The preliminary feature summary already enumerates and interprets all misclassification-driving events (early baseline neutral, large mid-sequence plateau marked blue/atypical, abrupt final downward trough marked red/typical-for-other-labels, late baseline jitter neutral). There are no omitted boundary-driving features in the preliminary summary; it captures the morphology, amplitude ranges, rate-of-change, STFT frequency mapping, heatmap coloration and the combined pattern that leads to misclassification. Therefore no additional feature entries are necessary beyond what is already provided in the preliminary summary."

Heatmap color: predominantly blue (negative SHAP) in the low-frequency rows corresponding to the trough time windows; occasionally weak or neutral elsewhere. Heatmap interpretation: the model considers these large troughs atypical for the predicted class (blue = atypical), and in these samples the valley evidence is not strong enough (in the model's view) to overcome the mid-sequence plateau evidence favoring class 1.

Heatmap interpretation: these edges strengthen the model's confidence in the plateau feature and thus indirectly contribute to misclassification.",
        "Intermediate low-level positive energy preceding plateau (weak pre-plateau increase) - occurrence: small positive buildup just before plateau in some samples (e.g., sample 132 shows slight rise ~time 45). Manifestation: small amplitude increase (~0.1-0.3) lasting a few time steps. Time-frequency mapping: faint low-frequency energy. Heatmap color: faint red in low-frequency rows or neutral. Heatmap interpretation: weakly typical/ambiguous; these features marginally support the plateau interpretation but are minor contributors."

        "Sample 121 (True label: 2 (Down) ; Model predicted: 1). Pattern composition: Early deep valley (valley at time ~20-30, amplitude approx -2.0) (blue in heatmap at 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows \u2192 interpreted as atypical by model) + Mid-sequence large positive plateau (time ~50-95, amplitude approx +1.8-1.95, low volatility) (strong red in 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows \u2192 interpreted as typical for predicted class) + Stable low-amplitude jitter in pre/post regions (neutral/faint) (heatmap near-neutral). Heatmap mapping: the model's SHAP heatmap shows strong negative contributions (blue) located at the early trough low-frequency bins but dominant positive contributions (red) across the plateau low-frequency bins. Why misclassified: although the sample contains the label-2-defining trough, the model gives much stronger positive evidence to the mid-sequence plateau (red, large magnitude at low frequencies), and the atypical marking of the trough is not sufficient to flip the decision. Logits: [-1.078, 1.670, 1.241] show class 1 highest, indicating plateau evidence overwhelms trough evidence.",
        "Sample 132 (True label: 2 (Down) ; Model predicted: 1). Pattern composition: Mid-sequence sustained plateau (time ~50-95, amplitude approx +2.0-2.2, pronounced, low-frequency concentrated energy) (strong red in 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows \u2192 typical for predicted class) + Late localized trough (time ~122-132, amplitude approx -1.2 to -1.4) (blue in low-frequency rows in heatmap \u2192 atypical) + Minor pre-plateau small rise (weak red/neutral). Heatmap mapping: bright red low-frequency region during plateau dominates; blue low-frequency region at late trough is visible but less influential. Why misclassified: the model prioritizes the dominant mid-sequence plateau as evidence for class 1; the late trough is considered atypical and not decisive. Logits: [-0.798, 1.904, 1.261] indicate strong preference for class 1 (largest logit), consistent with red plateau influence.",
        "Sample 143 (True label: 2 (Down) ; Model predicted: 1). Pattern composition: Mid-sequence plateau (time ~45-105, amplitude approx +1.5-1.7, sustained) (red in low-frequency 0Hz row and adjacent rows \u2192 typical) + Late deep trough (time ~118-125, amplitude approx -2.3) (blue in low-frequency rows in heatmap \u2192 atypical) + Minor baseline jitter elsewhere (neutral). Heatmap mapping: model SHAP shows a clear red band across plateau low-frequency bins and a blue band at the trough low-frequency bins; the plateau red region is stronger. Why misclassified: despite a deep late trough characteristic of label 2, the model's decision is dominated by the mid-sequence upward plateau which it regards as typical for the predicted class (class 1). Logits: [-0.997, 1.466, 1.098] with class 1 largest, indicating plateau influence overcame trough evidence.",
        "Reflection on boundary features and misclassification mechanism (combined across samples): In all three samples the recurring boundary pattern is 'strong mid-sequence sustained positive plateau (low-frequency concentrated energy and red in heatmap) + localized deep trough (the down-feature expected for label 2) marked as blue in heatmap'. The model assigns greater positive weight to the plateau (red, typical for predicted class 1), while the true label's defining trough is judged atypical (blue) or insufficient, producing misclassification. The logits across samples consistently show class 1 with the highest logit, confirming that the plateau feature dominates model decision-making. Therefore, the combination of a dominant, sustained upward plateau and a localized trough is a prototypical boundary pattern that causes the model to prefer the non-true label."
