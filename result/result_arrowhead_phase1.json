Heatmap: clear red at low-frequency cells corresponding to the late peak; a small nearby blue patch at slightly higher frequency/time localized near ~170-180. Interpretation: late peak is a typical, discriminative feature (red at 0Hz). Minor higher-frequency component near the late rise is seen as ambiguous/atypical (slight blue) likely due to small waveform differences between classes.",

STFT: concentrated low-frequency (0 Hz row) energy at the peak times but SHAP heatmap shows mixed/blue marking over parts of the early peak window (notably around t\u224848), i.e. the model treats some of the early-peak low-frequency energy as atypical for Avonlea. Classification role: atypical (blue/mixed) \u2014 early-peak low-frequency energy inconsistent with prototypical Avonlea signature and moves prediction away from class0.",

STFT: narrow low-frequency energy, possibly small spread into adjacent freq rows if jittered; SHAP: mixed coloring (some red where morphology matches Avonlea, but portions flagged blue when placement/amplitude is off). Classification role: ambiguous/atypical (mixed red/blue) \u2014 contributes to confusion by interrupting the canonical peak\u2013trough spacing.",
        "Central trough (time ~90\u2013140): trough amplitude is relatively shallow (around -0.6 to -0.8 rather than a very deep valley). Plot shows small oscillations/jitters inside the trough (\u00b10.05\u20130.15). STFT: lower 0 Hz energy than a deep Avonlea trough and visible dispersion into adjacent higher-frequency rows (evidence of jitter).

In the STFT this corresponds to concentrated energy in the 0 Hz row at those time bins. In the SHAP heatmap the early-peak region is largely red at the 0 Hz row (positive contribution / typical Avonlea evidence) but with some mixed / pale-blue pixels at adjacent low-frequency rows and a few time bins (indicating a small amount of ambiguity). Classification type: mostly typical (red at 0 Hz) but partially ambiguous where adjacent-frequency cells show slight blue \u2014 the model therefore treats the early peak as supportive of class0 but not fully decisive.\n\n2) Mid-region shallow trough and small rebound (time \u2248 90\u2013130): The central trough is present between roughly 90 and 130 time steps with amplitudes around -0.9 to -1.05 (not an extreme deep valley but clearly below baseline). In the plot there is a shallow nadir with a short local rebound / notch around ~112\u2013120 (a small upward wiggle inside the trough). In the STFT the trough appears as lower 0 Hz energy compared with a very deep Avonlea trough; there is also visible spectral spread into adjacent frequency rows indicating higher-frequency jitter inside the trough. In the SHAP heatmap this mid trough region shows predominant blue at the 0 Hz row and additional blue/pale-blue marks in adjacent low-frequency rows (and some mixed coloring) \u2014 signifying that the model regards this trough morphology as atypical for Avonlea and more Clovis-like. Classification type: atypical (blue), and this is the principal negative evidence against class0.\n\n3) Mid-slope local bulge / secondary small peak (time \u2248 60\u201395): On the descending slope of the first peak and the approach to the trough there is a low-amplitude local bulge (amplitude roughly +0.3 to +0.8 in the plot at around 65\u201385). In the STFT this produces a narrow 0 Hz energy spike and some minor adjacent-frequency energy if jittered. In SHAP the region is mixed: pockets of red where the bulge aligns with canonical Avonlea spacing, but also pale blue where placement and amplitude are slightly off \u2014 overall ambiguous. Classification type: ambiguous (mixed red/blue).\n\n4) Late / second peak (time \u2248 165\u2013200): A clear positive late peak centered ~180\u2013195 with amplitude \u2248 +1.0 to +1.4. STFT shows strong 0 Hz energy at those bins. SHAP marks this region mostly red on the 0 Hz row (typical Avonlea evidence). Classification type: typical (red) \u2014 supportive but insufficient to override the mid-region atypical cues.\n\n5) End baseline descent (time \u2248 220\u2013250): Strong negative terminal descent reaching \u2248 -1.6 to -1.8. STFT again shows concentrated low-frequency (0 Hz) energy and SHAP shows this region as red (typical Avonlea feature). Classification type: typical (red).\n\n6) Trough jitter / higher-frequency perturbations inside trough (time \u2248 100\u2013125): Small oscillations of amplitude ~0.03\u20130.15 inside the central trough. STFT shows energy spread into adjacent (non-zero) frequency rows, and SHAP highlights small blue patches off the 0 Hz row in this interval. Classification type: atypical (blue at non-zero freq rows) \u2014 the model penalizes these high-frequency perturbations inside an expected smooth trough.\n\n7) Local ambiguous low-frequency activity around ~170\u2013195 (near the turn-up to the late peak): Some small blue shading at the 0 Hz row in the SHAP map near the early portion of the late-peak rise (~171\u2013195). In the plot this corresponds to the rising slope from trough toward the late peak where the slope shape is slightly irregular; STFT shows modest 0 Hz energy but some spread. Classification type: ambiguous/atypical (small blue) \u2014 contributes modest negative evidence for Avonlea."

Role: positive evidence for class0 but not dominant.\n+ Stage B (mid, t \u2248 90\u2013130): Central trough that is shallower than prototypical Avonlea (amplitude ~-0.9 to -1.05) and contains a small rebound/notch (~112\u2013120) plus localized jitter. STFT reveals the trough has less concentrated 0 Hz energy and a wider spectral footprint (adjacent freq rows). SHAP marks this entire mid-region mainly blue at 0 Hz and blue/pale-blue at adjacent rows (atypical for Avonlea). This mid-region is the primary negative/contradictory signal and shifts model belief away from class0 toward class1.\n+ Stage C (late, t \u2248 165\u2013200): Strong second peak (amplitude +1.0 to +1.4) with concentrated 0 Hz STFT energy; SHAP largely red on 0 Hz (typical).

Role: supports class0.\nNet effect: The combination is classic boundary behavior \u2014 robust positive evidence for Avonlea at early peak, late peak and terminal descent (red) but a mid-phase trough that is insufficiently deep and contains higher-frequency jitter (blue) that the model weights more heavily as evidence against Avonlea. Because the mid-region blue/atypical signal is strong in SHAP and the model's decision boundary gives it high influence, the classifier's logits favor class1 (Clovis) despite multiple later-stage red signals. The small ambiguous bulges on mid-slopes further undermine a consistent canonical Avonlea signature, increasing confusion and leading to Predicted=1.",
        "Detailed analysis (sample 33) \u2014 summary of observable features, time-frequency mapping, heatmap interpretation, and why this is a boundary sample:\n\nObservations from the time series plot: The sequence shows a clear three-stage morphology: (1) an early large positive first peak centered roughly between time steps 40\u201370 with amplitude near +1.4 to +1.6, (2) a mid-region negative trough between about 90\u2013130 with amplitude roughly \u22121.0 to \u22121.05 and a small central rebound/notch around ~112\u2013120, and (3) a late positive second peak between ~165\u2013195 with amplitude about +1.0\u2013+1.4 followed by a steep negative terminal descent from ~220\u2013250 crossing roughly \u22121.6 to \u22121.9. Additionally there are small localized bulges on the descending slope of the first peak (around 60\u201385) and small oscillatory jitters inside the central trough (visible as tiny rapid wiggles around 100\u2013125).\n\nTime-frequency (STFT) mapping: The STFT image shows concentrated energy at the lowest frequency band (0 Hz row) coincident with the large deviations from baseline: the early first peak, the mid trough, and the late second peak and terminal descent. Importantly, the mid trough interval exhibits measurable energy not only in the 0 Hz row but also spread into adjacent non-zero frequency rows \u2014 consistent with the observed small oscillations/jitters and the notch/rebound inside the trough. The early and late peaks are more compact in frequency (dominant 0 Hz energy) whereas the mid trough exhibits a broader spectral footprint.\n\nSHAP heatmap interpretation (mapping to label evidence): The heatmap colors indicate the model treats most 0 Hz energy at the main peaks as positive/typical (red). Specifically, the early-first-peak 0 Hz cells are largely red (supporting Avonlea), and the late-second-peak / terminal descent 0 Hz cells are also largely red (typical Avonlea evidence). In contrast, the mid-region trough interval shows atypical signatures: non-zero frequency rows and portions of the mid trough window are marked with blue or mixed coloring, indicating the model regards the frequency spread and local oscillations in that trough as atypical for Avonlea and more like other classes. Small blue patches also appear on some adjacent-frequency rows around the mid-to-late transition, consistent with irregular slope shapes.\n\nWhich features are typical vs atypical per the heatmap:\n- Typical (red): concentrated low-frequency (0 Hz) energy at the early first peak (t~40\u201370) and at the late second peak and terminal descent (t~165\u2013205 and 220\u2013250). These reinforce Avonlea morphology.\n- Atypical (blue / mixed): the mid trough (t~90\u2013130) \u2014 especially non-zero frequency components and the small rebound/notch around ~112\u2013120 \u2014 are blue or mixed, showing the model penalizes the trough\u2019s shallowness and its higher-frequency jitter as non-canonical.\n- Ambiguous: the low-amplitude mid-slope local bulge (~60\u201385) shows mixed red/blue in places, so it provides inconsistent evidence.\n\nWhy this is a classification boundary sample: The model logits [0.460, 2.481, \u22122.346] show a clear preference for class1 (Clovis) even though many late/early features favor Avonlea. The decisive factor is the mid-region trough morphology: its shallowness relative to an ideal Avonlea trough plus localized high-frequency perturbations spreads spectral energy into adjacent rows, producing blue SHAP markings that the model weights strongly as evidence against Avonlea. That atypical mid-trough signal outweighs the red evidence at peaks/descent, moving the decision to class1. The small mid-slope bulge and the trough\u2019s internal notch/jitter amplify ambiguity and strengthen the boundary effect.\n\nComparison with preliminary label summary: The preliminary feature summary for Avonlea already describes these exact boundary cues \u2014 a strong early peak, shallower mid trough with jitter and rebound, small mid-slope bulges, strong late peak and deep terminal descent, and the mapping that mid-region blue/atypical features dominate the model\u2019s decision. Therefore there are no substantive omissions for sample 33 in the provided preliminary summary; the existing summary covers the misclassification-causing features and pattern for this sample."

STFT shows concentrated low-frequency energy at the same time region. Heatmap: red dominant at low-frequency rows in most samples (Samples 69,72,100,111,112).

Heatmap: mixed colors \u2014 often red at the 0Hz row near the trough edges (model sees this energy as typical) but with local blue patches at low/adjacent frequencies where the trough shows irregularities (mid-bump or jitter).

        "Pattern A (true label: Clovis / label 1; misclassified as label 0): Combination of two prototypical low-frequency positive lobes (early peak ~35\u201365 and late peak ~170\u2013205), both with strong concentrated 0 Hz energy and red SHAP contributions, plus a central deep trough (~90\u2013140) that is punctuated by a small positive mid-bump (~105\u2013125) and accompanying micro-jitter. Detailed description: Early stage (time ~0\u201370) shows a large, smooth positive hump rising from negative baseline (start near -2.0) to ~+1.2\u20131.5 (red at 0Hz in SHAP). Middle stage (time ~90\u2013140) shows a deep valley reaching ~-1.0 with a noticeable internal positive bump that increases the center trough from -1.0 to about -0.4 locally; the STFT shows some spread of energy into adjacent frequency rows here and SHAP marks core low-frequency trough edges as mixed-to-red but the mid-trough cell(s) and higher-frequency rows as blue (atypical) \u2014 this creates ambiguity. Late stage (time ~170\u2013205) presents a second large, smooth positive hump symmetrical to the early hump (again, red at 0Hz). How this pattern causes misclassification: The two strong low-frequency peaks carry heavy positive SHAP support toward class 0 (predicted label) and dominate the logits \u2014 logit vector [3.4048, 0.3166, -3.0329] shows class 0 receives the largest support. The central trough\u2019s atypical mid-bump and HF jitter are marked blue and reduce support for the true label (label 1), but not sufficiently to overcome the combined red evidence from both peaks. Net effect: strong biphasic positive lobes (typical for class 0) + a central trough with atypical internal structure (blue) forms a boundary configuration that the model resolves in favor of label 0. This pattern explains the near-zero logit for class 1 (0.3166) despite the sample being consistent with Clovis morphology in some respects \u2014 the red peak energy overwhelms blue mid-trough penalties. Conclusion: the crucial boundary contributors are (1) the pair of strong low-frequency peaks (red at 0Hz) and (2) the mid-trough internal bump + HF jitter (blue at adjacent rows). The preliminary summary covered most of these elements; the additional explicit boundary contributor worth noting is the pronounced negative baseline at sequence edges (sustained DC offset) which supplies additional low-frequency energy that aligns with class-0 support.",
        "Comprehensive analysis and confirmation that the preliminary summary already covers the misclassification-driving features for Sample 112 (no missing feature items). Detailed explanation follows. \n\nOverview of the waveform (plot): The series begins at an extreme negative baseline (~ -1.9 to -2.0) and rises smoothly to a large early positive convex peak centered around time steps ~40\u201360 with amplitude about +1.3\u20131.6 above baseline. After the early peak the signal descends through zero into a broad central valley between roughly t\u224890\u2013140 whose minima are around -1.0. Inside that central trough there is a small localized positive bump (a raised shoulder) around t\u2248105\u2013125, plus small micro-oscillations (fine jitter) on the trough floor. Finally the signal rises to a second large smooth positive peak around t\u2248180\u2013200 (amplitude ~+1.2\u20131.5) and declines back to the negative baseline at the end (\u2248 -1.9 to -2.0). Morphology: pronounced bimodal positive lobes separated by a deep central trough with a localized mid-trough bump and slight high-frequency jitter. Rate of change: gentle, low-curvature rises and falls for the two large peaks (low-frequency content), small localized curvature change for the mid-bump (low-to-mid frequency content) and very small amplitude HF wiggles (higher-frequency components).\n\nMapping to the STFT: The STFT image shows concentrated energy at very low frequencies (0 Hz row and adjacent low-frequency rows) centered around the two large positive peaks (early and late) and around the trough edges; the mid-trough bump and local jitter cause slight spreading of energy into adjacent slightly higher frequency rows (visible as a broader band in the mid region). DC/0-Hz energy is also visible near the sequence edges due to the sustained negative baseline at start and end.\n\nHeatmap color mapping and interpretation: The SHAP heatmap marks the early peak low-frequency cells strongly red, indicating that the model treats the early positive hump's concentrated low-frequency energy as a typical feature supporting predicted class 0. Similarly the late peak low-frequency cells are strongly red. The 0 Hz row near the sequence edges also has light red, meaning the baseline DC-like offset is treated as typical. Over the central trough, the low-frequency edges show mixed-to-light-red but the trough center (where the small mid-bump and HF jitter occur) contains localized blue patches in slightly higher-frequency rows \u2014 these blue cells indicate the model finds the mid-bump and HF spread atypical for the true label (here corresponding to label 1) and these cells reduce support for the true label. The HF rows over the trough show blue or neutral tones, confirming that micro-oscillation energy is seen as atypical.\n\nWhy the model misclassifies (boundary explanation): The model\u2019s logits [3.233, 0.337, -3.126] show a strong preference for class 0. The dominant drivers are the two strong low-frequency positive lobes (early and late), each producing concentrated 0-Hz energy that the heatmap marks red \u2014 combined they supply a large positive contribution to the predicted class 0 logit. The central trough contains atypical elements (the localized mid-bump and HF jitter), marked blue in adjacent higher-frequency rows; those blue regions weaken support for the true label but are not strong enough to overcome the aggregate red evidence from both peaks and baseline DC. Thus this sample is a classic boundary case: it contains true-label-consistent trough morphology but also contains strong prototypical class-0 peak energy that dominates.\n\nBoundary features summary (explicit): (1) Two strong low-frequency positive peaks (early t\u224835\u201365 and late t\u2248170\u2013205) \u2014 red in 0-Hz row \u2014 powerful, typical-for-predicted-label features that push the model toward class 0. (2) Central deep trough (t\u224890\u2013140) with a localized mid-trough positive bump (t\u2248105\u2013125) and small HF jitter \u2014 these produce mixed/blue markings (blue in higher-frequency rows centered on the bump/jitter) that act as atypical features relative to the true label and reduce support for it. (3) Negative DC baseline at sequence edges (~ -1.9 to -2.0) producing low-frequency energy that is marked light-red and further aligns with class-0 evidence. The interaction of (1)+(3) outweighs (2) producing misclassification.\n\nConclusion on preliminary summary coverage: The preliminary feature summary already documents all of these elements for Sample 112 (early and late low-frequency peaks with red contributions; central trough with mid-bump and HF jitter marked blue; baseline DC offset; logits demonstrating class-0 bias). Therefore there are no omissions to add."

Heatmap color: mixed \u2014 majority of low-frequency energy around the trough is light red/neutral (indicating the trough itself is typical for Mix), but a conspicuous concentrated blue patch at the 0Hz row around t~120\u2013125 (strong negative SHAP) aligned with the upward ripple. Interpretation: the deep trough itself is a typical Mix feature, but the localized upward bump / ripple in the trough (time ~100\u2013125, low-frequency row) is marked blue (atypical) \u2014 this atypical subfeature is a major candidate causing misclassification.",

Interpretation: overall shape is typical for Mix, but not discriminative enough on its own to prevent misclassification when localized atypical features exist.",
        "Detailed analysis (sample 155, presumed true label = Mix / label 2). Overall morphology: the time series shows a deep negative baseline around -2.0 at the start (t\u22480) rising monotonically into the first large positive lobe (peak) between t\u224830\u201370 (max \u2248 +1.1\u2013+1.25). The series then descends through zero into a pronounced central trough between t\u224885\u2013140 (minimum \u2248 -1.05 to -1.15). Inside that central trough there are two localized upward inflections: a short-duration positive reversal around t\u224898\u2013112 and a second smaller upward ripple near t\u2248120\u2013130. After the trough the series rises into a second broad right-side peak between t\u2248155\u2013205 (max \u2248 +1.3\u2013+1.35) with a small notch just before the apex near t\u2248180\u2013185; the series then returns to about -2 by the end (t\u2248250). Time-frequency (STFT) mapping: energy is concentrated in the lowest frequency row (0 Hz) aligned with the two broad lobes and the deep trough, consistent with the smooth low-frequency morphology. Localized micro-jitters / notches (e.g., at the left peak top, the right-peak pre-notch, and the small mid-trough upward inflections) produce modest energy spread into adjacent low-frequency rows but no strong high-frequency band activity. Heatmap mapping (SHAP): the heatmap shows strong red (positive SHAP, typical for label 2) concentrated at the 0 Hz row for the principal left peak time window (~t\u224845\u201373 region) and very strongly for the right peak window (~t\u2248171\u2013195). The central trough region (broadly) mostly aligns with low-frequency red patches indicating the trough itself is a typical Mix feature. Crucially, however, there is a sharply localized deep-blue region (negative SHAP, atypical for Mix) concentrated at the 0 Hz row around t\u2248115\u2013125 (centered ~t\u2248122). This blue patch aligns with the small localized positive inflection / ripple inside the main trough (the brief local reversal that moves the value slightly toward zero but not above it). There is also some smaller blue tinting at neighboring low-frequency rows near the same time window, indicating the model attributes that localized energy as evidence against Mix. Additional minor blue markings (weaker) can be seen at a few other low-frequency times, but none is as concentrated or large in magnitude as the blue patch at ~t=120. Judgment of typicality: (1) Baseline early rise (t\u22480\u201330): strongly red in low-frequency components \u2014 typical for Mix. (2) Left broad peak (t\u224830\u201370): red in 0 Hz \u2014 typical. (3) Central deep trough bulk (t\u224885\u2013140): mostly red in low-frequency rows \u2014 typical. (4) Localized mid-trough positive ripple(s) (t\u224898\u2013125): strongly blue at 0 Hz (and slight adjacent low-frequency rows) \u2014 atypical for Mix. (5) Right broad peak and small notch (t\u2248155\u2013205): strong red at low-frequency rows \u2014 typical. (6) Global low high-frequency content: consistent red in 0Hz across major lobes \u2014 typical. The single concentrated atypical event (the mid-trough localized upward ripple around t\u2248100\u2013125) is therefore the standout atypical feature in this sample."

Therefore the classification boundary is primarily defined by the presence, timing and low-frequency energy of the mid-trough positive inflection. Conclusion on coverage of preliminary summary: the preliminary feature summary already identifies the same key elements \u2014 the global two-lobe shape, dominant low-frequency energy, the deep trough, and specifically calls out the localized mid-trough upward ripple (t\u224898\u2013125) as an atypical subfeature driving misclassification. No additional boundary-causing features beyond this mid-trough ripple are required to explain the model decision."
