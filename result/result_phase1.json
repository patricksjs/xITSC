        "Early sharp positive transient (occurrence t\u22480\u20138): Manifestation: rapid rise from baseline to a local maximum. Observed amplitude range across samples: approx +0.4 to +3.3 (sample-dependent). Morphology: single steep peak with little high-frequency jitter (smooth rise then quick fall in first 8\u201312 time steps). Time-frequency: concentrated energy in the lowest frequency rows (0 Hz row and immediate adjacent low-frequency rows) during the early window. Heatmap colors: predominantly red in the lowest-frequency rows for several samples (Samples 1, 2, 4), indicating the early positive transient is considered a typical feature for the label; occasional weak blue markings in adjacent intermediate-frequency rows indicate small atypical contributions in some samples. Classification: Typical when low-frequency (0\u2013~0.03) band is red; atypical or ambiguous when mid-frequency rows show blue or mixed coloring.",
        "Early-to-mid deep negative valley / prolonged trough (occurrence t\u22488\u201330 / central early phase): Manifestation: a pronounced downward deflection below y=0 (baseline), often the largest negative excursion in the trace. Observed amplitude range: approx -1.0 to -2.6. Morphology: broad valley occupying many time steps (gradual descent then plateau/slow recovery), low volatility (smooth), sometimes with small oscillations at the trough. Time-frequency: strong energy concentrated at low-frequency rows (dominant), occasionally some spread into adjacent intermediate frequencies when small oscillations are present. Heatmap colors: predominantly red in the very-low-frequency region for Samples 1 and 4 (indicating a typical negative trough feature for the label). In some samples (e.g., Sample 3) the mid-frequency rows during this phase show mixed or weak blue, producing ambiguous classification for the oscillatory components. Classification: Tends to be a typical feature (low-freq red) unless intermediate-frequency components are blue, which indicates atypical jitter components.",
        "Mid recovery / positive hump (occurrence t\u224830\u201360): Manifestation: recovery from the deep valley to values at or above baseline; often a broad positive hump/plateau centered t\u224834\u201360 with moderate amplitude. Observed amplitude range: approx 0.2 to ~1.2. Morphology: smoother, sustained positive level compared with short sharp peaks; sometimes a local maxima around t\u224834\u201350. Time-frequency: again dominated by low-frequency energy for the sustained hump; when the recovery is smooth energy stays concentrated in 0 Hz row and adjacent low-frequency rows; if the recovery includes jitter, energy spreads upward into intermediate frequencies. Heatmap colors: generally red at the lowest-frequency rows (samples 1, 2, 4) indicating this recovery/plateau is a typical feature; intermediate-frequency contributions may be lightly red or mixed (ambiguous). Classification: Typical in its low-frequency components; intermediate-frequency variations may be ambiguous or slightly atypical.",

Observed amplitude range: approx +0.2 to +3.0 (sample 2 shows a large late spike). Morphology: can be an abrupt late spike (sharp) or broad sustained elevated amplitude (smooth plateau). Time-frequency: when abrupt, energy appears in low frequency plus some intermediate-frequency spread (reflecting faster change); when broad/smooth, energy remains in lowest-frequency rows. Heatmap colors: large late peaks in Sample 2 have strong red in very-low-frequency rows and also red in some adjacent rows (typical); some samples show neutral or slight blue in intermediate rows, indicating partial atypicality. Classification: generally typical (low-frequency red) for sustained elevation; sharp late spikes may contain mixed typical/atypical signatures (red low-freq plus blue intermediate-freq).",
        "Intermediate-frequency spread and jitter components (occurrence typically during transitions t\u224810\u201340 and during abrupt late peaks t\u224875\u201395): Manifestation: small oscillations / increased high-frequency content superimposed on peaks or transitions (visible as broader frequency spread in STFT). Time-frequency: energy spreads upward into intermediate (\u22480.1\u20130.3) frequency rows; severity reflected by how many adjacent frequency rows carry energy. Heatmap colors: often mixed \u2014 many intermediate rows show blue or alternating red/blue strips (Samples 1, 3 show mixed/blue in mid-frequency bands). Classification: These intermediate frequency components are frequently atypical or ambiguous (blue or mixed coloring), meaning the model treats jittery/high-frequency content as less typical and possibly indicative of non-label-0 patterns.",

Early-mid phase (t\u22488\u201328) broad deep negative trough (down to \u2248-2.2) \u2014 dominant low-frequency STFT energy also marked red (typical). Mid phase (t\u224830\u201355) recovery to a sustained positive hump (\u22480.6\u20131.0) \u2014 low-frequency energy red (typical). Late phase (t>70) minor oscillatory fluctuations around baseline \u2014 some intermediate-frequency rows show weak blue (atypical) while lowest-frequency remains neutral, indicating these small late jitters are less typical. Overall: dominant low-frequency large-amplitude deviations (both positive spike and broad negative valley and recovery hump) are treated as typical (red), while higher-frequency jitter components are ambiguous/atypical (blue or mixed).",

Middle-late recovery to baseline and then a pronounced late large positive peak (t\u224885\u201392, amplitude up to \u2248+3.0) \u2014 STFT shows strong low-frequency energy for the late spike and heatmap marks the very-low-frequency rows red (typical). Intermediate-frequency bands across transitions show mixed coloring (some blue), especially during transitions to the late spike \u2014 these are atypical or ambiguous contributions. Overall pattern: two major low-frequency events (early trough and late spike) drive classification as label 0 and are typical; superposed mid-frequency components during transitions are less informative or atypical.",

Mid transition (t\u224830\u201345) upward slope crossing baseline into a sustained positive plateau (t\u224845\u201380) with moderate amplitude \u22480.8\u20131.2 \u2014 low-frequency energy again important and partly red but the heatmap contains more mixed/blue patches in the intermediate-frequency rows during the transition, indicating the oscillatory/transition components are ambiguous/atypical. Late mild decay back to baseline (t>80) with negligible heatmap contribution. Overall: a canonical pattern of deep initial trough (typical) + smooth recovery to sustained positive plateau (typical in low-frequency band) with transition-related intermediate-frequency components being ambiguous or atypical.",

Mid recovery and broad positive hump around t\u224834\u201360 (\u2248+0.4\u20130.9) with low-frequency red contributions (typical). Late small bump around t\u224870\u201379 is visible with mixed low/intermediate-frequency coloring (slight red in low-freq and near-neutral elsewhere) \u2014 considered typical in its slow component but any higher-frequency detail is ambiguous/atypical. Overall pattern: the sequence of early positive spike + large negative trough + mid recovery hump, dominated by low-frequency energy, corresponds to the heatmap's red low-frequency region and therefore constitutes the model's typical signature for this label; intermediate-frequency spread during rapid transitions is not consistently typical (mixed/blue)."

Manifestation: short-duration positive peak or bump immediately at the start of the heartbeat trace (amplitude range across samples ~0.4 to 3.3 depending on sample). Time-frequency mapping: concentrated energy in the lowest frequency rows (0 Hz row and the first few adjacent low-frequency rows) during the same early time window. Heatmap color mapping: predominantly light-red to red in many samples (Samples 0, 7, 19) for low-frequency rows at the early window, indicating that this early positive transient is a typical feature of label 1 in those samples; in Sample 2 the very lowest-frequency cell at the early window shows a blue patch (atypical) mixed with red elsewhere (ambiguous for that sample). Classification: typically a typical feature (red) for most samples, with occasional atypical/ambiguous markings in Sample 2 at the absolute lowest frequency row.",
        "Deep negative valley / baseline drop (occurrence: time steps ~12-36). Manifestation: a pronounced downward deflection (valley) often reaching below -1, frequently as deep as -2 to -2.6 (magnitude varies across samples), fairly wide in duration (tens of time-steps) and morphologically smooth (slow trough rather than very sharp spike). Time-frequency mapping: strong low-frequency energy localized in the 0 Hz row and adjacent low-frequency rows for the time window corresponding to the valley; energy sometimes spreads to intermediate frequency rows if the trough contains small jitter. Heatmap color mapping: strongly red in the 0 Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows in Samples 0, 7, and 19 (indicating the deep valley is a typical signature for label 1). In Sample 2 the same valley time window includes both red and some blue in the very lowest-frequency cell(s) (mixed typical/atypical), so that sample shows partial atypicality at the absolute lowest-frequency component. Classification: generally a typical feature (red) \u2014 the deep negative valley is the primary canonical feature for label 1 \u2014 with occasional atypical contributions at the 0 Hz row in some samples (ambiguous in Sample 2).",
        "Recovery / rising hump after the valley (occurrence: time steps ~36-55). Manifestation: relatively rapid recovery from the valley, crossing up through y=0, often producing a positive hump or plateau (amplitude ~0.5\u20131.2) with reduced volatility compared to the initial transient. Time-frequency mapping: low-frequency energy concentrated during the ramp-up time window; sometimes intermediate frequencies have small energy if the recovery is jagged. Heatmap color mapping: mostly light-red / mild red across low-frequency rows in Samples 0, 7 and 19 (typical). In Sample 2 this mid-stage recovery also contains mixed red/blue at low-to-intermediate frequencies (ambiguous). Classification: typically interpreted by the model as a positive, label-1 feature for most samples, though less strongly typical than the deep valley itself.",
        "Late-stage small amplitude baseline/plateau (occurrence: time steps ~60-95). Manifestation: after recovery there is a longer duration, low-amplitude positive plateau with small fluctuations and occasional small peaks/jitters (amplitude ~0.0 to 1.0). Time-frequency mapping: low-frequency energy reduced compared to the trough; mid-to-low frequency rows show gentle energy. Heatmap color mapping: mixed: Samples 0 and 7 show near-neutral to slight-red contribution in low-frequency rows (weakly typical); Sample 2 shows stronger red in some late windows (typical) and Sample 19 shows red concentrated in a later low-frequency block (typical). Classification: generally a weakly typical feature (model sometimes relies on these steady positive plateaus as supportive evidence), but in some time-frequency bands it is ambiguous.",
        "Late sharp positive spike (occurrence: time steps ~85-95 in some samples, e.g., Sample 19 and Sample 2). Manifestation: an abrupt high-amplitude positive peak (Sample 19 reaches ~3.3 at ~90; Sample 2 has a late-rise near 90 reaching ~1.9). Time-frequency mapping: this produces concentrated low-frequency energy (if the spike is smooth) and additional higher-frequency energy if the spike has steep flanks or jitter. Heatmap color mapping: Sample 19 shows red at low-frequency rows in the later window (typical); Sample 2 also shows red in later windows (typical). Classification: when present, the late spike in these samples is treated as a typical feature by the model (red), suggesting that large positive late deflections can be part of the normal heartbeat label in this dataset.",

Time-frequency mapping: energy spreads to intermediate and higher frequency rows (broader frequency-band footprint). Heatmap color mapping: frequently light-blue or mixed blue/red in the intermediate frequency rows (indicates occasional atypical contributions). Classification: jitter and higher-frequency content are sometimes considered atypical (blue) or ambiguous, especially when they appear in the mid-late time windows \u2014 the model regards such distributed high-frequency energy with caution.",

Manifestation: consistent sequence across samples: early positive bump \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery positive hump \u2192 low-amplitude plateau (with optional late spike). Heatmap color mapping: the core low-frequency valley and recovery are predominantly red (typical); higher-frequency distributed content and some very-low-frequency anomalies (single-cell blue spots at the 0 Hz row) are atypical or ambiguous depending on sample.

Manifestation: sharp fall from the late positive peak down to ~-0.6 to -0.8 within a few time-steps (line plot), i.e., a short-duration negative trough following the spike. Time-frequency: localized energy in the same late-time window (STFT shows continued energy across low-to-intermediate frequencies). Heatmap marking: low-frequency rows in the late-time block that include the rebound are marked red (the model treats this short post-spike rebound as part of the typical late-stage signature for this sample).

The time-frequency signature that the model treats as most typical (strong red) is concentrated at the lowest frequency rows (0Hz row and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows) during the deep-valley time window (approximately time steps ~12\u201336). Features that broaden into intermediate and higher frequency rows (jitter, sharp flanks, or irregular high-frequency oscillations) are treated as less typical or atypical (blue or mixed), and single-cell blue patches at the absolute 0Hz row in some samples (notably Sample 2) indicate that the model can flag some very-low-frequency deviations as atypical or confusing. In short, the model relies on low-frequency valley + recovery morphology as the canonical, typical fingerprint for label 1, while high-frequency spread and certain isolated 0Hz anomalies are treated as atypical or ambiguous.",

In short: canonical valley\u2192recovery pattern is present, plus a late-stage complex event consisting of a large spike with intermediate-frequency content and a sharp post-spike rebound \u2014 the model treats the whole late-event block (low + some intermediate frequencies) as typical for this sample."

        "Localized 0 Hz (DC) dominance (occurrence aligned with trough/time windows ~15\u201340 or narrow windows at peaks): concentrated energy solely at the 0 Hz row within time windows. Morphology: strong DC-like offset or very slow oscillation in that region (sustained offset). Time-frequency manifestation: very bright 0 Hz cell(s) in STFT. Heatmap color: frequently deep blue at the 0 Hz row (strongly atypical). Interpretation: the model especially penalizes sustained DC-like energy in these windows as non-characteristic of label 1.",
        "Mixed-frequency jitter during transitions (occurrence mostly near slope regions): small high-frequency components superimposed on slope or peak (jitter). Morphology: minor oscillatory jitter or variability on top of main waveforms. Time-frequency manifestation: vertical extension of energy into higher rows (broader frequency coverage). Heatmap color: mixed (patchy red and blue) across higher rows \u2014 indicates ambiguity. Interpretation: jitter per se is not consistently typical/atypical but in boundary samples it increases confusion and can nudge the logit toward misclassification."

        "Sample ID 2 pattern: Early pronounced positive transient at t\u22482\u20138 (+0.4 to +2.0) (low-frequency energy; heatmap mostly red in adjacent low-freq rows = typical) + Broad mid-phase deep negative valley at t\u224820\u201344 (amplitude \u2248 -1.2 to -1.7) with concentrated 0 Hz energy (heatmap strongly blue at 0 Hz and mixed in adjacent low-freq rows = atypical) + Late-phase recovery and rising plateau t\u224850\u201390 (+0.3 to +1.9) (low-frequency energy, heatmap red = typical). Net effect: atypical mid trough (0 Hz blue) outweighs typical early/late features, producing boundary misclassification.",
        "Sample ID 6 pattern: Early moderate positive peak t\u22480\u20136 (+1.0\u20131.9) (low-freq energy; heatmap mostly red) + Extended mid trough t\u224810\u201338 (amplitude to \u2248 -1.0 to -1.8) with strong DC/0 Hz concentration (heatmap deep blue at 0 Hz, adjacent bins mixed) + Pronounced slope and jitter during recovery t\u224840\u201360 (broadening energy to adjacent freq rows; heatmap mixed red/blue). Net effect: strong 0 Hz atypical marking in mid-phase combined with transition-derived frequency spread yields uncertain logits and misclassification.",
        "Sample ID 41 pattern: Early negative-to-deep negative baseline t\u22480\u201328 (sustained negative baseline \u2248 -0.5 to -1.7) producing low-frequency energy; heatmap shows red in several low-freq rows but patchy blue at the 0 Hz row (partial atypical signal) + Abrupt rise around t\u224834\u201345 to a long positive plateau t\u224845\u201395 (amplitude \u2248 +0.5\u20131.3) with concentrated low-freq energy (heatmap mostly red for late-phase) + Some intermediate-frequency structure near the rise (heatmap small blue patches). Net effect: mixture of partially atypical DC signatures and confused transition energy makes the sample borderline.",
        "Sample ID 35 pattern: Very large early positive spike t\u22482\u20136 (+1.0 to +3.2) (strong low-freq plus some higher-freq spread; heatmap shows red in adjacent low-freq but blue at 0 Hz in some windows) + Prominent mid negative trough t\u224818\u201338 (to \u2248 -2.0) with heavy 0 Hz dominance (heatmap deep blue at 0 Hz and mixed coloring in low freq rows = atypical) + Moderate late ramp/plateau t\u224848\u201390 (heatmap largely red). Net effect: extreme amplitude early combined with a very strong atypical DC-like mid trough produces a strong boundary signal; the model's SHAP consistently flags the 0 Hz mid-trough as atypical and drives misclassification."
