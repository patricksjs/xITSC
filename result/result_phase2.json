STFT: modest low-frequency energy. SHAP: low-frequency bins at the earliest columns show light red (positive SHAP) with only small blue in adjacent higher-low bins. Judgment: early positive spike is marked largely as a TYPICAL feature by the model (red in the low\u2011freq/0Hz region).\n        - Early-to-mid drop (t \u2248 6\u201315): rapid descent crossing 0 to slightly negative (\u2248 -0.4\u2026-0.8). STFT: small low\u2011freq energy; SHAP: near-zero or slight mixed coloring. Judgment: minor/AMBIGUOUS feature (no strong atypical signal).\n        - Mid extended trough (t \u2248 15\u201345): broad sustained negative baseline reaching \u2248 -1.2 to -1.6 (deepest around t\u224840\u201344). STFT: pronounced DC/0Hz energy in this time window. SHAP: the 0 Hz (bottom) row in the mid-window is predominantly RED (strong positive SHAP contribution); adjacent low-frequency rows show mild positive or near-zero SHAP. Judgment: despite being a pronounced negative trough in amplitude, the heatmap marks the dominant DC energy in this window as a TYPICAL feature (red) for the model's predicted label.\n        - Recovery / slope (t \u2248 45\u201360): relatively steep rise from trough back through 0 to a small positive plateau. STFT: broader low-frequency spread during slope. SHAP: mostly light-red across several low-frequency rows in the slope/early-plateau columns (mixed but leaning red).

Judgment: TYPICAL (strong positive SHAP contribution).\n\n        Overall SHAP summary: the highest-energy events (mid trough and very-late spike and early spike) are primarily associated with RED at the 0Hz (DC) row in the heatmap.

Temporal grouping: early transient \u2192 mid sustained trough \u2192 recovery/plateau \u2192 very-late spike. For each of these main events the SHAP heatmap shows RED on the 0Hz row (i.e., the model treats those DC/low-freq components as typical features). There is no dominant blue (atypical) marking over any of the main DC energy windows.\n\n        Step 3 \u2014 comparison to provided misclassification patterns and decision:\n        - Label 1 misclassification pattern (from the provided list) is driven by a broad mid-phase deep negative valley that is marked ATYPICAL (deep blue at 0Hz) so that its negative SHAP contribution outweighs supportive early/late features. In this sample the mid trough is NOT marked blue at 0Hz \u2014 it is marked red \u2014 therefore it does NOT match the critical atypical mid-trough signature described for label 1 boundary cases.\n        - Label 0 misclassification pattern is characterized by an early deep negative baseline (time ~0\u201320) that is ATYPICAL (blue in low\u2011freq rows). Our sample has an early positive spike, not an early deep negative baseline, and the early region is marked red in the heatmap. Therefore it does NOT match the label 0 boundary pattern either.\n        - Because all major high-energy events (early transient, mid trough, late plateau and late spike) are treated by the model as TYPICAL (red at 0Hz), the sample is not a boundary that would tend to flip the logit toward the opposite class. Instead the model's SHAP pattern indicates coherent, supporting evidence for a single label. Typical logits behavior (approximate): true boundary/misclassification samples from the provided lists commonly show small magnitude logits or even a slight negative margin toward the opposite class (logit differences on the order of -1.5 to -3 in favor of the wrong class, i.e., near-zero net evidence and high sensitivity to a few atypical windows). By contrast this sample's heatmap suggests a confident outcome with larger-magnitude supporting logit for the model's chosen label (a plausible net logit margin of +2.5 to +5 for the favored class versus the alternative), so it is unlikely to be misclassified for the reasons summarized in the provided patterns.\n\n        Conclusion: the sample's dominant features are not the atypical (blue) early or mid-DC signatures that characterize the documented boundary/misclassification cases. The heatmap shows the main energy windows as RED (typical).

The small isolated blue at the absolute 0Hz cell during the trough is a minor ambiguity that is explicitly described as a possible phenomenon in the label_0 description (intermediate/0Hz ambiguities can occur). This yields a very high match.\\n- Compare to label_1 (normal heartbeat) pattern:\\n  - Label_1 also describes a valley \u2192 recovery morphology in many samples, and its canonical marker is a strong low-frequency deep valley and recovery. Some label_1 samples include late large positive spikes or other late events. The distinction between label_0 and label_1 in the provided summaries is subtle because both share the valley+recovery motif; however label_0 summaries repeatedly emphasize the exact sequence early-sharp-positive \u2192 broad deep trough \u2192 mid recovery hump and low-frequency dominance, which is the pattern we observe. \\n  - Sample 9 lacks the late, very large positive spike that some label_1 examples have (label_1 Sample 19 and Sample 2 often show strong late spikes). The strong similarity to reference label_0 sample (see next step) further favors label_0.\\n- Similarity scoring (1\u20134) per label:\\n  - label_0: 4 (High similarity). Reason: The sample's full pattern (timing, amplitudes, and low-frequency SHAP red blocks in early, trough and recovery windows) matches the label_0 canonical description almost exactly; reference label_0 sample 43 looks highly similar as well.\\n  - label_1: 2\u20133? (I assign 2\u20133 in my internal comparison, but final score must be single; since we return one score overall for chosen label, we give label_0 the 4 above.)\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and finalize decision:\\n- Reference sample 1 (Sample 43, Label 0) is visually and spectrally very similar to the test sample: early positive peak ~+2, deep trough ~-2, recovery to a sustained positive plateau, and SHAP heatmap with low-frequency red dominance. This close match reinforces the classification as label_0.\\n- Reference sample 2 (Sample 1, Label 1) has a different late-time signature (more mid/late energy, late spikes in some label_1 examples) and its SHAP pattern is not as close a match to sample 9 as reference 43 is. \\n- The single localized blue cell at the 0Hz row during the trough is noted but is small compared with the broad red low-frequency block; according to the heatmap interpretation rules, a dominating red region with a small isolated blue spot still counts as the region being typical. That is consistent with label_0 descriptions which allow occasional isolated atypical/ambiguous low-frequency markings.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n- The sample exhibits the canonical label_0 pattern: early sharp positive transient (typical), broad deep negative trough dominated by low-frequency energy (typical, with a minor localized 0Hz atypical cell), and mid recovery to a sustained positive plateau (typical). The SHAP low-frequency red blocks match the label_0 descriptions and reference label_0 sample 43 very closely. Therefore the most likely classification is label 0 (myocardial infarction pattern in the provided labeling schema). The similarity is high (score = 4) because the timing, morphology, amplitude ranges, frequency localization and SHAP typicality match the label_0 pattern almost exactly.\"\n    ]\n}"

Converting to softmax probabilities gives roughly P(label 0) \u2248 0.87 and P(label 1) \u2248 0.13.

Red dominates the core diagnostic region, which is consistent with the model\u2019s high probability for label 0. \\n3) Atypical indicators and ambiguity assessment: The presence of a single localized deep-blue cell at the absolute 0Hz row in the trough is a small atypical mark; intermediate-frequency blue patches at transitions are present but limited. These do not dominate the attribution map. According to the decision rules, regions where red dominates (even if a small blue anomaly exists) count as typical. \\n4) Boundary vs typical: Given the strong low-frequency red blocks corresponding to the major morphological events and the high model probability for label 0, this sample is best judged a typical instance for the predicted label rather than a boundary/misclassification-prone example. The minor blue spots introduce a small ambiguity but not enough to indicate a border-case.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Combine chart analysis with label summaries and other assistants' results:\\n1) Comparison to label summaries:\\n   - Label 0 summary describes exactly the sequence and time ranges we see: early sharp positive transient (t\u22648), early-mid broad deep negative trough (t\u22488\u201330/40), mid recovery positive hump (t\u224830\u201360), and optional late plateau/spike. Low-frequency dominance and red at those time-frequency rows are emphasized as typical for label 0. \\n   - Label 1 has a very similar canonical morphology in some examples (valley\u2192recovery), but many label 1 references emphasize different late-stage patterns (e.g., very large late spike) or slightly different SHAP nuances. The present sample lacks a very large late spike and its attributional pattern (dominant low-frequency red in trough/recovery) matches label 0 reference cases closely.\\n2) Agreement with human analyses: All three other assistants independently concluded label 0 with high similarity scores (4). Their feature extraction and reasoning align with mine: morphology, STFT low-frequency concentration, and SHAP red blocks pointing to label 0. This concordant independent assessment strengthens the conclusion.\\n3) Synthesis: Morphology, time-frequency energy, heatmap typicality, model logits/probabilities and three external analyses are all consistent and point to label 0. The only counterpoint is the small isolated 0Hz blue cell and minor intermediate-frequency blue patches, but these are not extensive enough to change the predicted label.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Final verification, caveats, and final decision:\\n1) Re-check for overlooked patterns: There is no very large late positive spike (which in some label 1 examples is a discriminative feature), and the trough + recovery timing and attributional pattern most closely match label 0 references. The isolated atypical blue cell is noted and explained as a minor anomaly that can appear in both labels; it does not outweigh the broad red signature across low frequencies.\\n2) Confidence statement: The black-box model's prediction of label 0 is credible and well-supported. The model is reasonably confident numerically (~87% probability) and the SHAP heatmap shows the model\u2019s decision is primarily driven by typical low-frequency features aligned with label 0. \\n3) Final classification: label 0 (myocardial infarction event) is the most supported and consistent label given all evidence (charts, heatmap, logits, label summaries, and independent assistants' analyses).\\n4) Recommended note for practitioners: Although classification is robust here, practitioners should be aware of the isolated atypical 0Hz cell and small intermediate-frequency blue patches; in a clinical pipeline these could be flagged for secondary review, but they do not materially reduce confidence in this particular prediction.\"\n  ]\n}"

The model assigns substantially higher score to label 1 (\u22480.85) vs label 0 (\u22480.20) \u2014 internally the model is strongly favoring label 1. \\n- Heatmap consistency with model decision: the SHAP map contains both supportive (red) and opposing (blue) contributions in the most discriminative time blocks. The mid recovery/hump block is clearly red (typical for whichever label the model uses that feature for), and there is a strong red patch at the very earliest low-frequency cell. But the early trough window (which is the largest amplitude deviation from baseline) contains mixed coloring at the 0Hz row (some blue cells inside the trough block). Intermediate-frequency rows during transitions are largely blue. This mixed red/blue distribution in the primary trough window indicates the model is not unequivocally treating the early trough as a single, unambiguous typical feature \u2014 there is confusion/ambivalence in the most diagnostic time region.\\n- Interpretation of credibility: although the model's final numeric score strongly favors label 1, the heatmap does not show an unambiguous, uniformly red signature across the key trough + recovery windows that would fully justify high-confidence label-1 classification. Instead, the heatmap shows a mixture: some low-frequency cells strongly support the class (red), but several important low-frequency cells within the early trough are atypical (blue). That mixed signature implies the model's internals are using conflicting evidence \u2014 the scalar probability is high but the per-cell contributions indicate ambiguity in the most critical region. Thus the model\u2019s numeric confidence appears somewhat overconfident relative to the mixed feature contributions.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare with label feature summaries and the three assistants' analyses:\\n- Both label summaries for label_0 and label_1 list the canonical sequence trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 plateau. The decisive distinguishing cues in the provided summaries are (a) label_1 examples frequently have a small early positive transient before the trough and/or an optional pronounced late positive spike, and (b) label_0 includes examples (explicitly sample ID '12' in the provided notes) where the trace starts in the trough immediately and then recovers to a sustained positive plateau. \\n- The test sample lacks a small early positive bump and lacks a large late spike \u2014 its morphology matches the label_0 exemplar '12' described in the dataset notes. \\n- All three independent assistant analyses concluded label 0 (high similarity), each matching the sample to the label_0 pattern and explicitly noting the strong match to the label_0 Example '12'. Their rationale aligns with the observed morphology (start-in-trough \u2192 smooth recovery \u2192 plateau) and with the SHAP red low-frequency mid recovery block. \\n- Putting the evidence together: morphological match and the documented reference mapping strongly favor label 0 despite the black-box model's scalar prediction of label 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final judgment, ambiguity, and chosen label:\\n- Conflicting signals: the black-box model outputs a high probability for label 1, but the SHAP heatmap shows mixed typical/atypical markings across the crucial trough window (some low-frequency cells blue), and the overall morphology more closely matches the documented label_0 example (lack of initial positive bump and lack of late large spike). The three assistants independently labeled label 0 with high similarity. \\n- Credibility assessment: the model's numeric confidence is high for label 1, but the per-time-frequency contributions show ambiguity in the most diagnostic region; the model therefore may be overconfident or relying on mid/late recovery evidence (which is red) while discounting the trough's mixed signals. Given the explicit dataset notes that sample pattern identical to label_0's exemplar exists, and given the unanimous human-assistant consensus, the black-box prediction is not fully credible here.\\n- Final classification: label 0 (myocardial infarction event). This choice aligns with the morphology, the dominant low-frequency trough\u2192recovery signature as documented for label_0 (including the explicit exemplar '12'), and the three assistants' consistent analyses. The black-box model predicted label 1 with high numeric score, but the heatmap's mixed red/blue in the primary trough region and the absence of label-1-specific cues (early bump or late large spike) weaken the credibility of that prediction and justify selecting label 0 as the most reasonable final result.\\n\\nSummary conclusion: choose label 0 as the most supported label. The black-box model predicted label 1 with high probability, but its heatmap contributions are mixed in the most discriminative trough window and the overall waveform matches label_0 reference patterns (and the three assistants' conclusions), so the black-box result should be treated as low/ambiguous credibility in this instance.\"\n    ]\n}"

Heatmap confirms the model treats the deepest trough and recovery low-frequency energy as the most typical signals (strong red), with small ambiguous/atypical contributions only in intermediate frequencies around transitions.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare to label feature lists and score similarity:\\n- Label 0 (myocardial infarction event) summary: typical signature includes an early sharp positive transient, a broad deep negative trough (low-frequency red), a mid recovery hump, and sometimes a late positive peak. The test sample shares all main morphological building blocks. Similarity evidence: deep low-frequency trough + recovery + early spike match label-0 features. However, label-0 descriptions sometimes emphasize particular intermediate-frequency ambiguities during transitions and sometimes larger late spikes; in our sample the late event is only a small bump and intermediate-frequency spread is minor. Tentative similarity rating: 3 (moderate similarity).\\n\\n- Label 1 (normal heartbeat) summary: canonical sequence early small positive transient \u2192 pronounced low-frequency deep valley \u2192 recovery hump \u2192 late plateau or optional late spike. The test sample matches this sequence very closely in timing, amplitude ranges and \u2014 importantly \u2014 the SHAP heatmap emphasis: the deep trough and recovery in the lowest-frequency rows are strongly red (the label-1 description explicitly flags the deep low-frequency valley and recovery as the primary canonical features). The test sample's early spike, trough, and recovery pattern and the heatmap's red-low-frequency dominance are highly consistent with the provided label-1 reference patterns (see Reference Sample 75). Tentative similarity rating: 4 (high similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision:\\n- Reference sample 75 (label 1) shows a very similar waveform (large early positive transient, deep trough ~t\u224810\u201330, recovery hump around t\u224840\u201355, modest late bump) and its SHAP heatmap likewise emphasizes the trough and recovery low-frequency cells. The test sample's STFT and SHAP patterns are essentially the same concentrated-low-frequency footprint as reference 75.\\n- Reference sample 49 (label 0) also contains similar motifs, so the two labels are intrinsically close on these features. Nevertheless, the strongest guidance for classification comes from which label's pattern list explicitly matches the exact sequence and heatmap emphasis present here: the label-1 pattern description highlights the trough-centered low-frequency red as the canonical fingerprint and describes cases like this with a modest late plateau rather than a pronounced late spike. The test sample matches that description almost exactly.\\n\\nConclusion and final assignment: The sample's morphology and its SHAP heatmap (strong red at the lowest-frequency rows during the deep trough and recovery, modest red during the early spike and late plateau, and only weak/ambiguous intermediate-frequency content) most closely match the label-1 canonical feature pattern. Given the near-complete match to the label-1 pattern and the close correspondence to the label-1 reference sample (Sample 75), I assign label 1 with a high similarity score of 4.\"\n    ]\n}",

The STFT thereby links the large-amplitude deviations (peaks/troughs) to low-frequency content.\",\n    \" - SHAP heatmap (typical/atypical attribution): The heatmap shows the strongest red (positive SHAP) concentrated at the 0 Hz / very-low-frequency rows during the trough time window (~t\u224815\u201334). Low-frequency rows during the recovery and the early positive transient are also light-to-moderately red. Intermediate-frequency rows show mostly neutral to weak-blue patches in some transition windows, but these are sparse and low magnitude compared with the large red block at 0Hz during the trough. In short: the heatmap marks the trough (and to a lesser extent recovery and early bump) as strongly typical for the predicted label, while any intermediate-frequency jitter is minor and occasionally slightly atypical.\",\n    \" - Feature classification from heatmap colors: Early positive transient (low-freq): red/light-red \u2192 typical. Broad deep trough (0Hz and adjacent low-freq): strong red \u2192 strongly typical. Recovery hump (low-freq): red/light-red \u2192 typical. Late small plateau and minor jitters: neutral to weak-red in low-freq and sparse weak-blue in intermediate-freq \u2192 weakly typical or ambiguous.

Label 0 patterns overlap in parts, but the documentation indicates the model treats the trough-centered low-frequency red block as the primary fingerprint of label 1 \u2014 and that is what the SHAP heatmap shows for this sample.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Final judgment and potential caveats:\",\n    \" - Final classification: label 1. The black-box model\u2019s classification (label 1) is credible because (1) the logits show a very large margin in favor of label 1 (very high confidence), (2) the SHAP heatmap attributes strongly positive (red) values to the canonical low-frequency trough and recovery events that define label 1 in the provided summaries, and (3) independent assistant analyses concur with label 1.\",\n    \" - Caveats: Morphological similarity between labels means some individual samples could be ambiguous in general; however, for this specific sample the attribution is concentrated and overwhelmingly typical for label 1. Minor intermediate-frequency blue patches exist but are small relative to the dominant red region and do not materially undermine the prediction.\",\n    \"Conclusion: The black-box model\u2019s prediction of label 1 is well-supported and trustworthy for this sample; therefore the most reasonable final label is label 1.\"\n  ]\n}"

The single intense blue 0Hz cell may have had insufficient impact on the model\u2019s learned decision boundary relative to the many red low-frequency cells elsewhere, producing a confident but likely incorrect label assignment.\\n\"\n        \"- Is this sample a boundary case? It is somewhat boundary-like in the space of the model because it contains both strong typical low-frequency evidence (supporting either label in terms of morphology) and a discriminative atypical 0Hz component that, per the reference summaries, is indicative of label_1. That mixture makes it easy for the model to be confidently wrong if its internal weighting differs from the human-expert prototype.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Final conclusion:\\n\"\n        \"- Final predicted label (my judgment): label 1 (normal heartbeat).

However, despite the high numeric confidence for label 0 (\u224883% probability from logits), the SHAP map and prototype comparisons indicate the model\u2019s decision is not well aligned with the label patterns described and is therefore of low credibility for this case.\\n\"\n        \"- Recommendation: treat the black-box model\u2019s label 0 prediction as not credible here and prefer label 1 after human-in-the-loop review or further model calibration on the 0Hz discriminative cues.\"\n    ]\n}"

The model's heatmap for label 1 reference samples also permits occasional blue (atypical) markings at the absolute 0Hz cell for some samples (Sample 2 in the reference), while still treating the overall trough + recovery low-frequency pattern as typical. The test sample matches this sequence closely in timing, amplitude, frequency concentration and SHAP color pattern (deep trough concentrated in low-frequency rows, red support for recovery and late plateau). The presence of a localized 0Hz blue cell is explicitly documented in the label_1 descriptions as an allowed/observed ambiguity. Therefore the match to label 1 is very strong.\\n- Label 0 (myocardial infarction) reference: typical features also include early sharp positive transient, deep negative trough dominated by low-frequency energy, and mid recovery to positive hump; label_0 reference samples often show strongly red low-frequency marking for the trough (i.e., the trough is usually unambiguously typical in the 0Hz row). Our test sample differs from many label_0 reference patterns in that the absolute 0Hz trough component is strongly blue (atypical) rather than strongly red. Because label_0 examples generally show the trough as clearly typical in the 0Hz row, the test sample is a weaker match to label 0 than to label 1.\\n- Scoring (1\u20134) for the chosen label: I assign label 1 a similarity score of 4 (High similarity). Rationale: the sample's full phase sequence (early bump \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 sustained late positive plateau) and the time-frequency concentration in the lowest-frequency rows match the canonical label_1 pattern very closely, and the particular SHAP signature (0Hz blue + adjacent low-frequency red at the trough) is described explicitly in the label_1 examples (the documented Sample 2 ambiguity). The overlap is >95% of described salient features.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against the two provided references and final verification:\\n- Reference sample 1 (label 0) has very similar line-plot morphology but differs in heatmap detail: trough low-frequency cells are more uniformly red in the label 0 reference, whereas our test sample shows a pronounced blue at the absolute 0Hz trough cell \u2014 a point favoring label 1.\\n- Reference sample 2 (label 1) shows the canonical valley\u2192recovery\u2192plateau sequence and STFT/SHAP blocks similar to this test sample; the presence of an atypical 0Hz cell in the trough region is specifically noted in the label_1 descriptions and matches the test sample behavior. This makes the label 1 assignment consistent with reference examples and the dataset descriptions.\\n\\nConclusion (final classification): label 1 (normal heartbeat). The decision is driven by: (1) strong morphological match to the label_1 canonical sequence (early bump, deep low-frequency trough, recovery to sustained positive plateau), (2) time-frequency energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows for both trough and recovery (typical for label 1), and (3) the precise SHAP pattern (0Hz trough cell blue while adjacent low-frequency rows are red) is already documented as an allowed/ambiguous but still label_1-consistent signature in the provided feature list (thus the single 0Hz blue cell does not overturn the otherwise strong label_1 evidence).\"\n  ]\n}",

This indicates the main events are dominated by slow (low-frequency) components, with limited jitter.\\n\\nSHAP heatmap (typicality/atypicality mapping):\\n- Trough window (approx t\u224815\u201336): the absolute 0Hz row shows a pronounced blue (negative SHAP) while the immediately adjacent low-frequency rows at the same time window show red (positive SHAP). Interpretation: the model treats the trough\u2019s neighboring low-frequency bands as typical for the predicted class, but flags the exact 0Hz component in the trough as atypical.\\n- Mid recovery (t\u224840\u201360): low-frequency rows are light-red to red \u2192 treated as typical.\\n- Late plateau/peaks (t\u224860\u201395): low-frequency rows including the 0Hz row show red \u2192 treated as typical.\\n- Early bump (t\u22480\u20138): weak/neutral to mildly mixed SHAP contributions (not decisive).\\n\\nClassification of features per the task rules:\\n- Trough\u2019s low-frequency energy in adjacent rows (red) = typical feature for a label in this dataset.\\n- The isolated 0Hz-blue at the trough = atypical feature (dominant blue in that particular 0Hz cell), indicating model confusion for that exact frequency/time cell.\\n- Late positive block red = typical feature.\\n- Little intermediate/high-frequency energy and limited jitter = neutral/typical (no strong atypical jitter signature).\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Evaluate the black-box model output (logits) and heatmap confidence:\\n- Black-box logits: [-0.5246, -0.7010]. Softmax approximates to P(label0)\u22480.54, P(label1)\u22480.46. The model weakly favors label 0 but the margin is small (~0.08 in raw exp values or ~0.08 absolute probability). This is not a strong, decisive confidence gap.\\n- Heatmap evaluation relative to the predicted label (label 0): the SHAP map contains both typical (red) and atypical (blue) markings. Critically, the trough \u2014 the most salient morphological event \u2014 shows red in adjacent low-frequency rows but strong blue at the absolute 0Hz cell. According to the provided label summaries, label_0 reference samples generally show the trough 0Hz row as red (typical). The presence of a strong blue at the 0Hz trough cell is more consistent with label_1 reference behavior (some label_1 examples explicitly have an isolated 0Hz blue during the trough while still having red adjacent low-frequency rows). The late block and adjacent low-frequency trough rows are red, which supports classification to the label where such low-frequency trough+recovery+late plateau are considered canonical.\\n- Therefore, despite the model's slight numeric preference for label 0, the heatmap shows mixed/ambiguous evidence (an atypical 0Hz cell but otherwise typical low-frequency signature). This pattern makes the sample borderline but leans toward the class whose documentation explicitly allows this 0Hz-blue micro-pattern (label 1).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Combine evidence from dataset feature summaries and other assistants:\\n- The three other assistants independently concluded label 1 with high confidence (score=4) based on the identical morphological sequence and the SHAP micro-pattern (0Hz blue at trough with red adjacent low-frequency rows and red late-block) \u2014 they noted that this exact pattern is observed in label_1 reference Sample 2 and is consistent with label_1.\\n- Dataset feature summaries: both labels share a similar high-level morphology (early spike, deep trough, recovery), but the distinguishing micro-pattern in many label_0 examples is consistent red at the trough 0Hz row. The test sample has the opposite (0Hz blue at trough) which the dataset documentation marks as an observed ambiguity for label_1 samples.\\n- Given the small logit margin in favor of label 0, the SHAP heatmap micro-pattern and consensus among three independent assistants, the preponderance of evidence supports label 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Conclusion and final judgment:\\n- The sample is a borderline case because of a localized atypical 0Hz marking at the trough; this produces some model confusion and explains why the black-box output slightly favored label 0. However, the dominant low-frequency energy distribution (trough + recovery + late plateau), the red SHAP in adjacent low-frequency bands and in the late block, and the known dataset behavior (label_1 can show isolated 0Hz-blue anomalies) collectively point to label 1 (normal heartbeat) as the better match.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1. The black-box model predicted label 0 with only weak preference (probability \u22480.54 vs 0.46) and the SHAP map shows mixed signals; combining heatmap semantics, dataset feature descriptions, and independent assistant analyses leads to a more credible assignment of label 1.\"\n  ]\n}"

SHAP: a small blue patch appears in the lowest-frequency row around the late small bump (negative SHAP contribution there) \u2192 a local atypical marking but small in magnitude compared with the large mid-window red.\n- Frequency content: dominantly DC/very-low-frequency energy during the major events; little high-frequency spread or pronounced jitter (no strong broadband high-frequency energy).\n\nStep 2 \u2014 feature pattern summary:\nThe sample's pattern is: large early positive transient + pronounced broad mid negative trough (largest magnitude) + recovery to a modest positive mid-late plateau + low-amplitude late jitter/bump. Crucially, the SHAP heatmap marks both the early spike and the large mid trough as red (typical/supporting) primarily at the 0 Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows; only a small late window is blue (atypical), and that blue area is weak compared with the strong red mid-window.

While this sample shares the morphological ingredients (early spike + large mid trough + later plateau) that appear in many boundary samples, the key difference is that here the mid trough and early spike are marked red (typical) by SHAP rather than blue (atypical) and the late blue region is small and weak.

The STFT shows only weak energy there compared with the early trough/recovery; the SHAP heatmap shows little-to-no strong red in that late window (small neutral-to-light markings).

The early spike is present and shows supporting (mild red) SHAP contributions as well.\",\n        \"- The large positive logit for label 0 combined with a red-dominant, low-frequency SHAP footprint indicates the model is confident and not internally confused. The lack of strong blue or widespread mixed coloring in the heatmap means the sample contains features the model considers typical for its predicted label rather than features that are strongly atypical or ambiguous.\",\n        \"- Therefore the black-box model's classification (label 0) is credible. Although human interpreters may reasonably argue label 1 (two of three assistants preferred label 1), the model's internal evidence (logits + SHAP) and the direct alignment of the waveform events with label_0's canonical elements make label 0 the most defensible final choice when weighing model confidence and explanation together.\",\n        \"\",\n        \"Final conclusion: I accept the black-box model's prediction as credible and select label 0 as the final classification.\"\n    ]\n}"

In our sample the SHAP does not strongly mark the early positive transient as a decisive red region \u2014 the main red region is the trough/recovery block. That slightly favors label 1\u2019s characterization (where the trough is explicitly the primary canonical marker) over label 0 in this particular instance.\\n   - Quantified similarity (for the chosen label): Because the sample\u2019s core pattern (deep low-frequency trough + recovery) matches the canonical pattern described for label 1 and the heatmap attribution strongly highlights that block as typical, there is strong evidence of correspondence but not perfect (label 0 remains a plausible match and the early positive spike amplitude is large enough to create some ambiguity). Therefore I give a similarity score of 3 (moderate similarity) to label 1.\",\n        \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision:\\n   - Reference sample 1 (Label 0) and reference sample 2 (Label 1) both show very similar morphology to test sample 42 (early positive bump, deep trough, recovery hump). This confirms that the two labels in this dataset sometimes look very similar in raw waveform shape, and the model\u2019s SHAP heatmaps are the decisive clue.\\n   - The decisive evidence here is the SHAP heatmap: it places very strong positive attribution (red) on the low-frequency trough/recovery block \u2014 exactly the region described as the canonical marker for label 1 in the provided label summaries. The early positive spike is not strongly marked in SHAP as typical in the test sample, which decreases the weight for label 0 (where some examples had that early positive transient treated as a stronger typical marker).\\n   - Given these points, the best-supported classification is label 1 (normal heartbeat). The similarity is not absolute (reference label-0 examples are similar), so the score is 3/4 (moderate similarity).\",\n        \"Final assertion: label 1 (normal heartbeat) with similarity score 3 because the sample's dominant model-attributed (red) feature is the deep low-frequency trough and the subsequent recovery \u2014 the canonical, strongly-typical pattern described for label 1 in the provided summaries.\"\n    ]\n}",

Very strong low-frequency energy in STFT and very strong red SHAP in lowest-frequency rows \u2014 this is the primary/defining, strongly typical feature for the model.  \\n- Mid phase (t \u2248 34\u201360): recovery crossing baseline into a sustained positive hump/plateau (low-frequency dominated, SHAP mildly red) \u2014 typical and consistent with the trough\u2192recovery morphology.  \\n- Late phase (t \u2248 70\u201395): small secondary bump and then stable low-amplitude plateau; SHAP shows only weak support in low-frequency rows for late times \u2014 weakly typical or neutral.  \\n\\nConcise pattern statement: \\\"Early sharp positive spike \u2192 large broad low-frequency negative trough (strongest, very-typical feature) \u2192 smooth low-frequency recovery to a positive hump \u2192 small late positive bump/plateau (weakly typical).\\\" All core events are marked red in the very-low-frequency rows in the heatmap (especially the trough), so the model regards these low-frequency events (and their timing) as typical for the assigned label.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature lists and scoring:\\n\\n- Compare to label_0 description (myocardial infarction): label_0's canonical set includes: early sharp positive transient at ~0\u20138, an early-to-mid deep negative valley (~8\u201330) with dominant low-frequency energy, mid recovery positive hump (~30\u201360), and sometimes a late secondary positive peak or plateau. The sample's sequence and STFT/SHAP signature correspond very closely: the early spike, the dominant low-frequency deep trough with very-strong red SHAP, the smooth recovery, and a small late bump are all present. The SHAP low-frequency red block in the trough window is exactly what label_0 descriptions highlight as typical. This is a near-complete match.  \\n  - Therefore similarity to label_0: High (score = 4).  \\n\\n- Compare to label_1 description (normal heartbeat): label_1's canonical pattern is similar in a general sense (early small positive transient \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 late plateau/spike). In practice many samples in label_1 share the valley\u2192recovery morphology. However, the documentation differentiates them by how events appear in the heatmap and by specific emphasis: label_1 often has the deep negative valley centered slightly later (12\u201336) and sometimes shows mid/late spikes treated as typical; additionally, label_1 examples included occasional blue anomalies at the absolute 0Hz cell in some samples. For the present sample, the heatmap shows consistent red (not the mixed or blue anomalies associated with some label_1 examples), and the early sharp spike + particularly strong, very-low-frequency red during the early-mid trough window more closely matches the explicit label_0 feature descriptions and reference sample 1 (Label 0). Thus label_1 is a possible but less good match (score would be moderate or lower).  \\n\\n- Reference-sample cross-checks:\\n  - Reference sample 1 (Label 0) shows essentially the same morphology and the same STFT/SHAP pattern: early sharp positive transient, deep broad negative trough to \u2248 -2.2, low-frequency dominated energy and strong red SHAP in the mid window, recovery hump, and late bump. The test sample 42 closely matches this reference (temporal alignment of key events and identical SHAP low-frequency red emphasis).  \\n  - Reference sample 2 (Label 1) shares the broad valley\u2192recovery morphology but differs in SHAP nuance and typicality emphasis; the present sample's heatmap more closely matches the Label 0 reference than the Label 1 reference.  \\n\\nScoring justification: Because the sample contains the full sequence of features described in label_0 (early sharp positive transient + dominant low-frequency broad negative trough + smooth mid recovery + optional small late bump), and because the SHAP heatmap shows very-strong red exactly on the lowest-frequency rows in the trough time window (the hallmark described for label_0), the match is essentially complete \u2014 I assign the highest similarity score of 4.\\n\\nFinal classification (after cross-check): label 0 with score 4.  \\n\\nSummary conclusion: Sample 42 exhibits the canonical label_0 pattern (early sharp positive spike, prominent broad deep low-frequency trough, followed by smooth recovery and weak late bump). The SHAP heatmap strongly marks the trough's low-frequency components as typical (red), matching label_0's defining features and matching the label_0 reference sample. Therefore the most accurate classification is label 0.\"\n    ]\n}"

There are no large blue or mixed red/blue blocks that would indicate confusion or strong similarity to the other label.\\n- Because both the logits and SHAP heatmap point to consistent, typical low-frequency features (rather than mixed/atypical markings), the black-box decision appears credible and not like a borderline/confused call.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare with label feature summaries and other assistants:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 summaries describe very similar triphasic morphologies (early positive bump \u2192 deep broad negative trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 late plateau/spike). That similarity explains why human/assistant judgments may differ in ambiguous cases.\\n- The distinguishing evidence here is the SHAP emphasis: label_0 documentation and reference examples described in the prompt emphasized patterns where the early spike plus a dominant low-frequency trough & recovery are treated as typical; the current sample\u2019s SHAP shows the trough/recovery block as strongly typical and the early spike as at least weakly typical \u2014 this matches the label_0 references well.\\n- Among the three assistants, two concluded label 0 with high similarity scores and one concluded label 1 with moderate similarity.

This indicates these large amplitude deviations are primarily low-frequency / slow components.\\n- The late spike (t\u224890\u201393) also shows concentrated low-frequency energy (the STFT low rows show elevated magnitude at the rightmost window), with little broad high-frequency spread visible in the STFT (i.e., the spike is relatively smooth in the STFT resolution used).\\n- Intermediate and higher-frequency rows show relatively little concentrated energy overall; when present (transitions) energy is limited and not widely distributed across many mid-to-high frequencies (so limited jitter).\\n\\nSHAP heatmap (contribution to model) observations and determination of typical/atypical:\\n- Strong red cells (typical) concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows) during the mid time window roughly aligned with the recovery/hump (time ticks in the heatmap ~21\u201343). This block is the most strongly positive SHAP region in the heatmap, so the model considers the mid-stage recovery/hump low-frequency energy to be a highly typical, label-supporting feature.\\n- Early window (early positive transient) shows at most weak-to-moderate positive SHAP at the very lowest frequencies (light red / near-neutral). Thus early spike is somewhat supportive but not the dominant typical signal according to the heatmap (so: weakly typical / mildly supportive).\\n- The deep trough time steps (centered ~t\u224813\u201316) are not the single most intensely red region in this SHAP image; they are encompassed by the larger red block that spans the late part of the trough and the recovery. In other words, the model's strongest positive attribution falls slightly later than the trough nadir, focusing on the recovery/hump. Therefore the trough is treated as ambiguous to mildly typical (not a strongly flagged canonical region here).\\n- Late spike (t\u224890\u201393) corresponds to only faint / near-neutral to slightly red cells in the heatmap's rightmost columns (low-frequency rows). The model gives this feature low-to-moderate positive weight but not nearly as strong as the mid-recovery block (so: weakly typical / supportive but not decisive).\\n- Intermediate-frequency rows (above the lowest rows) across most time windows show mostly neutral to slightly blue/ambiguous coloring; there is little evidence of extensive mid-frequency energy being marked red.

Thus the trough is present but only mildly/ambiguously typical.\\n- Mid phase (t\u224820\u201340): smooth recovery to a sustained positive hump/plateau \u2014 this region contains the strongest low-frequency red in the heatmap and is therefore the chief typical signature the model relies on for classifying this sample.\\n- Late phase (t\u224845\u201385): baseline/low-amplitude oscillations (neutral contribution).\\n- Very late phase (t\u224890\u201395): large sharp positive spike (present but only weakly weighted by the model in the heatmap).\\n\\nInterpretation of the pattern: The model identifies the mid-stage recovery/hump low-frequency energy as the dominant typical feature for this sample; the classic sequence (early spike \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery hump \u2192 optional late spike) is fully present in the time series, but the model's heatmap emphasizes the recovery/hump window as the most decisive region.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature sets and scoring (1\u20134):\\n- Label 0 key pattern summary: early sharp positive transient (typical), early-mid deep negative trough (typical low-frequency), mid recovery/positive hump (typical low-frequency), sometimes late secondary positive peak (typical if low-frequency). Many of label 0's reference examples emphasize the mid recovery hump and low-frequency block as typical.\\n- Label 1 key pattern summary: also shows early positive transient, deep negative valley (the primary canonical hallmark \u2014 strongly marked in low-frequency rows across label-1 examples), recovery hump, sometimes large late spike. Label 1 feature summaries emphasize the deep negative valley low-frequency block (approx t\u224812\u201336) as the primary canonical feature supporting label 1.\\n\\nComparison and reasoning:\\n- Morphologically, sample 51 matches the shared canonical sequence common to both labels: early small positive bump \u2192 deep negative trough \u2192 recovery to positive hump \u2192 late plateau and optional late spike. So purely on waveform shape the sample is ambiguous between labels.\\n- The deciding evidence is the SHAP heatmap's location of strongest red attribution: the model places its greatest positive weight on the mid recovery / positive hump (lowest-frequency rows, t\u224821\u201343). Label 0's description explicitly lists the mid recovery / positive hump as a typical, strongly weighted feature (and some label-0 reference examples in the provided descriptions emphasized the recovery hump and late spike as typical). Label 1 descriptions instead place heavier emphasis on the deep negative trough (0Hz row red concentrated in the trough time window) as its canonical strong marker; for sample 51 the trough nadir is not the single strongest red region in the heatmap (it is only mildly/ambiguously marked there). Therefore the heatmap pattern of sample 51 aligns more closely with label 0's emphasis on the mid recovery low-frequency block being typical.\\n- The late large spike is present but not strongly weighted in the heatmap; both labels can include late spikes in some samples, so that feature does not distinguish strongly.\\n\\nSimilarity scoring (per instruction):\\n- Similarity to label 0: 3 (Moderate similarity). Rationale: The sample shows the full label-0 morphological sequence (early spike, trough, mid recovery hump, optional late spike), and crucially the model's heatmap highlights the mid recovery low-frequency block as strongly typical \u2014 this matches label 0's listed typical features. The match is strong though not perfect because some label-0 examples also emphasize trough energy strongly; here the model's strongest attribution is the recovery hump rather than the trough nadir.\\n- Similarity to label 1: 2 (Low similarity). Rationale: While the overall waveform sequence matches label 1's general morphology, label 1's canonical characteristic is a strong low-frequency attribution centered on the deep negative valley itself. In sample 51 the heatmap's maximum positive attribution is shifted later into the recovery/hump rather than the trough nadir, so the pattern fits label 1 less well. (Because the output allows only one label, label 1 is not chosen.)\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- Reference sample 27 (label 0) shows a similar overall waveform (early bump, deep trough, recovery and late large spike) and its STFT/heatmap also emphasizes low-frequency energy in the trough\u2192recovery windows and the late spike. That pattern is consistent with sample 51's strongest SHAP emphasis on the recovery low-frequency block. \\n- Reference sample 13 (label 1) shows the model strongly highlighting the deep-valley low-frequency block as the primary typical marker (more concentrated at the trough window). Sample 51's heatmap differs by placing the largest positive attribution slightly later (the recovery hump). That difference is the central reason to favor label 0.\\n\\nConclusion and final decision:\\n- Based on (1) the presence of the canonical sequence (early spike \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery hump \u2192 optional late spike), (2) the SHAP heatmap's most strongly red region corresponding to the mid recovery / positive hump (a region flagged by the label-0 descriptions as a typical, decisive low-frequency feature), and (3) comparison to the provided reference examples where label-0 patterns emphasize the same recovery/hump region, I classify Test Sample 51 as label 0. The similarity score of 3 reflects that the match is clear and well-supported by the heatmap emphasis but not an exact one-to-one match (label 1 also shares many morphological traits), so this is a moderately high-confidence classification rather than an absolute certainty.\"\n  ]\n}"

This aligns with the black-box model's prediction and with the assistant (Round 3) whose reasoning most closely matches the model's SHAP emphasis.\",\n    \"- Credibility: High. The logits show an overwhelmingly large margin for label 0 and the SHAP heatmap contains a focused red region on a low-frequency mid-time event that the model treats as strongly typical. There are no large blue-dominated regions that would suggest pervasive confusion. Therefore the model's classification is well-supported by both numeric confidence and by the attribution map.\",\n    \"- Caveats / uncertainty sources: both labels share a very similar morphological skeleton (early bump \u2192 trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 optional late spike). If a human were to prioritize the trough nadir itself (rather than the recovery hump) as the most diagnostic element, one might prefer label 1; some assistants did so. However, the model's internal attribution prefers the recovery hump as the prime cue for this sample, and that drives the classification. Because the sample contains both the trough and recovery and the recovery is the strongest SHAP signal, the classification as label 0 should be considered correct with high confidence for this model.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Conclusion: I accept the black-box model's output (label 0) as credible and select label 0 as the final classification.\"\n  ]\n}"

The SHAP heatmap, however, indicates the model treats the trough's very-bottom (0Hz) component as atypical (blue), while treating adjacent low-frequency contributions in the recovery and early transient as typical (red). Thus the model appears to be partly confused about the trough's absolute 0Hz contribution but finds the overall early-spike + recovery pattern to be typical.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare to provided label feature lists / patterns:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 canonical patterns include the sequence: early positive transient \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery to a positive plateau.

The reference label_0 STFT and the sample STFT show similar concentrated low-frequency energy during the trough and recovery, and both have an early positive transient. \\n- The unusual heatmap signal for the trough (a strong negative/blue marking at the absolute 0Hz row) matches the documented ambiguous/partially-atypical situations described in the dataset notes (some samples in both labels can show an isolated 0Hz blue cell during troughs, e.g., label_1 Sample 2 was described as having a localized 0Hz blue making classification ambiguous). However, the remainder of the trough and the recovery (adjacent low-frequency rows) are red or neutral here, and the overall morphology + STFT strongly resembles the label_0 reference sample (Sample 72), which was explicitly provided and labelled 0.\\n- Practical decision logic: because (a) the sample\u2019s global waveform and STFT energy blocks map very closely to Reference Sample 72 (Label 0) \u2014 early sharp positive transient, prominent wide trough, and a smooth mid recovery plateau \u2014 and (b) the SHAP heatmap marks the early transient and the recovery/plateau low-frequency components as typical (red), the dominant evidence supports Label 0.

The SHAP heatmap similarity is also high for the early and recovery low-frequency bands (both red), with the only discrepancy being the isolated 0Hz blue during the trough (which is documented to occur sporadically and cause local ambiguity). \\n- Given the close morphological and time-frequency match to the Label 0 reference and the fact that the model\u2019s SHAP map still treats the early and recovery low-frequency content as typical (red), I assign a high-confidence classification: label 0.\\n\\nFinal assignment & confidence: label 0 with a high similarity score (4/4).\"\n    ]\n}",

The trough's low-frequency band is largely typical as well (red in adjacent low-frequency rows), but the absolute 0Hz row during the trough contains a localized blue region \u2014 an atypical/ambiguous signal component.

That canonical sequence is present in Sample 53.\\n\"\n        \"  - Key distinguishing heatmap signatures from the summaries: label-1 descriptions emphasize that the deep negative valley (time \u2248 12\u201336) shows strong red in the 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows in canonical examples, and label-1 can sometimes show an isolated 0Hz blue cell (ambiguous) in some samples (the documentation explicitly notes sample-level ambiguity for the absolute 0Hz row in a label-1 reference). Label-0 descriptions also expect strong low-frequency red in the main events, but the documentation mentions that intermediate-frequency spread during transitions is often atypical for label-0.\\n\"\n        \"  - For Sample 53 the overall pattern (valley + recovery) is present and the majority of low-frequency cells for trough and recovery are red; the presence of a localized blue at the absolute 0Hz row is exactly the kind of occasional anomaly called out in the label-1 documentation (sample-level atypical 0Hz cell that doesn't overturn the main low-frequency red signature).

The STFT/SHAP for that reference also shows strong low-frequency energy in the main windows; the reference summary allows occasional small intermediate-frequency content and notes the model may sometimes show mixed cells.

The difference is subtle and lies mainly in small heatmap-level nuances; Sample 53's heatmap pattern (mostly red low-frequency for early + recovery, with a small 0Hz blue during trough) matches documented label-1 ambiguous cases more directly (the summaries explicitly discussed isolated 0Hz blue patches in label-1 samples). The bulk of the SHAP mass for trough and recovery is red (supporting label-1 assignment).\\n\\n\"\n        \"Final decision and similarity scoring justification:\\n\"\n        \"  - Chosen label: label 1 (normal heartbeat). Rationale: Sample 53 presents the canonical 'early small/medium positive transient \u2192 deep broad negative trough \u2192 recovery to positive plateau' pattern that the model's documentation strongly associates with label 1. The STFT shows dominant low-frequency energy in the same windows and the SHAP heatmap marks the early and recovery/plateau low-frequency components as red (typical). The only noteworthy atypical sign is a localized blue at the absolute 0Hz row during the trough, but the label-1 documentation explicitly mentions such isolated 0Hz blue anomalies in some label-1 examples; this does not outweigh the large number of red low-frequency cells that support label-1.\\n\"\n        \"  - Similarity score (to the selected label 1): 4 (High similarity). Rationale for 4: The sample matches the main feature list for label 1 (early positive transient, deep trough dominated by low-frequency energy, smooth recovery crossing zero, sustained positive plateau) with >80% conformity of the key features and heatmap support across the major events. The minor atypical 0Hz cell is consistent with described label-1 ambiguities and does not materially reduce the pattern match.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Confidence caveat: Because both labels share the same canonical waveform structure and the difference often depends on subtle heatmap-level detail, a small chance of misclassification remains when the SHAP map is mixed in the trough.

Both labels\u2019 examples show strong low-frequency energy associated with those events.\\n\"\n        \"\u2022 The three other assistants all favored label 1, placing weight on the fact that some label_1 example descriptions explicitly mention occasional isolated 0Hz-blue patches in the trough. Those assistants argued the localized blue 0Hz cell aligns with documented label_1 ambiguous cases. Their analyses are coherent and correctly note the ambiguity.\\n\"\n        \"\u2022 However, the black-box model itself assigns a high probability to label 0 and its SHAP map displays large contiguous red low-frequency regions during the trough and recovery \u2014 i.e., the model considers those features typical for label 0. The datasets\u2019 label_0 summary also lists the same sequence (early spike + deep trough + recovery) as typical and highlights low-frequency red in its examples. Given that the model\u2019s own explanation marks the same low-frequency blocks as positive contributions for its chosen label, the model\u2019s classification is internally consistent.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Step 4 \u2014 Credibility judgment and final decision:\\n\"\n        \"\u2022 Credibility: The black-box prediction of label 0 is credible. Numerical confidence (softmax \u2248 0.87) is substantial, and the SHAP heatmap shows dominant red in the low-frequency bands that correspond to the principal waveform events \u2014 the very features that both label summaries cite as decisive. The single deep-blue 0Hz cell in the trough is an atypical/ambiguous cue and makes this a borderline case, but it is not large enough (in time-frequency area or SHAP magnitude) to overturn the model\u2019s overall positive evidence for label 0.\\n\"\n        \"\u2022 Boundary vs typical sample: This sample is somewhat boundary-like because both labels share the same canonical morphology and because of the isolated 0Hz atypical cell; nevertheless the overall SHAP mass and the model logits favor label 0 strongly. Therefore it is a borderline sample but with the model and its explanation aligned toward label 0.\\n\"\n        \"\u2022 Alternative: Label 1 is a plausible alternative (three independent assistants gave label 1 and pointed to the isolated 0Hz blue as evidence), so the sample should be treated with caution in downstream tasks. If a conservative decision is required (e.g., clinical safety), one might flag the sample for human review because of the atypical 0Hz cell and the cross-analyst disagreement.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Final answer: I accept the black-box model\u2019s classification: label 0. I rate the model\u2019s decision as internally consistent and reasonably confident, but the instance remains borderline due to the shared morphology between labels and the isolated 0Hz atypical SHAP cell \u2014 thus human review or further corroborating evidence is recommended when high-stakes decisions depend on this classification.\"\n    ]\n}"

The STFT shows concentrated low-frequency energy in this early window (strongest in the 0Hz / lowest-frequency row and immediate low-frequency rows). Morphology: short-duration, high-amplitude spike with little visible high-frequency jitter on the line-plot.\\n- Mid stage (t \u2248 9\u201334): Smooth descent into a broad, deep negative trough. The trough minimum occurs roughly t\u224825\u201330 with amplitude \u2248 \u22122.0 to \u22122.3. Morphology: wide, low-volatility valley sustained across many time steps. STFT: the dominant high-energy block is concentrated in the lowest-frequency row (0Hz) across this mid window (bright yellow/green in the 0\u2011frequency row), indicating a slow DC-like deviation rather than dispersed high-frequency content.\\n- Recovery / mid-late stage (t \u2248 34\u201360): Rapid recovery crossing y=0 around the mid-30s and forming a sustained positive hump/plateau in the \u2248 +0.6 to +1.0 range (notably t\u224842\u201350). STFT: energy during the recovery remains concentrated at low frequencies (0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows) with no wide spread into intermediate/high-frequency rows.\\n- Late stage (t \u2248 60\u201395): Gradual decay of the plateau toward baseline with small low-amplitude fluctuations and a couple of modest bumps (e.g., around t\u224872). STFT: weak low-frequency energy; intermediate and high-frequency rows remain near baseline (no pronounced jitter energy).\\n- Overall frequency characterization: The sample\u2019s major events (early spike, mid trough, recovery hump) are dominated by near-DC / very low-frequency energy. There is minimal intermediate- or high-frequency dispersion \u2014 i.e., track is smooth except for the very brief early spike and the slow trough/recovery.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Which features are ambiguous / could cause misclassification (boundary signals):\\n- The global morphological sequence (early positive transient \u2192 deep negative trough \u2192 recovery to positive plateau \u2192 late low-level decay) is shared in the provided summaries for both label_0 (myocardial infarction) and label_1 (normal heartbeat). This makes the sample intrinsically a boundary-type instance.\\n- The mid trough\u2019s concentrated 0Hz (DC) energy is a canonical, high-salience feature for both labels. According to the prompt\u2019s attribution notes, some models sometimes treat a strong sustained DC-like negative baseline (0Hz contribution) as atypical for label_0 and thus push predictions toward label_1. Therefore the mid trough is a potential misclassification trigger if the classifier\u2019s internal attribution weights treat that 0Hz block as negative evidence for label_0.\\n- Early very-large spike amplitude (~+3.3) is more specifically emphasized by the label_0 reference patterns. If a model underweights the early spike (or if the early low-frequency cell is scored atypical), the model could be nudged the other way. However, in this particular sample the early spike is clear and unambiguous and the STFT shows it as low-frequency concentrated energy rather than high-frequency jitter \u2014 this supports label_0 if the model uses that cue.\\n- Jitter/intermediate-frequency spread is minimal here, so high-frequency-related atypical flags (which often drive ambiguity) are not major contributors for this sample.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching extracted features to label summaries while not over-weighting misclassification-prone cues:\\n- Matches to label_0 (myocardial infarction) summary: early sharp positive transient of large amplitude (present), mid broad deep negative trough (present), smooth recovery to a sustained positive hump (present), and dominance of low-frequency energy for these events (present). The combination of a particularly large early spike plus the broad trough and smooth low-frequency recovery is described repeatedly as a canonical pattern for label_0 in the provided summaries.\\n- Matches to label_1 (normal heartbeat) summary: label_1 examples also commonly show the valley\u2192recovery motif with strong low-frequency energy during the trough. Thus the mid trough + recovery are shared, and label_1 also sometimes includes late positive spikes \u2014 features that make the sample ambiguous.\\n- Do not treat mid-trough DC-only attribution anomalies (noted as a known misclassification cause in the background) as direct evidence for label_1. Instead treat them as potential model-level confounders. Using only signal-level evidence (amplitude, morphology, frequency footprint) the early very-large spike is an identifying discriminator favoring label_0 because label_0 examples in the reference emphasize very large initial transients combined with the trough/recovery that we observe here.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Consideration of black-box output and other assistants\u2019 classifications:\\n- Three independent assistant analyses all labeled the sample as label 0 with high similarity scores; their reasoning aligns with the signal features described above (especially the early large spike + trough + low-frequency recovery).\\n- The black-box model also predicted label 0 (logits: [\u22120.3482, \u22120.7736]), i.e., logit(label_0) > logit(label_1). The margin is modest (difference \u2248 0.425 in logits), implying moderate confidence rather than strong certainty. Given known attribution behavior (some models may overweight or penalize sustained DC troughs), the black-box\u2019s near-threshold logits are consistent with this being a boundary sample.\\n- Synthesizing: signal-level evidence (morphology + time-frequency) and independent human analyses favor label_0. The black-box concurs, but with only modest margin, reflecting the boundary nature.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Final judgment and alternative: reasoning check\\n- Primary classification: label 0. Rationale: The sample\u2019s defining combination \u2014 a very large, short-duration early positive transient (\u2248 +3.2\u2013+3.4), followed by a broad deep low-voltage trough (\u2248 \u22122.0 to \u22122.3) dominated by 0Hz energy, then a smooth recovery to a sustained positive hump (\u2248 +0.6\u2013+1.0) with low-frequency dominance throughout \u2014 matches label_0 reference patterns more directly than label_1 when avoiding reliance on model-only attribution anomalies. The lack of pronounced intermediate/high-frequency jitter further supports the label_0 match described in the label_0 summary.\\n- Alternative (plausible) classification: label 1. Rationale for alternative: the core valley\u2192recovery morphology and the concentrated low-frequency energy during the trough are canonical for label_1 as well. Because the two labels share this morphology and the black-box shows modest logit margin, a classifier with different learned priors could plausibly output label_1. This is why the instance is a boundary case and is susceptible to misclassification if certain low-frequency cells are internally treated as atypical for label_0.\\n\\nConclusion: Based on direct signal inspection (line plot and STFT), pattern matching to label summaries, and taking into account the model\u2019s output and other assistants\u2019 analyses while not treating known attribution anomalies as primary evidence, the most consistent and defensible label is label 0. An alternative plausible label is label 1 due to shared morphological features and the sample\u2019s boundary nature, but the discriminating early very-large spike makes label 0 the stronger assignment.\"\n  ]\n}"

So the broad pattern itself is not unique to one label.\\n- Key discriminant in the summaries: how the model treats the mid trough and the degree/frequency-distribution of energy. For label_0 the summaries emphasize canonical examples with strong low-frequency energy for the trough (typical/red). For label_1 the trough is also a canonical low-frequency signature. The important practical difference here is whether the trough shows additional intermediate/high-frequency spread or unusual single-cell DC anomalies that could make it atypical for a given label.\\n- The test sample's mid trough is deep, broad and dominated by very-low-frequency energy with minimal intermediate-frequency spread. That morphology and time-frequency signature closely match the provided label_0 reference examples (Samples 19, 90, 43, 84) which are visually and spectrally very similar to the test sample.\\n- Therefore the test sample aligns very strongly with label_0's canonical pattern.

This strong resemblance reinforces a label_0 assignment.\\n- The two dissimilar samples include one true label_1 that shows different mid/late behavior and/or greater intermediate-frequency content in later windows; the test sample does not share those dissimilar traits.\\n- Note on boundary / misclassification behavior: earlier rounds of analysis pointed out that when a sample exhibits an unusually strong DC-dominated trough, some black-box models can produce large (negative) SHAP contributions at the 0 Hz row and consequently predict the opposite class (model confusion). Although this sample could therefore be a boundary case that, in practice, some models misclassify (model might lean to label_1 in those cases), that is a model-behavior artifact.

The signal is dominated by very-low-frequency content, with minimal intermediate/high-frequency jitter.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Step 3 \u2014 match to label feature lists and initial label selection (similarity scoring):\\n\"\n        \"- Both label_0 and label_1 feature summaries describe the same canonical waveform sequence (early positive transient \u2192 deep negative trough \u2192 mid/late recovery plateau). The sample therefore shares the core morphological fingerprint of both labels. \\n\"\n        \"- Distinguishing points in the provided summaries: label_0 examples and descriptions place emphasis on an early sharp positive transient, a broad deep trough, and a mid recovery hump \u2014 all dominated by low-frequency energy. Label_1 descriptions likewise treat the deep low-frequency valley as the primary canonical feature, but some label_1 examples include very large abrupt late spikes (with intermediate-frequency energy) as common. \\n\"\n        \"- In this test sample: the late event is a smooth sustained plateau, not an abrupt large late spike with strong intermediate-frequency content. The early sharp positive transient and the broad DC-dominated trough with low-frequency energy closely match the label_0 reference pattern described in the dataset notes and the four 'similar' reference examples provided (Samples 19, 90, 43 and 84), all of which are labeled 0. The STFT patterns are nearly identical between the test sample and those label_0 references (strong 0Hz / very-low-frequency energy during the trough and during the earlier and later low-frequency events, with little intermediate-frequency spread).\\n\"\n        \"- Because the main features (early sharp spike, broad DC trough, smooth recovery and sustained plateau) and their spectral signatures (dominant very-low-frequency energy, minimal intermediate-frequency jitter) match the label_0 examples closely, label_0 is the best match. I therefore select label 0 as the classification.\\n\"\n        \"- Similarity quantification (to the chosen label_0): I assign a score of 4 (high similarity). Rationale for score 4: \u226580% of the main features in the label_0 feature list are present and match in amplitude, timing and low-frequency spectral footprint; the test sample is visually and spectrally nearly identical to multiple label_0 reference samples.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Step 4 \u2014 cross-check with reference samples and ambiguity / misclassification risk: \\n\"\n        \"- The four similar reference samples (IDs 19, 90, 43, 84) are labeled 0 and show nearly identical waveforms and STFT patterns (early sharp positive peak, long DC-dominated trough, recovery and late plateau). This strongly supports labeling the test sample as label 0. \\n\"\n        \"- The two dissimilar references include one labeled 1 whose waveform and spectrogram differ (more distributed mid-frequency content and different late-time behavior). The test sample does not resemble that dissimilar label-1 example.\\n\"\n        \"- Important caveat about misclassification risk: although the test sample matches label_0 strongly by morphology and STFT, previous model/SHAP analyses (not the raw STFT) can flag large DC-dominated troughs at the 0 Hz row as atypical for the model (i.e., a strong negative SHAP contribution for the true label). That means the trained black-box classifier can \u2014 in practice \u2014 misclassify such boundary examples as label 1 with moderate-to-strong probability in some runs (this is consistent with prior round-3 analysis). The present decision is based on feature similarity to canonical label definitions and reference examples, not on the classifier\u2019s idiosyncratic SHAP-driven behavior.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Final conclusion: the sample\u2019s waveform and time-frequency signature are highly consistent with label 0 (myocardial infarction / the label_0 reference pattern).

Prior SHAP/round-3 analyses indicate that some trained models can treat an unusually strong 0\u2011Hz (DC) signature in the trough as an atypical cue for a given true label (i.e., produce a strong negative SHAP contribution for that label). That behavior can flip predictions for boundary cases.\\n\"\n    \"- However, the present STFT shows little intermediate-frequency spread (low jitter), which is generally a stable, typical signal manifestation; the potential misclassification risk specifically arises if the classifier overweights a localized DC anomaly cell rather than the broader low-frequency block.\\n\"\n    \"- Therefore the main misclassification risk comes from the single-feature effect: an unusually strong 0\u2011Hz/DC concentration in the broad trough that some models may interpret atypically. This is a model/feature-weighting artifact and should not be taken as direct evidence of the other class.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 matching the sample features to label summaries (avoiding misclassification traps):\\n\"\n    \"- Both label_0 and label_1 descriptions include the canonical sequence early positive \u2192 deep negative trough \u2192 recovery/plateau; so morphology alone is not uniquely discriminative.\\n\"\n    \"- Distinguishing observations in the provided label summaries: label_0 exemplars emphasize an early sharp positive transient, a broad deep trough and a mid recovery plateau dominated by low-frequency energy; label_1 also lists the valley\u2192recovery motif but in many of its exemplars there can be either stronger late spikes or different timing/shape characteristics and more examples with intermediate-frequency contributions flagged as atypical.\\n\"\n    \"- The sample's combination \u2014 a pronounced early high-amplitude sharp spike together with a broad, smooth, DC-dominated trough and a smooth late plateau with minimal intermediate/high-frequency jitter \u2014 aligns closely with the canonical label_0 exemplars described in the documentation and with the four 'similar' label_0 reference samples pointed out by other assistants.\\n\"\n    \"- Because the mid trough is DC-heavy (the potential misclassification trigger), I explicitly avoid letting that artifact alone drive the decision. Considering the whole set of stable features (early spike magnitude/timing, trough morphology, late plateau shape, and concentrated low-frequency energy across the whole event), the feature set overall more closely matches label_0's canonical pattern.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 reconcile with other analyses and the black-box prediction:\\n\"\n    \"- Independent assistants (Rounds 1\u20133) all assigned label 0 with high similarity scores (4/4) and gave the same phase decomposition and rationale that we used above. Their analyses emphasize the strong similarity to label_0 exemplars and note the boundary/misclassification risk due to DC dominance of the trough.\\n\"\n    \"- The black-box model's reported prediction is label 0 (predicted: 0) with logits [0.13307632505893707, -1.663553237915039], i.e., the model also chose label 0 (class-0 logit higher than class-1 logit).

The main alternative (label 1) remains a plausible secondary hypothesis because the valley\u2192recovery motif appears in both label definitions; however, for this sample the detailed amplitude/timing and the absence of pronounced intermediate-frequency jitter favor label_0.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Step 5 \u2014 verification and final decision (including caveats):\\n\"\n    \"- I verified that no single anomalous cell (e.g., extreme, isolated 0\u2011Hz SHAP negativity) is being used as the sole basis for the decision; rather the full pattern (early spike + broad DC trough + smooth recovery and sustained plateau) was evaluated. The feature most often cited as a misclassification trigger (very-strong DC content in the trough) is present, but it is part of the broader low-frequency block rather than an isolated jagged/high-frequency signature that would point strongly to label_1.\\n\"\n    \"- Final classification: label 0 (myocardial infarction event) is the most supportable and consistent label given the data, other analysts, and the black-box output.\\n\"\n    \"- Alternative classification: label 1 is a reasonable secondary possibility because both labels share the main valley\u2192recovery morphology; this sample is a boundary-type example in that sense. If model-specific SHAP weighting heavily penalizes DC trough cells, some classifiers could misclassify it as label 1. That risk should be treated as a model idiosyncrasy rather than a primary signal of label_1 in this particular sample.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Conclusion: Classify as label 0 (primary).

The task background told us this is a boundary case where the black-box tends to predict label_1 while true label is label_0; our careful feature check must therefore emphasize distinguishing subtleties (broad, very low-frequency dominant trough and the particular smoothness/shape patterns) that align better with label_0 examples.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 3 (quantified similarity scoring across labels):\",\n    \"- Similarity to label_0: 4 (High similarity).

Late phase t\u224870\u201395 = mild plateau then abrupt late spike and quick rebound downward.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Which sample features could cause black-box misclassification (shared/ambiguous features):\\n- The core motif 'deep negative trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 positive plateau \u2192 optional late spike' is common to both label_0 and label_1 reference sets. That shared valley\u2192recovery morphology is the single strongest overlap and is the primary reason automated models confuse the labels on boundary cases.\\n- The sample\u2019s late positive spike and the dominant low-frequency energy during trough+recovery are also present in both labels in some reference examples. In particular, label_1 references frequently show the strong low-frequency valley block that many models treat as the canonical indicator of label_1; thus a model that overweighted that single feature could predict label_1.\\n- Features to avoid over-weighting as a direct decision basis: the mere presence of a deep trough followed by recovery and a late spike should not be used alone to prefer label_1 because those are shared. The absence of an early positive transient (which would favor label_1 when present) is a discriminative detail and should be used carefully.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match the sample features to the label summaries while discounting the misleading shared features:\\n- Match with label_0 (myocardial infarction) summary: Label_0\u2019s typical pattern includes an early-to-mid deep negative valley (t\u22488\u201330), smooth low-frequency-dominant recovery/hump (t\u224830\u201360), and sometimes a late secondary positive peak or plateau (t\u224860\u201395). The sample matches these label_0 features closely in timing, amplitude and STFT-energy concentration. Importantly, label_0 examples in the summary also include cases without an early positive transient (consistent with this sample).\\n- Match with label_1 (normal heartbeat) summary: Label_1 also often exhibits valley\u2192recovery\u2192late spike and the label_1 descriptions emphasize the low-frequency concentrated valley as a canonical fingerprint. The sample therefore has real similarity to label_1 as well \u2014 notably because the main discriminative block (deep trough at low frequencies) is present in both labels.\\n- Key discriminating observations (that favor label_0 when shared features are down-weighted):\\n  \u2022 The trough here is broad and very smooth (low volatility), and the recovery hump is sustained and low-frequency-dominant \u2014 the label_0 descriptions stress such broad low-frequency trough+smooth recovery as a typical signature. \\n  \u2022 The sample lacks an initial early sharp positive transient (t\u22648) that many label_1 references show; this absence reduces support for label_1 relative to label_0.\\n  \u2022 The late spike, while present in both label lists, in this sample is low-frequency-dominant with only modest intermediate-frequency spread; label_1 late spikes that strongly include intermediate-frequency energy (jitter/broadband) are less similar than the label_0 late-spike examples given in the summaries.\\n- Conclusion from matching: After discounting the shared valley\u2192recovery motif (which is a known source of model confusion), the more discriminative combination present is 'broad smooth early-to-mid trough (low-frequency-dominant) + smooth sustained mid recovery hump + late low-frequency spike' \u2014 this combination aligns more strongly with the label_0 template in the provided summaries.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Combine evidence, compare with the three assistants and the black-box, and provide final classification + alternative:\\n- Black-box model predicted label_1 (logits indicate a higher score for label_1). This is consistent with the known tendency to over-rely on the shared low-frequency valley\u2192recovery motif as evidence for label_1 in borderline cases.\\n- The three independent assistant analyses (Rounds 1\u20133) all concluded label_0 (scores 3\u20134) after careful inspection. Their rationales match mine: they emphasize the broad, smooth trough, the absence of an early positive transient, the sustained low-frequency recovery hump, and a late spike compatible with label_0 examples. They also noted the black-box bias and that raw morphological similarity to label_1 can mislead an automated classifier.\\n- My judgement balances: 1) the objective extracted features (amplitudes, timing, STFT low-frequency concentration), 2) the provided canonical feature summaries for both labels, and 3) the admonition that the sample is a boundary case prone to black-box misclassification. Given that, the evidence more strongly supports label_0 because (a) the trough and recovery are broad and low-frequency-dominant (label_0-typical), (b) there is no early positive transient that often accompanies label_1 examples, and (c) the late spike\u2019s spectral signature fits label_0 examples in the dataset. Therefore the final classification I assign is label_0 (myocardial infarction event).\\n- Alternative / secondary plausible label: label_1 is a reasonable alternative because the core valley\u2192recovery\u2192late spike motif is shared and the STFT shows the canonical strong low-frequency valley that many label_1 references use for classification; thus an automated model might validly predict label_1 and that remains the principal alternative.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Verification of reasoning, potential pitfalls and final check:\\n- Verified I did not rely solely on the shared low-frequency trough\u2192recovery motif (the known misclassification trigger). Instead I emphasized discriminative details: broadness and smoothness of trough and recovery, absence of early positive transient, and the spectral compactness of the late spike \u2014 all of which are better aligned with the label_0 reference descriptions.\\n- Confirmed that intermediate/high-frequency jitter is minimal in this sample; thus atypical high-frequency signatures (which would contradict label_0) are not present.\\n- Cross-checked consistency with the three assistants\u2019 careful analyses (they reached label_0 after the same reasoning) and found agreement.\\n\\nFinal statement (concise): The sample should be classified as label_0. The black-box predicted label_1 (likely due to over-reliance on the shared valley\u2192recovery motif). An alternative plausible label is label_1 (boundary-case ambiguity), but on balance and after discounting the shared confounding features, label_0 is the most consistent assignment for the extracted features.\"\n  ]\n}"

Smooth shape (low visible high-frequency jitter) compared with other peaks in the dataset.  \\n  - Early\u2013mid stage (t \u2248 8\u201340): the signal crosses baseline and descends to a broad, deep negative trough centered \u2248 t 34\u201338 with minimum \u2248 -2.0 to -2.2. The trough is wide (many time-steps), smooth and low-volatility (no large rapid oscillations inside the trough).  \\n  - Mid recovery (t \u2248 40\u201355): steady, relatively smooth recovery from the trough, crossing y=0 roughly around t\u224850\u201352 with a steep-ish but smooth upward slope.  \\n  - Late stage (t \u2248 55\u201395): sustained modest positive hump/plateau with values \u2248 0.2\u20130.8 and only small fluctuations; no very large abrupt late spike (>+3) and no sharp post-spike rebound.\\n\\n- Time\u2013frequency (STFT) observations:\\n  - High energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency row(s) (near 0 Hz) during the early positive transient (0\u20138), during the deep trough (\u224810\u201340) and during the recovery (\u224842\u201360).  \\n  - Very limited energy in intermediate-frequency rows (\u22480.1\u20130.3); intermediate-frequency bands show only weak, localized magnitude (no broad upward spread).  \\n  - Upper/high-frequency rows (>~0.3) show near-zero contributions.\\n\\n- Summary of extracted feature manifestations:\\n  - Early sharp positive transient: amplitude ~+2.0\u2013+2.4, short duration, smooth (low jitter), low-frequency-dominated.  \\n  - Broad deep negative trough: amplitude ~-2.0 to -2.2, long duration, smooth, dominant low-frequency energy.  \\n  - Smooth recovery crossing baseline ~t50 and sustained low-amplitude positive plateau thereafter.  \\n  - Overall low-frequency-dominant time-frequency signature; little intermediate/high-frequency spread (i.e., low jitter).  \\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Which features could cause black-box confusion / why this is a boundary case:\\n\\n- Shared canonical motif: both label_0 and label_1 reference summaries describe the core sequence: an early positive bump/transient \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery to a positive hump/plateau. That morphological overlap (valley + recovery) is the primary reason many models confuse these classes.  \\n- Specific ambiguous elements in this sample that mimic label_1 characteristics: the deep negative trough centered on similar time steps and the subsequent recovery to a plateau are exactly the signature that label_1 uses as its canonical feature. Because the trough is the dominant event here, a classifier that overly weights trough-related low-frequency energy could favor label_1.  \\n- Features that reduce ambiguity here: the strong, relatively large and smooth early positive transient (amplitude ~+2.0\u2013+2.4) and the minimal intermediate-frequency spread (i.e., lack of jitter) are more characteristic of label_0 references in the provided summaries. Label_1 examples often include either more intermediate-frequency spread during transitions or often show prominent late spikes in several reference samples \u2014 neither is present here.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching extracted features to the label summaries (preliminary judgment while avoiding misleading cues):\\n\\n- Match with label_0 (myocardial infarction event) typical features:\\n  - Early sharp positive transient (t \u2272 8, amplitude consistent) \u2014 present and matches label_0 typical signature.  \\n  - Early-to-mid broad deep negative valley (t \u2248 8\u201330/40, amplitude ~-2.0) \u2014 present and low-frequency-dominant, matching label_0.  \\n  - Mid recovery positive hump (t\u224830\u201360) and late sustained plateau \u2014 present and smooth, matching label_0 descriptions.  \\n  - Time-frequency: concentrated energy at lowest-frequency rows for the main events \u2014 consistent with label_0 typical features.\\n  => Overall: a high degree of correspondence with label_0 canonical fingerprints.\\n\\n- Match with label_1 (normal heartbeat) typical features:\\n  - Label_1 also lists early small positive transient \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 plateau as common. The sample indeed shares those core components, especially the deep trough and recovery, which explains why classifiers can confuse the labels.  \\n  - Differences vs typical label_1 examples: many label_1 examples in the summary include stronger intermediate-frequency spread (jitter) at transitions or notable late spikes in some samples; the test sample lacks these label_1-favoring characteristics.  \\n  => Overall: moderate similarity to label_1 but fewer of the distinguishing label_1 micro-features.\\n\\n- Critical methodological point followed: because the dataset and prior assistants warned that the black-box tends to mislabel similar signals as label_1, I do not treat the model\u2019s confusion as independent evidence for label_1. Instead I weigh morphological micro-features (early transient amplitude and frequency-distribution detail) that are more discriminative.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against black-box and other assistants, and form final decision:\\n\\n- Other assistants: three independent analyses (Rounds 1\u20133) extracted similar features and all concluded label 0 with high similarity scores; they emphasized the same discriminative points: (1) large/sharp early positive transient, (2) broad deep trough, (3) smooth low-frequency-dominant recovery without a large late spike. Their reasoning aligns with my extracted features.\\n- Black-box model: predicted label 0 (logits given: [0.36656689643859863, -1.8807108402252197]). The model's predicted class matches our reasoned decision. Note: despite the warning that the black-box can be biased toward label_1 for some boundary cases, in this particular instance it also predicted label_0 \u2014 consistent with the discriminative evidence present. Classification accuracies per class are high, indicating the model overall performs well, but we remain cautious because shared motifs cause boundary ambiguity.\\n- Final judgement: label 0 is the best-supported classification. Primary reasons:\\n  1) Presence of a pronounced, smooth early positive transient of substantial amplitude (\u2248+2.0\u2013+2.4) that is a defining typical feature in label_0 examples;  \\n  2) A broad, low-frequency-dominant deep negative trough (\u2248-2.0 to -2.2) matching label_0 timing and energy concentration;  \\n  3) A smooth recovery crossing baseline around t\u224850 and settling into a modest plateau with little intermediate/high-frequency jitter \u2014 again aligning with label_0 typical signatures and lacking label_1-typical micro-features (notably a pronounced late spike or higher jitter spread).  \\n- Alternative result: label 1 is a plausible alternative (moderate similarity) because the canonical valley\u2192recovery morphology is shared. If a classifier strongly prioritizes the trough-only low-frequency signature and ignores the early spike amplitude/timing or the absence of late-spike/jitter features, it could choose label 1. However, given the discriminative micro-features present, label 0 is the more accurate classification here.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Verification and final statement:\\n\\n- Re-check for possible overlooked pattern: the STFT shows no substantial intermediate-frequency energy during transitions, and no late >+3 spike is present; these absences reduce support for label_1. The discriminating early spike magnitude and the smooth, low-vigilance trough/recovery pattern are consistent across line plot and STFT evidence.  \\n- Conclusion: classify Test sample 59 as label 0 (myocardial infarction event) as the primary result. Alternative plausible classification is label 1 only because of the shared valley\u2192recovery morphology, but secondary evidence (early spike amplitude and lack of intermediate-frequency spread or late spike) favors label 0.\\n\\nFinal decision: result = label 0 (primary). Model prediction = label 0. Alternative label (lower confidence): label 1 (due to shared core morphology but less supported by the micro-features).\"\n  ]\n}"

The STFT signature for label_0 is low-frequency (0Hz) dominance for those events, with intermediate-frequency spread mainly during rapid transitions. The sample's features match these points closely (early sharp positive, broad DC trough of similar magnitude and duration, low-frequency-dominant recovery to sustained plateau). The small intermediate-frequency spread during the transition is also described in the label_0 summary as a common, sometimes-ambiguous component. This is a high-quality match.\\n\"\n        \"- Comparison with label_1 summary: label_1 also lists the general sequence early positive bump \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery/hump \u2192 late plateau/spike as a consistent pattern across many samples, and the model often treats the deep valley + recovery low-frequency block as typical for label_1 as well. Thus the sample shares several features with label_1 (notably the deep low-frequency trough and the recovery plateau). However, the distinguishing cues that align more strongly to label_0 in the provided summaries are (a) the prominent early sharp positive transient amplitude/timing combined with (b) a DC-like mid trough that the label_0 examples often present together (the combination in the reference label_0 examples matches the sample very closely). The sample's mid trough shows some ambiguous adjacent low-mid frequency patches (as noted in the background analysis) which is characteristic of label_0 boundary cases where the model may become confused.\\n\"\n        \"- Similarity scoring (explaining the chosen score = 4 for the predicted label and relative similarity to both labels):\\n\"\n        \"  * label_0 similarity = 4 (High similarity). Rationale: \u226580% of the main label_0 features are present and closely match in temporal location, amplitude ranges, morphology (sharp early spike, broad DC trough, smooth recovery to plateau), and STFT low-frequency dominance. Reference samples labelled 0 (Samples 43, 19, 14, 2) display nearly identical tri-phasic shapes and very-low-frequency STFT energy patterns. The combination and sequencing are essentially the same.\\n\"\n        \"  * label_1 similarity = 3 (Moderate similarity). Rationale: label_1's canonical description also includes deep trough + recovery and occasionally late spikes, and the low-frequency energy concentration during the trough is typical for label_1 references. The sample therefore shares multiple features with label_1 (\u22653 matches), but the detailed combination and the specific morphology (particularly the timing and shape of the early spike + broad trough) align more precisely with label_0 examples.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and model-confusion note:\\n\"\n        \"- Reference comparison: the four similar reference samples (all labeled 0) show nearly identical shapes: early high positive transient ~t=2\u20139, broad mid trough across ~t~20\u201345 with minima around \u22122 to \u22122.4 in some refs, and a recovery to a late positive plateau. Their STFTs show concentrated energy at 0Hz for these windows and modest adjacent spread during transitions. Our test sample matches these reference label_0 patterns visually and in STFT signature.\\n\"\n        \"- Dissimilar references: the provided dissimilar sample with label 1 (Sample 1) has different timing and frequency distribution (more mid-to-late high-frequency and different peak placement), and sample 23 (label 0) is also different in its late-stage shape \u2014 these confirm that not all label_0 or label_1 items are identical, but the best-matching cluster for the test sample is the label_0 group.\\n\"\n        \"- Model confusion / boundary behavior: the background and other assistants noted this tri-phasic arrangement (early spike + broad trough + late plateau) is a typical boundary configuration that can cause the black-box to flip labels. The test sample contains exactly those boundary-like ambiguous cues (especially the mixed/patchy contribution in adjacent low-to-mid frequencies during the trough\u2192recovery). That explains why an automated model might be uncertain or misclassify. Nevertheless, when using the supplied expert pattern lists and checking visually against labeled references, the balance of morphology and STFT evidence supports label_0 strongly.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Final conclusion: the sample's dominant feature pattern (early sharp positive transient + broad, DC-dominated mid negative trough + smooth, steep recovery to a sustained late positive plateau, with STFT dominated by 0Hz energy and only modest transition frequency spread) matches the label_0 profile at a high level. I therefore classify this sample as label 0 (myocardial infarction event). Similarity score to predicted label_0: 4 (high). I also note moderate similarity to label_1 (score ~3) which explains why a black-box classifier may be confused on this boundary example.\"\n    ]\n}"

Per the provided summaries, such mixed low-to-mid frequency contributions are precisely the type of signal content that has caused the black-box to be uncertain or to flip labels in boundary examples.\\n\"\n    \"- Transition frequency spread: modest spread into adjacent low-mid frequencies during the trough\u2192recovery ramp could be interpreted differently by different models/decision rules \u2014 sometimes counted as a typical transition for label 0, sometimes flagged as atypical for one label and therefore pushing the decision toward the other.\\n\"\n    \"- Absence of decisive high-frequency jitter: there is little high-frequency energy, which removes one potential disambiguator; that also increases the risk of confusion because both classes rely mainly on low-frequency signatures.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match of sample features to label summaries, avoiding taking confounding features as sole evidence:\\n\"\n    \"- Similarities to label 0 (myocardial infarction in dataset summaries): pronounced early sharp positive transient (t\u22648), broad DC-dominated mid trough, recovery into a mid/late positive hump or plateau \u2014 all of which are present here with matching timing and amplitude ranges. The STFT low-frequency dominance across the main events aligns well with the label_0 typical signature. The modest frequency spread during recovery is described in label_0 summaries as a common transition trait (sometimes ambiguous), so it does not contradict label_0.\\n\"\n    \"- Similarities to label 1 (normal heartbeat in summaries): label_1 examples also often show early bump \u2192 deep valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 late plateau/spike, and the model descriptions emphasize that the deep low-frequency trough and recovery are typical for label_1 as well. Thus the macro-morphology alone cannot rule out label_1 \u2014 this is the core reason these instances are boundary cases.\\n\"\n    \"- Crucial discriminating observation: the combination of a distinct, short-duration early positive spike of ~+2.0 combined with a broad, DC-like trough of the observed magnitude and the particular timing/shape of the late plateau closely matches multiple reference examples labeled 0 in the provided material. The ambiguous element (mixed SHAP during the trough) is recognized as a boundary cue and should not dominate the final decision by itself. When not overweighting that ambiguous attribution, the cumulative evidence (timing, amplitude, low-frequency dominance at the three main events and close match to labeled-0 references) favors label 0.\\n\"\n    \"- Therefore preliminary judgment (without over-relying on ambiguous trough attribution): features more strongly align with label 0 while acknowledging nontrivial similarity to label 1.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Reconcile with black-box and other assistants, state final classification and alternatives:\\n\"\n    \"- Three independent assistants all concluded label 0 with high similarity scores and provided nearly identical feature analyses; their reasoning matches the extracted features above and points to high similarity with labeled-0 reference examples.\\n\"\n    \"- The black-box model also predicts label 0 and produces logits that place substantially more mass on label 0 (logits: [0.8954, -2.5004]), indicating the model is, for this sample, leaning clearly toward label 0 rather than label 1.\\n\"\n    \"- Given: (a) the explicit tri-phasic morphology and amplitude/timing match to label_0 references, (b) the STFT low-frequency dominance consistent with label_0 main events, (c) the black-box and multiple human analyses agreeing, and (d) the ambiguous SHAP trough region treated as a boundary cue rather than definitive evidence \u2014 the most reasonable final classification is label 0.\\n\"\n    \"- Alternative / caveat: label 1 remains a plausible alternative because label_1 shares the fundamental valley\u2192recovery morphology and low-frequency trough signature. The main source of alternative plausibility is the mixed/weak attribution over the mid trough and the shared low-frequency pattern. If new information (e.g., ground-truth label or additional clinical features) contradicts the label_0 match, label_1 would be the first alternative to re-evaluate.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Step 5 \u2014 Verification and final statement:\\n\"\n    \"- I reviewed the feature extraction, boundary-causing elements, and class-summary matches to ensure ambiguous features were not overweighted.

The aggregate morphological, amplitude and time-frequency evidence, plus agreement across multiple analyses and the black-box, support label 0.\\n\"\n    \"- Final classification: label 0 (myocardial infarction event).

Our sample matches that combination closely in timing, amplitude and STFT/DC signature.\\n\"\n        \"- The SHAP colors reinforce this mapping: the early positive peak and the late plateau are strongly red (typical) while the mid trough shows a mixed signature (some 0 Hz red in central subwindow but blue in adjacent low-frequency bins). This mix is exactly the kind of temporal imbalance called out in the pattern list where early/late typical low-frequency evidence can outweigh atypical DC-like windows or produce boundary behavior.\\n\"\n        \"- Therefore the sample fits the described label_0 misclassification pattern and is highly likely to be one of the typical boundary/misclassified samples. Based on the SHAP magnitudes seen, the net effect is that the red (positive) contributions from the early spike and the late plateau will likely produce a net positive logit contribution for label 0 that outweighs the mixed/negative contributions from the trough. Rough approximate interpretation of logits for such a boundary sample: positive SHAP mass from early+late windows ~+0.5 to +0.9 (supporting label 0) versus negative/mixed mid-trough contributions ~-0.1 to -0.4, yielding a net margin that typically leads the black-box to predict label 0 with a moderate-to-strong margin.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Conclusion: This sample strongly matches the label_0 misclassification pattern (early positive spike + mid trough + late plateau) and is therefore judged highly likely to be a typical misclassification case for label 0.\"\n    ]\n}",

There is also red in the low-frequency rows during the mid-recovery and parts of the later plateau (again treated as typical by the model).\\n  - Intermediate-frequency rows (mid-frequency): several time blocks (especially during transitions) show light-blue / mixed blue coloring \u2014 indicating the model treats higher-frequency / jitter-like components in these regions as atypical or ambiguous.\\n  - High-frequency rows (upper rows): mostly neutral/very faint colors (not informative).\\n\\n- Determination of whether each extracted feature is typical/atypical according to the heatmap:\\n  - Early sharp positive transient (t\u22482\u20138): low-frequency cells corresponding to this window are red \u2192 typical feature.\\n  - Early-to-mid deep negative valley (t\u224810\u201342): very-low-frequency cells are strongly red \u2192 typical feature (primary canonical marker).\\n  - Mid recovery / positive hump (t\u224843\u201360): low-frequency cells show red/light-red \u2192 typical or weakly typical.\\n  - Late sustained elevated plateau and moderate peaks (t\u224860\u201395): low-frequency rows for this window show light-red in places \u2192 generally typical (supportive), while intermediate-frequency components of the late fluctuations are sometimes blue \u2192 those high-frequency components are atypical.\\n  - Any intermediate-frequency jitter present during transitions: these are marked blue \u2192 atypical / ambiguous.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern summary for the sample:\\n- The sample contains the canonical sequence: an early sharp positive transient (typical, low-frequency red) followed by a broad, deep negative trough (typical, very-strong low-frequency red), then a smooth recovery crossing baseline and a sustained positive plateau with moderate late peaks (low-frequency cells mostly red or light-red = typical). The only atypical elements are localized intermediate-frequency spreads/jitters during some transitions (colored blue in the heatmap), but they are minor compared to the dominant low-frequency events. In short: dominant low-frequency early spike + dominant low-frequency broad trough + low-frequency recovery/plateau \u2014 most such low-frequency components are marked as typical by the heatmap.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 summaries include the morphological sequence early positive transient \u2192 broad deep trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 late plateau/spike, and both say the model considers the deep low-frequency valley and recovery as core typical features (low-frequency red). Therefore, the basic waveform alone is not uniquely discriminative.\\n- Inspecting the provided label descriptions for distinguishing tendencies:\\n  - Label 0 (myocardial infarction event) description emphasizes: early sharp positive transient + broad deep negative valley + mid recovery hump dominated by low-frequency energy; intermediate-frequency spread during transitions is often atypical. That matches very closely the observed sample pattern and the SHAP markings (dominant low-frequency red spanning the early spike, trough and recovery; intermediate-frequency blue for transition jitter).\\n  - Label 1 (normal heartbeat) also lists the sequence and notes the deep valley low-frequency block as a canonical feature; however some label_1 examples included small oddities such as isolated blue at the absolute 0 Hz row in some samples or larger late spikes. The sample\u2019s heatmap here shows strong, consistent red in the very-low-frequency rows for the early spike, trough and recovery \u2014 this strong and consistent low-frequency red signature across those phases is more aligned with the label_0 reference descriptions (and reference sample 1) in which the combination of early sharp positive transient + large broad trough + smooth recovery is the prototypical typical signature.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision:\\n- Reference sample 1 (Label 0) is visually very similar to sample 65: early high positive transient (~+2.2\u2013+2.6), deep trough around -1.5 to -1.8, then recovery and sustained positive plateau; its STFT/low-frequency energy distribution and (implied) heatmap emphasis on very-low-frequency during early/trough/recovery matches sample 65 closely.\\n- Reference sample 2 (Label 1) also shows the valley\u2192recovery pattern, but it exhibits more pronounced high-amplitude negative excursion and somewhat more jagged intermediate-frequency content in the trough region in the reference; sample 65's heatmap shows stronger, consistently red low-frequency marking for the early/trough/recovery windows which resembles the label_0 reference signature more strongly.\\n\\nFinal classification and similarity scoring:\\n- I classify sample 65 as label 0. The primary reasons:\\n  1) The waveform sequence (early sharp positive transient + broad deep trough + smooth recovery + sustained plateau) exactly matches the canonical description for label_0 in the provided summary;\\n  2) The SHAP heatmap marks the very-low-frequency rows (0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows) as strongly red across the early spike and trough and through the recovery \u2014 the label_0 summary repeatedly notes that this low-frequency dominance across these phases is the model\u2019s typical signature for label_0;\\n  3) Intermediate-frequency jitter is present but marked blue (atypical), which is exactly the behavior listed for label_0 (model treats jitter as less typical and sometimes atypical) and thus does not contradict label_0 assignment.\\n- Similarity scores (1\u20134):\\n  - Similarity to label 0: 4 (High similarity). Rationale: The main features (early sharp positive transient, broad deep negative trough, mid recovery and late plateau) are present and their low-frequency components are strongly red in the heatmap. The overall morphology and the distribution of typical/atypical frequency contributions closely match the label_0 pattern and the provided reference sample 1.\\n  - Similarity to label 1: 3 (Moderate similarity). Rationale: The waveform sequence also matches label_1\u2019s canonical valley\u2192recovery pattern, and label_1 descriptions treat deep low-frequency valleys as typical. However, the consistency and strength of low-frequency red across the early spike+trough+recovery in sample 65 align more with the label_0 exemplars; moreover intermediate-frequency blue in transitions is more explicitly described as atypical for label_0 in the supplied text, making label_0 a slightly better match.\\n\\nConclusion: label 0 (myocardial infarction event) with high confidence. The dominant very-low-frequency energy across the early spike, broad trough, and recovery is treated as typical by the model (red SHAP), matching the label_0 canonical signature; intermediate-frequency jitter is present but marked atypical (blue) and does not overturn the low-frequency evidence.\"\n    ]\n}",

Both labels therefore can appear similar at a coarse morphological level.\\n- Distinguishing cues from the summaries:\\n  - Label_0 examples emphasize an early sharp positive transient (t\u22648) and then a deep trough and recovery; late-stage behavior for label_0 can be a minor plateau or sometimes a late spike (sample-dependent). The summary for label_0 notes that dominant low-frequency large-amplitude deviations (early spike + broad negative valley + recovery hump) are typical (red) while intermediate-frequency jitter is atypical.\\n  - Label_1 examples also emphasize the deep valley as the key canonical feature and often note that a late large positive spike can be typical for some label_1 samples. Label_1's canonical fingerprint also depends strongly on the low-frequency trough and recovery.\\n- For sample 65, the most discriminative observations are:\\n  - The early positive transient is pronounced and marked typical by SHAP (this aligns well with label_0 descriptions that highlight an early sharp positive transient as a typical event for label_0).\\n  - The trough is broad, low-frequency and strongly red in SHAP \u2014 this is strongly typical for both labels, but combined with a pronounced early sharp positive transient the pattern matches label_0 reference descriptions very closely.\\n  - There is no very large late positive spike (>3.0) which some label_1 examples present as a distinctive typical event; rather we see a moderate sustained plateau \u2014 this matches many label_0 examples (and some label_1 ones) but does not support label_1's distinguishing late huge-spike pattern.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 verification against given reference samples and final decision:\\n- Reference sample 1 (Label 0, sample 90) is visually and temporally very similar to sample 65: both show a pronounced early positive spike (t\u22480\u20138), a broad deep trough (t\u224815\u201345) and a recovery to a moderate positive plateau; their STFT/SHAP patterns show red low-frequency importance across the same time blocks. This closeness reinforces a label_0 classification.\\n- Reference sample 2 (Label 1, sample 5) also follows the valley\u2192recovery pattern but exhibits more mid/late irregularities and in some variants a more ambiguous early transient and pronounced mid-frequency components. Sample 65's SHAP emphasis on the early sharp transient + trough + recovery (low-freq red) aligns more closely with label_0 references than with the distinctive label_1 variants that include very large late spikes or stronger mid-frequency ambiguity.\\n\\nFinal classification decision and similarity scoring:\\n- Chosen label: label 0.\\n- Similarity quantification (per instruction, scores 1..4):\\n  - Similarity to label_0: 4 (High similarity). Rationale: Sample 65 matches the main label_0 signature \u2014 a pronounced early sharp positive transient, a broad low-frequency trough, and a low-frequency recovery/hump; the SHAP heatmap shows these low-frequency components are strongly red (typical) and intermediate-frequency jitter is marked atypical \u2014 this is the same weighting described for label_0 examples and matches reference sample 90 closely.\\n  - Similarity to label_1: 3 (Moderate similarity). Rationale: The core valley\u2192recovery morphology and low-frequency typicality also appear in label_1 descriptions, so there are multiple matches. However, a notable distinguishing element (very large late spike or different SHAP emphasis found in some label_1 examples) is missing. The pronounced early sharp transient being strongly typical in SHAP and the overall match to the label_0 reference tilts the decision toward label_0 rather than label_1.\\n\\nConclusion: Based on the detailed mapping of line-plot events to STFT energy and to SHAP typical/atypical markings, sample 65 most closely matches the label_0 pattern (high similarity). The model\u2019s heatmap shows the sample\u2019s main slow components (early spike, broad trough, recovery plateau) are treated as typical features (red) \u2014 the combination and sequence best aligns with the label_0 examples and reference sample 90.\"\n    ]\n}",

The mid-phase DC-dominant negative trough is the temporally largest and highest-energy event in STFT but is flagged as atypical by SHAP (blue) whereas the early spike is flagged as typical (red).

In the provided patterns (IDs 2, 6, 35, etc.) the atypical DC-like mid trough dominates and drives the black-box to predict the opposite class (i.e., a label_0 (MI) sample being pushed toward label_1 (normal)).\\n- Therefore the sample is highly likely to be a typical boundary/misclassification case consistent with the label_0 misclassification group.\\n- Approximate model output behavior (qualitative/logit estimate): because the mid-trough 0Hz blue region produces a sizeable negative SHAP contribution for label_0 and the early/late red regions are insufficient to offset it, the black-box would typically favor the other class (predict label_1). A plausible numeric characterization is a moderate-to-strong margin in favor of label_1 \u2014 e.g., class\u20111 logit higher by roughly 1.5\u20133.0 (corresponding roughly to predicted probability in the ~0.82\u20130.95 range for the incorrect class), depending on model calibration.

This yields a time-frequency signature of large low-frequency (DC) blocks coincident with the major deflections and little broadband energy.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching this sample pattern to the provided label feature lists; per-label similarity reasoning:\\n- Commonality: Both label_0 and label_1 feature lists include the canonical sequence early positive transient \u2192 deep low-frequency negative trough \u2192 recovery to positive plateau. Many specific numeric ranges overlap between labels (early spike amplitude up to \u2248+3.3; trough depths to \u2248-2.6; recovery humps \u22480.2\u20131.2). Therefore both labels match many features of this sample.\\n- Discriminating observations favoring label 0:\\n  1. Early spike amplitude & morphology: the sample's very large, sharp early transient (\u2248+3.0) is strongly consistent with the label_0 description of an \\\"early sharp positive transient\\\" (label_0 emphasizes short steep peak with little high-frequency jitter). While label_1 can show an early bump, label_1 descriptions often call it a \\\"small positive transient\\\" (and several label_1 examples with early bumps have slightly smaller or less sharp morphology). The size and sharpness here align more closely with label_0 prototypes.\\n  2. Mid trough frequency content and smoothness: the mid trough is a sustained DC-like negative offset with very strong 0Hz energy and minimal intermediate-frequency spread. Label_0 examples emphasize dominant low-frequency energy for deep valleys (typical), and label_0 descriptions note that intermediate-frequency jitter is often atypical. Our sample's trough lacks jitter and is DC-dominated \u2014 characteristic of the label_0 typical signature.\\n  3. Lack of a large late abrupt spike: several label_1 reference examples and the label_1 description note that a late large positive spike (t\u224886\u201392) can be characteristic of many label_1 samples; our sample does not show a comparable late large spike or rapid post-spike rebound. The absence of that late-stage label_1-supporting feature reduces similarity to label_1.\\n- Confounding detail (why the black-box model may have misclassified it): the SHAP/heatmap interpretation noted by other assistants showed the model marking the mid-trough 0Hz bin as atypical (blue) which can mislead a classifier toward label_1 in some cases. However, the raw STFT here shows clear DC energy at the trough (a physically meaningful myocardial feature); the SHAP blue marking appears to be a model-specific artifact rather than absence of the underlying low-frequency feature. In short, the model's internal weighting of that 0Hz cell created confusion, but the signal characteristics themselves match label_0 prototypical signatures.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against the provided reference samples and final quantitative similarity assessment:\\n- Comparison to similar reference samples:\\n  * Similar sample 1 (Label 0, sample 7) is extremely close in morphology and STFT: a large early spike (~+2.5 to +3), a broad deep trough to ~-2.2, and a smooth recovery plateau; its STFT shows the same concentrated DC energy during the trough. This close match supports label_0.\\n  * Similar samples labeled 1 (samples 58, 40, 26) share many features (early bump, deep trough, recovery plateau) and therefore look similar; however, many of the label_1 examples include either more intermediate-frequency spread during transitions or occasional late spikes in the late window \u2014 features absent or weak here. This explains why the sample is a boundary/cross-over case but still slightly more consistent with label_0.\\n  * Dissimilar label_0 references (samples 53, 93) show positive early behavior but different trough magnitudes or differing STFT spreads \u2014 these are less like our test sample, reinforcing that some label_0 cases vary; but the very close match to sample 7 (label_0) is the stronger evidence.\\n- Final similarity scoring (1\u20134) to each label based on matching of the main features:\\n  * label 0 similarity = 4 (High similarity): The sample matches the main label_0 features (large early sharp transient, DC-dominated broad trough, smooth recovery to plateau) including close similarity to a labeled-0 reference (sample 7). >80% of the prototypical label_0 feature set is present.\\n  * label 1 similarity = 3 (Moderate similarity): Many core features are shared (early transient, deep trough, recovery), so similarity is substantial. However, absence of a late large spike and the particularly DC-dominated trough with minimal intermediate-frequency spread makes the sample a somewhat better fit to label_0 than to the most typical label_1 examples.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification summary:\\n- Prediction: label 0. Rationale: although this sample is a boundary case (features are similar to both classes), the combination of a very large, sharp early positive transient, a broad smooth DC-dominated mid trough (strong 0Hz energy with minimal jitter), and a smooth recovery into a low-amplitude plateau more closely matches the label_0 prototypical pattern and its closest label_0 reference. The black-box model's internal attribution (SHAP blue at the trough's 0Hz bin) likely produced a misleading penalty on a key DC trough cell and drove the model toward label_1; accounting for the raw STFT and morphological evidence corrects that misclassification and supports label_0.\\n\\nPer-requested numeric summary (again): label_0 similarity = 4, label_1 similarity = 3.\"\n    ]\n}"

Observed explanation/SHAP artifact reported by other assistants: the SHAP/heatmap mapping reportedly showed the early transient cells marked red (typical), but the mid-trough 0Hz cell(s) were blue-dominant (model-marked atypical) in those particular attribution maps, even though the raw STFT shows strong DC energy there.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Boundary-sample analysis: which features can cause misclassification?\\n1. Overlap: Both label_0 and label_1 reference descriptions list the sequence early positive transient \u2192 deep negative trough \u2192 recovery hump/plateau. That morphological overlap is the primary reason this is a boundary case.\\n2. Potentially misleading attribution: the black-box (or its SHAP heatmap) has been observed to emphasize or penalize a single-cell pattern at the 0Hz row (a localized blue mark) within the mid-trough window. If the classifier treats that isolated 0Hz cell as a decisive atypical cue, it can flip the decision toward the other label despite the broader DC-dominant trough. This is a model-specific artifact rather than absence of the DC trough in the signal.\\n3. Other ambiguous features: absence of a late large positive spike (common in many label_1 examples) removes a label_1-specific supporting cue, while the presence of a very large sharp early spike and DC-dominated trough supports label_0. Intermediate-frequency jitter is low here, so jitter-based cues (which are often used to distinguish) are not helpful.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching sample features to label prototypes while avoiding misleading cues:\\n1. Label_0 (myocardial infarction) prototypical cues present in the sample:\\n   - Early sharp positive transient of large amplitude and short duration (explicitly described as a label_0 hallmark).\\n   - Broad early-to-mid deep negative trough with strong DC energy (label_0 typical signature across reference samples).\\n   - Smooth recovery / positive hump or plateau dominated by low frequencies (consistent with label_0 mid/late description).\\n   - Minimal intermediate/high-frequency spread (label_0 typical examples emphasize low-frequency dominance; jitter is atypical for label_0).\\n2. Label_1 (normal) prototypical cues present or absent:\\n   - The canonical valley\u2192recovery morphology in label_1 overlaps with the sample (explains the boundary confusion).\\n   - However, many label_1 examples in the reference set often include either more intermediate-frequency spread in transitions or a late high positive spike (absent here). Also some label_1 references had single-cell 0Hz anomalies that the model treated inconsistently \u2014 again a potential source of model confusion.\\n3. Crucial decision principle: do not let an isolated model-attribution artifact (single blue 0Hz SHAP cell) override the broader, physically meaningful STFT and morphological evidence. The sample's dominant DC trough and very large early spike are genuine signal features matching label_0 prototypes.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Weighing evidence, cross-checks, and final classification:\\n1. Evidence in favor of label_0 (strong):\\n   - Quantitative match on three most discriminative features for label_0: large early sharp positive transient; broad DC-dominated negative trough with amplitude around -2; smooth low-frequency recovery to plateau.\\n   - STFT shows concentrated energy at 0 Hz for the trough (a main label_0 cue in the provided summaries).\\n   - Lack of label_1-supporting late large spike and minimal intermediate-frequency spread (both reduce support for label_1).\\n   - Multiple independent assistant analyses (Rounds 1\u20133) also concluded label_0 with high similarity scores after accounting for the model's SHAP artifact.\\n2. Evidence in favor of label_1 (weak-to-moderate):\\n   - Morphological overlap exists: both labels can exhibit the same sequence (early bump \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery), making the sample borderline.\\n   - The classifier's internal attribution maps (isolated blue at 0Hz) could, in some model runs, push decisions toward label_1. This is model-specific and not a reliable physiological cue.\\n3. Black-box model output and reliability: the provided black-box prediction is label_0 (logits [0.43397, -1.91953] \u2192 predicted 0). That aligns with the signal evidence and the human analyses. Historical tendency of the model to sometimes misclassify similar cases as label_1 (when misled by localized SHAP anomalies) is noted, but here both the raw signal and the ensemble of careful analyses support label_0.\\n4. Final classification and alternative: primary (most reasonable) classification = label 0. Because the sample is a boundary case morphologically, the alternative plausible classification is label 1 if one relied heavily on the model's isolated SHAP blue marking in the 0Hz bin; however, that would risk following an attribution artifact rather than the stronger multi-feature evidence.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Verification and consistency check:\\n1. I rechecked the main discriminants: early spike magnitude & shape; trough depth/duration & DC dominance; absence of late spike; minimal HF spread. All three discriminants point to label_0.\\n2. I ensured not to rely on the single-cell 0Hz SHAP anomaly as decisive. That anomaly has been reported as an artifact that has caused other misclassifications; using the broader STFT and morphology is more robust.\\n3. Cross-consistency: the black-box prediction, the STFT, and three independent assistant analyses converge on label_0 when the SHAP artifact is treated cautiously.\\n4. Conclusion: the most accurate classification for Sample 75 is label 0 (myocardial infarction event). An alternative (less likely) classification is label 1 only if one gives undue weight to the localized model-attribution blue mark at the 0Hz cell; that approach is not recommended because it contradicts the broader spectral and morphological evidence.\"\n  ]\n}"

Morphology: steep rise and relatively fast fall (a short-duration sharp peak).\\n- Early-to-mid stage (t \u2248 8\u201338): Signal crosses baseline and descends into a broad, deep negative trough. Minimum around t\u224834\u201338 with amplitude about \u22122.0 to \u22122.2. Morphology: wide trough (many time steps), smooth descent and slow recovery (low volatility in the trough itself). No large, persistent high-frequency jitter inside the trough.\\n- Mid recovery (t \u2248 40\u201360): A steady recovery from the trough that crosses y=0 near t\u224850 and produces a sustained positive hump/plateau. Peak of the hump roughly in the 0.3\u20130.8 range (moderate amplitude) and is smoother than the initial spike.\\n- Late stage (t \u2248 60\u201395): A low-amplitude plateau with small, low-volatility fluctuations. There are small peaks/jitters but no abrupt late high-amplitude spike (no sharp late spike like some label-1 samples at t\u224886\u201392).\\n- Time\u2013frequency (STFT) observations: High energy is concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows) during the early spike window (t\u22480\u20138), during the trough window (t\u22488\u201340) and during the recovery/hump window (t\u224840\u201375). There is little spread into intermediate/high-frequency rows \u2014 the energy is dominated by very-low-frequency bands, indicating the major events are slow, smooth baseline deviations rather than noisy, jittery events.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern / phase summary:\\n- The sequence of phases is: pronounced early sharp positive transient \u2192 broad deep negative trough (early-to-mid) \u2192 smooth recovery to a sustained positive hump \u2192 late low-amplitude plateau. The dominant time-frequency signature is concentrated energy in the lowest-frequency rows during the major amplitude deviations (early spike, trough, recovery), with minimal intermediate-frequency spread. Overall morphology: spike + deep trough + smooth recovery hump, with slow dynamics (low-frequency) dominating.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature lists and scoring rationale:\\n- Comparison with label_0 (myocardial infarction) feature list: The sample matches the canonical label_0 pattern very well: an early sharp positive transient (label_0 typical), a large early-mid deep negative valley/trough (label_0 typical, amplitude matches the listed \u22121.0 to \u22122.6 range), a mid recovery/positive hump (label_0 typical), and dominant low-frequency energy in these windows (label_0 typical). The absence of significant intermediate-frequency jitter (the STFT shows mainly lowest-frequency energy) also aligns with the label_0 description where the canonical events are low-frequency and smooth. Many of the label_0 reference samples shown (Samples 6, 84, 14, 85) have highly similar morphologies and similar STFT low-frequency concentration. => Strong match.\\n- Comparison with label_1 (normal heartbeat) feature list: Label_1 also has a canonical valley\u2192recovery morphology (the deep trough and recovery hump are common to both labels). That shared valley+recovery shape is why a black-box can confuse the sample with label_1. However, two distinguishing points favor label_0 here: (1) the early positive transient in this sample is large and sharp (\u2248+2.6), which is emphasized as a typical label_0 manifestation in the feature summary (label_1's early transient tends to be smaller or less decisive); (2) label_1 reference STFT patterns often show either a different timing (e.g., a late large spike) or more intermediate-frequency activity in the late window (Sample 1 and Sample 81 show larger intermediate-frequency energy at later times), whereas the test sample's STFT is concentrated in very-low-frequency rows and lacks the late intermediate-frequency spike characteristic of some label_1 examples. => Partial match, but not as convincing as label_0.\\n\\nScoring choice and justification: I assign the sample a high similarity score of 4 for label_0 (chosen label) because the main, discriminative features of label_0 (early sharp positive transient + deep wide trough in early-to-mid window + smooth mid recovery hump + dominant low-frequency energy) are all present and closely match both the amplitude ranges and the STFT signatures described in the label_0 documentation and visible in the label_0 reference samples. The similarity is high across the primary features (>80% match).\\n\\nWhy this is a boundary case and why a black-box model could misclassify it as label_1:\\n- Both labels share the prominent deep trough + recovery hump morphology. A classifier that heavily weights the presence of a valley and recovery (but underweights the magnitude/timing of the early spike and the precise frequency distribution) can lean toward label_1. The test sample's late-stage plateau also visually resembles label_1 late plateaus in some reference images. However, careful attention to the early sharp positive transient amplitude and the strictly low-frequency STFT footprint (indicating smooth large baseline deviations rather than jitter) strongly favor label_0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- Similar reference samples labeled 0 (Samples 6, 84, 14, 85) show the same ordered morphology (early large spike, deep trough around mid-early times, recovery crossing zero around t\u224850, and a smooth positive plateau). Their STFTs also show dominant low-frequency energy in the same windows. The test sample's waveform and STFT align closely with those references in timing, amplitude ranges, and frequency content.\\n- Dissimilar reference samples labeled 1 (Samples 1 and 81) either have different timing (large events later in the trace), more intermediate-frequency energy in late windows, or noticeably different early-transient magnitudes/structures.

Because this sample exhibits that canonical valley+recovery, a classifier that primarily detects that pattern but underweights other discriminants could be ambiguous about label.\\n- Potential ambiguous contributors in this sample:\\n  - The presence of an early positive transient: label_0 references often emphasize a pronounced early positive transient, but label_1 references also list an early small positive transient as common. If a classifier only checks for 'early positive bump' generically (without assessing amplitude/timing precisely), it could conflate the two labels.\\n  - The low-frequency dominance in the trough window: both labels treat the deep trough as a strongly typical low-frequency event. A model that overly weights the trough\u2019s low-frequency block (without considering the early spike magnitude or absence of a late spike) could misclassify.\\n- Non-confounding features (helpful discriminators):\\n  - The magnitude and sharpness of the early transient in this sample (\u2248+2.5\u2013+2.8) is large and sharp, matching label_0 examples more closely than the usually smaller early bumps tied to some label_1 examples.\\n  - The absence of a late large sharp spike (often present in label_1 references) and the scarcity of intermediate-frequency energy in late windows reduce similarity to many label_1 examples.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching extracted sample features to label summaries and weighing discriminative evidence:\\n- Agreement with label_0 summary (myocardial infarction) \u2014 strong points:\\n  - Label_0 typicals: early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20138, large amplitude), early-mid deep negative trough (t\u22488\u201330) dominated by low-frequency energy, mid recovery positive hump, and optional late plateau. The sample has all four elements in timing and amplitude ranges consistent with label_0 references.\\n  - STFT match: label_0 references show concentrated low-frequency energy in early trough and recovery windows; the sample\u2019s STFT matches this (dominant very-low-frequency rows, little intermediate spread).\\n  - Absence of label_1-typical late spike: many label_1 references show an optional later large spike with some intermediate-frequency energy; the sample lacks a late sharp spike, weakening label_1 support.\\n\\n- Agreement with label_1 summary (normal heartbeat) \u2014 ambiguous/partial points:\\n  - Shared valley\u2192recovery morphology: label_1 also lists a deep negative trough and recovery as canonical and shows low-frequency energy in that trough window. The sample\u2019s trough and recovery therefore by themselves match label_1 as well.\\n  - However, label_1 references often either have a smaller early transient or include a pronounced late spike in several examples; the sample\u2019s prominent early spike amplitude and the lack of a late sharp spike reduce the degree of match to typical label_1 patterns.\\n\\n- Discounting the ambiguous features in final matching: Because the valley\u2192recovery is shared across labels and is a known cause of black-box confusion, I do not treat mere presence of a deep trough + recovery as decisive. Instead I emphasize discriminators that separate labels: early transient amplitude/sharpness, presence/absence of late spike, and degree of intermediate-frequency energy. On those discriminators the sample aligns more with label_0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against other assistants\u2019 analyses and the black-box model output:\\n- Other assistants (three rounds) each performed similar feature extraction and all concluded label_0 with high similarity scores (4/4). Their rationales match my extraction: early pronounced positive transient, broad deep trough with minimal jitter, smooth recovery, late subdued plateau.\\n- Black-box model output (provided): predicted label 0 with logits [-0.4046, -1.0444] \u2014 the higher logit corresponds to label_0. Thus the black-box prediction for this sample is label_0 (consistent with the assistants and with the discriminative evidence). Note: background text warned that the black-box can be biased toward label_1 on boundary cases, but for this specific sample the model predicted label_0.\\n- Considering possible misclassification risk: even though the core valley\u2192recovery is shared, the combination of (1) a large, sharp early transient (magnitude and short duration), (2) a broad low-volatility trough with dominant very-low-frequency energy, and (3) absence of any late high-amplitude spike or concentrated intermediate-frequency energy collectively favor label_0. These are the features that are robust against the known black-box confusion.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Final judgement, alternative, and verification:\\n- Primary classification: label 0. Rationale: The sample matches the label_0 archetype across all discriminative dimensions: a pronounced early sharp positive transient of high amplitude, a broad smooth deep trough dominated by very-low-frequency energy, a smooth low-volatility recovery crossing baseline to a sustained positive plateau, and no late sharp spike or strong intermediate-frequency content. The STFT supports low-frequency dominance for the key events, consistent with label_0 typical signatures.\\n- Alternate (less likely) classification: label 1. Reason why it is less likely: label_1 shares the core trough+recovery morphology and thus is a candidate; however, the comparatively large early transient and the lack of late high-frequency spike or notable intermediate-frequency energy make label_1 a weaker match. The valley\u2192recovery alone was intentionally down-weighted as it is a shared feature and a known source of classifier confusion.\\n- Consistency check: All three human assistant analyses and the black-box model agree on label_0 for this sample; independent STFT and waveform inspections substantiate that agreement. I checked that no important label_1-exclusive signature (notably a late large spike with intermediate-frequency spread) appears in the sample; none does.\\n\\nConclusion: The most reasonable and supported classification for the sample is label 0 (myocardial infarction event pattern). The alternative label 1 is possible only if one overweights the shared valley\u2192recovery feature while ignoring the strong early spike amplitude and the absence of a late spike and intermediate-frequency spread \u2014 which would be a known misclassification mode of the black-box. Given the discriminative evidence, label 0 is the correct assignment.\"\n  ]\n}"

That exact situation was described for this sample in other assistants\u2019 analysis.

Label_1 remains a close runner-up (score 3) because both classes legitimately share the valley\u2192recovery pattern in this dataset and many label_1 references look similar, which explains why the black-box tends to predict label_1 in boundary cases.\",\n        \"\",\n        \"Final conclusion (after cross-check):\",\n        \"The strongest, most consistent interpretation of the line plot + STFT is label 0 (myocardial infarction).

Morphology: smooth, low-volatility (broad valley rather than a sharp spike). STFT: concentrated strong energy in the lowest-frequency row(s) during this early window (large DC / very-low-frequency contribution). This is the single largest-magnitude and longest-duration feature in the trace.\\n- Mid phase (t \u2248 30\u201375): A rising transition that crosses y=0 around t\u224828\u201334 and settles into a sustained positive plateau/hump roughly +0.3 to +1.0 lasting many time steps. Morphology: relatively smooth, low volatility during the plateau.

The early trough carries the greatest magnitude and temporal support.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Which features could cause the black-box to misclassify (boundary / ambiguous components):\\n- The black-box / SHAP behavior reported for similar cases shows the early deep DC-like trough sometimes receives an atypical negative attribution (a blue cell) at the absolute lowest-frequency row; locally negative attribution there can disproportionately push the classifier toward label 1 even when the overall morphology corresponds to label 0. That documented artefact is a known misclassification mechanism for this dataset.\\n- The sample\u2019s shared morphology with label_1 (valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 optional late spike) is another source of ambiguity: both classes commonly exhibit a deep low-frequency trough followed by recovery, so STFT alone is not fully discriminative.\\n- Absence of an early small positive transient (commonly present in many label_1 examples) is a discriminating missing feature but may be underweighted by the black-box if it overly focuses on localized SHAP anomalies.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries while avoiding overreliance on misclassified-attribution signals:\\n- Commonalities: The sample matches both label summaries in the sense that both labels often show a deep low-frequency trough, mid recovery, and sometimes a late spike. Thus purely morphological/STFT matching is ambiguous.\\n- Discriminating observations (from the provided feature descriptions):\\n  - Label_0 typical list explicitly includes an early-to-mid broad deep negative valley (t\u22488\u201330) followed by a mid recovery hump and sometimes a late positive peak. The sample\u2019s dominant early trough and low-frequency recovery + late spike align directly with these label_0 characteristics.\\n  - Label_1 descriptions emphasize the canonical sequence that often includes an early small positive transient before the trough; in this sample that early positive bump is absent. While label_1 also contains deep-trough examples, the absence of the common early positive bump and the particular description of label_0 examples that include exactly this trough\u2192recovery\u2192late-peak sequence tilt the evidence toward label_0.\\n- Crucially, we do not accept the black-box\u2019s SHAP artifact (early trough being labeled atypical) as ground truth for class assignment. The published misclassification note warns that that very artefact causes true label_0 samples to be predicted as label_1. Given that warning, the early-trough negative attribution should be treated as a known model bias rather than a reason to prefer label_1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Weighing evidence, comparing to other assistants and the black-box result, and deciding final label(s):\\n- Other assistants (three independent rounds) all concluded label_0 with high similarity scores (4), using the same feature-level reasoning that the dominant early deep trough + mid recovery + late spike pattern is characteristic of label_0 despite overlap with label_1. Their detailed extractions match my observations.\\n- The black-box predicted label_1 (logits [0.0419, 1.2992]) \u2014 consistent with the known failure mode where atypical SHAP attribution on the early low-frequency trough flips the decision. Given the documented bias, this prediction is not decisive for ground-truth labeling.\\n- Final judgment: The preponderance of feature-level evidence (dominant, smooth early deep low-frequency trough; subsequent low-frequency recovery plateau; late positive spike) and the absence of a characteristic early small positive bump favor label_0 (myocardial infarction). Therefore the most reasonable classification is label_0.\\n- Alternative plausible label: label_1 is a viable alternative because many label_1 examples share the valley\u2192recovery\u2192late-spike morphology; this explains why the black-box and some reference examples are similar. But, given the discriminating aspects and the known model bias, label_0 is the stronger match.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Self-check and verification of reasoning against task constraints:\\n- I explicitly extracted and compared time-domain morphology and time-frequency signatures and separated genuine signal features from model-attribution artifacts. I treated the black-box SHAP anomaly as a documented bias (not as evidence of ground truth), per the instructions to avoid being misled by the model\u2019s misclassification patterns. I verified that the dominant, long-duration early trough (largest amplitude and energy) is the principal discriminative element and that it is described as a typical feature of label_0 in the provided summaries. I also acknowledged ambiguity and provided label_1 as the alternative. No decisive canonical feature of label_1 (an early small positive bump) is present to outweigh the label_0-aligned evidence.\\n\\nConclusion: Based on the detailed signal morphology, STFT energy distribution, comparison with the provided label feature dictionaries, and explicit consideration of the black-box misclassification bias, the sample should be classified as label_0 (myocardial infarction). The black-box model predicted label_1 likely due to the known SHAP/attribution artifact on the early trough; label_1 remains a plausible alternative but is less consistent with the dominant features in this trace.\"\n  ]\n}"

STFT: some low-frequency energy present near 0Hz and adjacent low rows. SHAP: predominantly red across several low-frequency rows in the early time window -> judged a typical feature (red) for the model.\n- Transition to mid-phase (t \u2248 8\u201318): crosses zero then begins a persistent descent. STFT: growing low-frequency/0 Hz energy as the signal moves negative. SHAP: around the start of the mid window the 0Hz row already begins to show weak-to-mixed coloring.\n- Mid phase trough (t \u2248 18\u201336): broad, deep negative valley reaching \u2248 -2.0 to -2.3 (sustained, not a narrow spike). STFT: very strong energy concentrated at the 0 Hz row (bright band) and energy in adjacent low-frequency rows. SHAP: the 0Hz row in this mid window is strongly blue (deep negative SHAP), while adjacent low-frequency rows are mixed. Judgment: the mid trough is an atypical feature (blue) in the key 0Hz component; adjacent low-freq rows show mixed/ambiguous contributions.\n- Recovery and late plateau (t \u2248 36\u201395): steady, relatively fast recovery crossing 0 around t\u224842\u201344, then a sustained late positive plateau \u2248 +0.4 to +0.9 with small jitter. STFT: low-frequency/near-DC energy in late window (but weaker than mid trough). SHAP: late window low-frequency rows are largely light-red to near-zero (some red), indicating these late plateau components are mostly typical (red/weak) or at least not strongly negative.\n- Small high-frequency jitter during recovery/plateau: STFT shows little spread into higher frequency rows; SHAP in higher/intermediate rows is patchy and weak (mixed/ambiguous). Judgment: ambiguous but low impact.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature-pattern summary for this sample:\n- Combined pattern: sharp early positive transient (typical/red) + prolonged, large-amplitude mid-phase negative trough (dominant 0Hz energy strongly blue = atypical) + rapid recovery to a sustained late positive plateau (mostly red/typical). Frequency breakdown: 0Hz row is strongly implicated during the mid trough (blue) and early/late windows show low-frequency energy that is red or mixed in adjacent low rows. Net SHAP effect: the deep 0Hz blue region in the mid trough produces a strong negative contribution that outweighs the positive/typical contributions from the early spike and late plateau.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided misclassification patterns and likely model behavior:\n- This sample closely matches the patterns described under the provided \"label_0\" block: early transient positive peak, a broad mid-phase deep negative trough dominated by 0Hz/DC energy (flagged blue in heatmaps), followed by a late positive plateau. The description and the SHAP coloring align: the mid trough is the primary atypical 0Hz signature and early/late windows are partially typical but insufficient to reverse the mid-phase effect.\n- According to the provided pattern summaries, this configuration is a canonical boundary case that the black-box model typically misclassifies as label 0.

STFT: very strong energy concentrated at the 0 Hz row (bright band) and energy in adjacent low-frequency rows.

Frequency breakdown: 0Hz row is strongly implicated during the mid trough (blue) and early/late windows show low-frequency energy that is red or mixed in adjacent low rows. Net SHAP effect: the deep 0Hz blue region in the mid trough produces a strong negative contribution that outweighs the positive/typical contributions from the early spike and late plateau.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided misclassification patterns and likely model behavior:\\n- This sample closely matches the patterns described under the provided \\\"label_0\\\" block: early transient positive peak, a broad mid-phase deep negative trough dominated by 0Hz/DC energy (flagged blue in heatmaps), followed by a late positive plateau. The description and the SHAP coloring align: the mid trough is the primary atypical 0Hz signature and early/late windows are partially typical but insufficient to reverse the mid-phase effect.\\n- According to the provided pattern summaries, this configuration is a canonical boundary case that the black-box model typically misclassifies as label 0. The strong blue 0Hz mid-trough tends to dominate the logit sum and push the model toward predicting label 0 despite the early/late red evidence.\\n\\nApproximate expected logits (qualitative):\\n- For samples with this pattern the model tends to give a positive logit margin for the predicted (misclassified) class (label 0).

STFT concentration at the lowest frequency rows during the trough matches the label_0 time-frequency descriptions (typical/red regions in label_0). Intermediate-frequency spread is minimal \u2014 consistent with label_0 typical examples.\\n- Match to label_1: Many high-level morphological elements overlap (valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 plateau). Label_1 examples likewise show low-frequency troughs and recoveries; some label_1 samples also include late large positive spikes (not present here) or mixed 0Hz anomalies. But the decisive difference is that label_1 examples in the summary sometimes show different intermediate-frequency signatures or isolated 0Hz anomalies; our sample lacks such ambiguous intermediate-frequency energy and instead presents a smooth, concentrated low-frequency trough that aligns more tightly to label_0 references.\\n- Conclusion of matching: when discounting the shared valley\u2192recovery motif (the boundary trap), the detailed time-frequency character (very-strong 0Hz concentration on a broad trough, sharp early spike morphology, smooth recovery to plateau) aligns more with label_0 than with typical label_1 variants.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Consideration of black-box model and other assistants\u2019 results:\\n- Black-box: predicted label 0 (logits: label0 = -0.1298, label1 = -1.2032), i.e., model favored label 0 (higher logit). This numeric output is consistent with a modest margin for label_0.\\n- Other assistants: all three independent analyses concluded label 0 with high similarity scores and provided similar reasoning (matching trough timing, amplitude, and 0Hz STFT energy to label_0 references). They also noted boundary-case ambiguity and risk of misclassification if the classifier overweights certain features; however, none of them concluded label 1.\\n- My synthesis: model and assistants agree on label 0; given the close feature match to label_0 reference patterns and the concentrated low-frequency trough (key discriminative cue), label 0 is the most supported class. The alternative label_1 remains plausible because of shared morphology, so it is explicitly acknowledged as the borderline alternative but less supported here.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Final decision and verification of reasoning:\\n- Final classification: label 0 (myocardial infarction event). Rationale summary: the sample\u2019s defining features are (1) a sharp early positive transient, (2) a broad, deep mid trough dominated by concentrated 0Hz energy (smooth, low volatility), and (3) a rapid recovery into a sustained positive plateau. These detailed time-frequency and morphological characteristics match the typical label_0 examples in the provided summaries more closely than label_1, especially when discounting the boundary trap of the shared valley\u2192recovery motif. The black-box output and three assistant analyses corroborate this conclusion.\\n- Alternative/secondary result: label 1 is a plausible alternative due to shared global morphology; a classifier that weights late-plateau cues or isolated low-frequency anomalies differently could predict label 1. But based on the precise STFT concentration and morphology in this sample, label 0 is the best-supported label.\\n\\nVerification: I explicitly avoided treating the common valley\u2192recovery motif alone as decisive (the known misclassification trap) and prioritized finer-grained distinctions in frequency spread, trough smoothness, and early-peak sharpness that favor label_0. The decision is consistent with STFT evidence, line-plot amplitudes/timings, the black-box logits, and independent assistant analyses.\"\n  ]\n}"

Morphology: steep rise and fall (sharp transient). STFT: concentrated energy at the 0 Hz (DC) row and the lowest-frequency rows in this early window. Volatility: low (smooth transient).  \\n- Mid stage (t \u2248 15\u201345, center \u2248 35\u201343): A broad, sustained negative trough reaching \u2248 -1.6 to -1.8 at the trough center. Morphology: wide, smooth valley (not a narrow spike) with relatively low high-frequency content.

STFT along the slope shows continued low-frequency energy with small vertical spread (adjacent low-frequency rows).  \\n- Late stage (t \u2248 60\u201395): A sustained positive plateau / hump with moderate amplitude roughly +0.2 to +0.7 and only small, short-lived jitter. STFT: low-frequency components dominate here as well; intermediate-frequency content is weak.  \\n- Overall volatility: The trace is dominated by slow, large-amplitude low-frequency events (sharp early positive peak, broad mid trough, smooth recovery) and contains only modest intermediate-frequency spread during transitions. There are no strong, sustained high-frequency components.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern of the sample (phase decomposition and relationships):\\n- Phase A (early): sharp, high-amplitude positive transient (t~0\u20138).  \\n- Phase B (middle): broad, dominant low-frequency negative trough (t~15\u201345), the largest sustained negative excursion in the trace.  \\n- Phase C (late): smooth recovery crossing zero into a modest sustained positive plateau (t>58) with little jitter.  \\n- Important relationships: The sequence is tri-phasic: early sharp positive \u2192 broad mid negative trough \u2192 slow recovery to late positive plateau. The energy is concentrated in the lowest STFT rows throughout the major events, confirming these are slow (low-frequency) morphological features rather than high-frequency noise.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison with label feature summaries and matching score per label:\\n- Match to label_0 (myocardial infarction): High degree of correspondence. Label_0 typical features include: early sharp positive transient (t~0\u20138), early-to-mid broad deep negative valley (t~8\u201330/central early), mid recovery positive hump (t~30\u201360), and possible late sustained elevated plateau. The sample contains all of these core elements with matching timing/amplitudes and dominant low-frequency energy. Key match points: amplitude and timing of the early spike; existence, width and depth of the mid trough; smooth low-frequency recovery and late positive plateau. Similarity score to label_0: 4 (High similarity).\\n- Match to label_1 (normal heartbeat): Moderate similarity. Label_1 reference also shows a canonical sequence (early small positive bump \u2192 pronounced low-frequency deep valley \u2192 recovery to positive plateau \u00b1 late spike). The sample shares that broad valley\u2192recovery morphology and low-frequency dominance, so some features are common to label_1. However, the sample\u2019s early transient is relatively large/sharp (closer to label_0 examples) and the mid-trough characteristics (timing, shape and STFT concentration matching label_0 reference samples) align better with label_0. Also, label_1 examples often show certain late spikes or post-spike rebounds that are more pronounced in some reference label_1 samples \u2014 these are not as prominent here. Similarity score to label_1: 3 (Moderate similarity).\\n- Rationale for selecting label_0 as final: Although both labels share the valley\u2192recovery pattern, the full tri-phasic morphology (very pronounced early sharp positive transient of this amplitude + broad, smooth and deep mid trough + smooth low-frequency recovery into a moderate plateau) matches the label_0 canonical examples very closely. The STFT confirms the major events are low-frequency, consistent with the label_0 typical signatures in the provided summaries and the 4 similar reference samples (Samples 14, 6, 85, 84 labeled 0) \u2014 visually these reference traces and their STFTs show nearly identical timing and frequency-energy patterns to the test sample.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and black-box misclassification risk:\\n- The four similar reference samples labeled 0 show near-identical structure: large early positive peak, deep broad mid negative trough (centered ~30\u201345), and a positive recovery/plateau afterwards. Their STFTs likewise concentrate energy in the lowest-frequency rows during the same windows. The test sample matches those references closely in amplitude, timing, and time-frequency footprint \u2014 reinforcing label_0.\\n- The two dissimilar reference samples labeled 1 exhibit more variable early/late behavior and in some cases stronger intermediate-frequency content or late large spikes that differ from the current sample\u2019s smoother late plateau. This reduces the match to label_1 versus label_0.\\n- Known black-box behavior: The provided analysis and dataset notes indicate that the black-box sometimes misclassifies true label_0 examples as label_1 when a concentrated negative mid-trough produces a particular SHAP/0Hz-cell signal that the model treats as atypical. This test sample contains the same mid-trough 0Hz-dominant signature that has historically driven that misclassification\u2014so the sample is a boundary case where the automated classifier may output label_1. Knowing that, and given the stronger morphological and STFT match to the label_0 references, I judge the correct label is label_0 despite possible black-box predictions otherwise.\\n\\nFinal decision and summary scores:\\n- Final classification: label 0 (true class: myocardial infarction event).  \\n- Overall confidence (single aggregated score): 4 (high).  \\n- Per-label similarity (for clarity): label_0 = 4 (High similarity), label_1 = 3 (Moderate similarity).\\n\\nConcise justification: The test sample exhibits the full tri-phasic waveform (large early positive transient, wide/deep mid negative trough, slow recovery to a late positive plateau) with dominant low-frequency energy at the exact time windows described in the label_0 templates and in multiple label_0 reference samples. These strong morphological + time-frequency matches outweigh the superficial shared traits with label_1 and indicate the sample is best labeled as label_0. Note: the case is a known boundary example likely to trick the black-box classifier, but careful combined line-plot and STFT analysis supports label_0.\"\n  ]\n}",

The sample-to-classify is visually and spectrally almost identical to those label_0 references (consistent low-frequency STFT energy distribution and similar amplitudes). This confirms the high-match decision.\\n- The two dissimilar references labeled 1 demonstrate either markedly different mid/late-stage structure (e.g., larger late spikes, different timing or stronger intermediate-frequency content) or more distributed energy patterns. Our sample lacks those distinguishing label_1 late-stage signatures (large late spike and immediate rebound) that some label_1 references show, further supporting label_0.\\n- Important caution: the task information explicitly flagged this sample as a boundary case that the black-box often misclassifies (black-box tends to predict label 1). The reason the black-box errs is likely because isolated low-frequency SHAP signals in the mid-trough can be weighted as atypical for one class and push the model toward the other.

Therefore similarity to label_0 is high.\\n- Match to label_1 (normal heartbeat) feature list: Label_1 also lists sequences that superficially resemble this tri-phasic morphology (early small positive transient, deep negative valley, recovery and optional late spike). Indeed there is partial overlap: the presence of a pronounced low-frequency valley and recovery is a shared pattern. However, key differences reduce the match: (a) the early positive transient in this sample is very prominent and high-amplitude, matching label_0 examples better; (b) the mid trough and its DC-dominant signature in this sample (and the way STFT energy is concentrated) is more consistent with the label_0 examples that are known boundary cases; (c) label_1 examples that are strongly typical often show different late-stage signatures (sometimes larger late spikes or different intermediate-frequency content). Also the provided misclassification analysis indicates that samples with the exact combination present here (notably a DC/0Hz-dominant mid trough that the black-box flags atypical) are true label_0 recordings that the model sometimes incorrectly predicts as label_1. So while there is moderate superficial similarity to label_1, the deeper pattern and the reference examples favor label_0.\\n\\nSimilarity quantification (per instruction Step 3):\\n- Similarity to label_0: 4 (High similarity). Rationale: \u226580% of label_0's main features are present (early sharp positive transient, DC-dominant broad trough, smooth recovery); timing, amplitude ranges and STFT low-frequency energy closely match the label_0 references.  \\n- Similarity to label_1: 2 (Low similarity). Rationale: There are some overlapping components (valley + recovery), but the prominence of the early spike, the exact DC-dominant mid-trough morphology, and the match to multiple label_0 reference samples reduce conformity to the canonical label_1 fingerprint to below 50%.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and possible black-box misclassification behavior:\\n- I compared the sample against the four similar reference samples labeled 0. Those references show the same tri-phasic form: strong early spike, broad low-frequency trough centered near t\u224830\u201345, and a smooth recovery to a later positive plateau. The STFT patterns are also congruent: concentrated energy in the 0 Hz / very-low-frequency rows in the same time blocks. This strong visual and time-frequency similarity increases confidence that the sample's true category is label_0.  \\n- The two provided dissimilar reference samples labeled 1 show different late-stage/high-frequency behavior (e.g., larger late spikes, more intermediate-frequency energy) and different amplitude/timing relationships; the sample to classify is visually and spectrally less consistent with those label_1 examples.  \\n- The earlier analysis from other assistants and the dataset note about typical misclassification are consistent with this being a known boundary pattern: the model sometimes up-weights a localized negative SHAP (0 Hz) contribution during the trough and thereby tips the prediction toward label_1. However, careful inspection of morphology and the STFT low-frequency blocks shows this is one of the canonical true-label-0 patterns that the black-box tends to mislabel. That historical misclassification tendency is useful to explain why an automated model might predict label_1, but it should not override the morphological and spectral evidence pointing to label_0.\\n\\nFinal decision and summary:\\n- Chosen label: label 0 (myocardial infarction event).  \\n- Confidence / score: 4 (high).  \\n- Final justification: The sample exhibits the full tri-phasic label_0 signature \u2014 a very large early positive transient, a broad smooth DC-dominant mid trough (largest negative excursion), and a smooth recovery to a late positive plateau. STFT energy is concentrated in the very-low-frequency rows for all main events, matching label_0 references and the label_0 feature list. Although parts of the pattern (valley + recovery) superficially resemble label_1, the overall morphology, amplitudes and spectral concentration align far better with label_0. The known black-box misclassification pattern (which tends to flip such true label_0 examples to label_1) explains why an automated model might predict label_1, but it does not change the correct assignment based on the features present.\"\n    ]\n}"

In this sample the trough is strongly DC-dominant, so the same localized 0Hz signal is present and could be weighted oddly by a black-box.  \\n- Which observed features match that description: the trough\u2019s concentrated 0Hz energy (clear in the STFT) is exactly the component that other analyses flagged as producing a negative SHAP effect in boundary examples. Because this is a known model weak point, that trough\u2019s 0Hz signature is a likely source of misclassification risk.  \\n- Non-boundary-supporting features: the early very large positive transient and the absence of a pronounced late high-amplitude spike (which is more typical in some label_1 references) reduce ambiguity in favor of label_0.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match sample features to label summaries (avoid treating misclassification features as sole basis):\\n- Match to label_0 (myocardial infarction):\\n  - Label_0 canonical features: early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20138), early-to-mid broad deep negative valley (t\u22488\u201330/35\u201345) dominated by low-frequency energy, mid recovery/positive hump, and sometimes a late plateau.  \\n  - The sample contains all these elements with matching timing, amplitude, morphology (sharp early spike; wide, smooth mid trough; smooth recovery to plateau) and STFT low-frequency concentration. This is a strong match.\\n- Match to label_1 (normal heartbeat):\\n  - Label_1 also lists a valley\u2192recovery sequence and low-frequency dominance as a typical fingerprint, so there is superficial overlap. However, many label_1 reference examples either have different early transient amplitude (usually smaller) or show more distinctive late-stage spikes/rebounds or stronger intermediate-frequency content. The current sample\u2019s very large early transient and the particular shape/timing of the broad DC-dominant trough align more closely to label_0 examples described in the summaries.  \\n- Important caveat: The mid-trough\u2019s concentrated 0Hz energy is the same component that historically can be mis-weighted by the black-box (leading it to predict label_1 for some true label_0 cases). Because of that known failure mode, we do not treat a single localized atypical model signal (e.g., a negative SHAP cell) as decisive; instead we weigh the full morphological + spectral pattern.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Consideration of black-box output and other assistants\u2019 analyses; final classification decision:\\n- Black-box prediction and certainty: The provided black-box output lists Predicted: 0 (logits [0.6757, -2.1849]).

Their reasoning aligns with the detailed feature matches to label_0 and with the identification of the mid-trough 0Hz component as the key boundary signal that can trick automated models.  \\n- Final decision rationale: Aggregating evidence \u2014 (1) the strong match of the full tri-phasic pattern to label_0 canonical features (early large sharp positive transient + broad DC-dominant mid trough + smooth recovery to late plateau), (2) STFT confirmation that the main events are low-frequency morphological features (not high-frequency noise), (3) the early transient amplitude being more consistent with label_0 examples than label_1 examples, and (4) concordance with multiple human analyses \u2014 I conclude the correct classification is label 0.

The rise is steep and the early peak is narrow. The signal crosses the zero line shortly after this early spike (around t\u22488).\\n  - Early-to-mid stage (t \u2248 9\u201334): A broad, deep negative valley/trough that reaches about \u22122.0 to \u22122.3 (deepest around t\u224826\u201330). The trough is wide (many time steps), fairly smooth (low volatility) and is the largest negative excursion in the trace.\\n  - Mid recovery (t \u2248 34\u201355): Smooth recovery from the trough, crossing y=0 around t\u224842\u201344 and producing a sustained positive hump/plateau up to roughly +0.6\u2013+1.0. The recovery is relatively steady with small, low-amplitude oscillations but no strong jitter.\\n  - Late stage (t \u2248 55\u201395): A sustained, low-to-moderate positive plateau with mild fluctuations (amplitude ~+0.3\u2013+0.9). No very large late spike (>+3) is present; fluctuations are moderate and mostly slow.\\n- Time-frequency (STFT) observations:\\n  - The highest energy is concentrated in the lowest-frequency row(s) during the early spike and, especially, the deep trough window (~t\u224812\u201334). That block shows very strong low-frequency energy (bright/yellow in the lowest-frequency rows), indicating slow, large-amplitude deviations dominate.\\n  - There is little spread of energy into intermediate and high-frequency rows. Intermediate-frequency content is minimal (no broad vertical high-frequency bands), which indicates the waveform transitions are mostly low-frequency (smooth) rather than jittery.\\n  - Overall the time-frequency signature is dominated by 0\u2013low-frequency energy during the major deviations (early spike and trough), and the mid-to-late positive plateau also carries low-frequency energy but weaker.\\n- Volatility/other: The major deviations (early spike and trough) are smooth (low high-frequency jitter); transitions and recovery are gradual with low volatility.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 feature pattern of the sample (phase-wise summary):\\n- Phase A (early): A distinct, sharp early positive transient (large amplitude, steep rise & fall) at t\u22480\u20138.\\n- Phase B (early-to-mid): A broad, deep negative trough from t\u22489\u201334 (largest negative amplitude, smooth and prolonged).\\n- Phase C (mid): Steady low-volatility recovery from trough to a sustained positive hump/plateau crossing zero around t\u224842\u201344 and reaching a moderate positive level by t\u224850.\\n- Phase D (late): Sustained low-to-moderate positive plateau with mild slow fluctuations (no abrupt late large spike). Time-frequency footprint: concentrated low-frequency energy during Phases A and B and mainly low-frequency energy throughout recovery and plateau; negligible intermediate/high-frequency spread (i.e., little jitter).\\nThis combination is: early sharp positive spike + prolonged deep low-frequency trough + smooth recovery to sustained positive plateau + low high-frequency content.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 compare sample pattern against provided label feature lists and score similarities (1\u20134):\\n- Match to label_0 (myocardial infarction event):\\n  - Matching features: prominent early sharp positive transient (t\u22648) with high amplitude; an early-to-mid broad, deep negative valley (\u22121.0 to \u22122.6) occupying many time steps; smooth mid recovery to a sustained positive hump; dominant low-frequency energy concentrated on the trough and early spike; little intermediate-frequency jitter. These are the core, typical attributes described for label_0 and match this sample strongly.\\n  - Confounding features: label_0 sometimes includes a late secondary positive peak in some samples; the test sample does not have a large late spike \u2014 but that is an optional label_0 feature, not required.\\n  - Similarity score assigned: 4 (High similarity). Rationale: The majority (>80%) of the hallmark label_0 features (early sharp spike, long deep trough at low frequency, smooth recovery/plateau, low jitter) are present and align closely in timing and magnitude.\\n- Match to label_1 (normal heartbeat):\\n  - Matching features: label_1 description also lists early small positive transient + deep negative valley + recovery + late plateau/spike as its canonical sequence; many of these high-level morphological elements overlap with this sample. The STFT low-frequency concentration during the trough is also common to label_1 samples.\\n  - Differences: label_1 examples often show more ambiguous intermediate-frequency contributions in transitions or sometimes a pronounced late spike (>+3) used as supportive evidence for label_1 in some samples. The test sample shows minimal intermediate-frequency spread (little jitter) and lacks a pronounced late spike \u2014 characteristics more consistently emphasized as typical for label_0 in the provided descriptions. Additionally, the very prominent, sharp early positive transient followed by an almost immediate descent into a broad trough is described as particularly typical of label_0 in the feature summary.\\n  - Similarity score assigned: 3 (Moderate similarity). Rationale: Many gross morphological elements match (valley + recovery), so there is substantial overlap, but specific nuances (the very sharp early spike, dominant low-frequency trough without intermediate-frequency jitter, and no late big spike) make label_1 a somewhat weaker fit than label_0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 cross-check with reference samples and verification of scoring and final decision:\\n- Reference-sample comparison:\\n  - The test sample is visually and morphologically similar to both label_1 reference samples (Sample 11 and Sample 40) and label_0 reference samples (Sample 84 and Sample 14) \u2014 this confirms it is a boundary-like example where both classes share the canonical valley\u2192recovery motif.\\n  - Comparing details: the test sample\u2019s early positive spike is as sharp and large as seen in the label_0 references (Samples 84 and 14) and its trough depth and low-frequency concentration are also consistent with those label_0 references. The label_1 references that look similar (Samples 11 and 40) also have large early spikes, but in the label descriptions the classifier sometimes treats intermediate-frequency spread or late spikes differently for label_1; our sample lacks those intermediate-frequency ambiguous signatures and instead shows concentrated low-frequency energy \u2014 a point favoring label_0.\\n  - Dissimilar references (Samples 47 and 27) highlight that some label_0 examples can have strong late spikes or more intermediate-frequency energy; our sample does not follow those dissimilar patterns, which supports the earlier scoring logic that label_0 is the best match among the two labels.\\n- Fairness and consistency check:\\n  - The scoring (label_0:4, label_1:3) reflects that while the two label descriptions share a common canonical morphology, the test sample matches the specific emphasis and typicalities given for label_0 (notably the pronounced early spike followed by a deep, low-frequency trough and smooth low-jitter recovery). The STFT low-frequency dominance during the trough is a critical piece of evidence that was weighted heavily because the feature summaries mark low-frequency red in the trough as a primary typical signature for label_0.\\n  - The assignment avoids being misled by the black-box model\u2019s supposed tendency to call such traces label_1: the decision is driven by cross-checked morphological and time-frequency evidence and explicit reference comparisons rather than the black-box label.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification summary:\\n- Final classification: label 0 (myocardial infarction event).\\n- Primary reasons: the sample exhibits the label_0-typical combination of (1) a very sharp, high-amplitude early positive transient, (2) a broad, deep negative trough concentrated in low-frequency energy, and (3) a smooth, low-volatility recovery to a sustained positive plateau. The STFT shows strong energy strictly in the lowest-frequency rows during the major deviations and minimal intermediate/high-frequency spread, matching label_0\u2019s typical low-frequency fingerprint. Although label_1 shares the general valley\u2192recovery morphology (hence a moderate similarity), the specific timing, amplitude, and clean low-frequency signature align more strongly with label_0, justifying a high-similarity score (4) for label_0 and the final choice.\"\n    ]\n}"

The mere presence of that sequence is therefore ambiguous and is the primary source of black-box confusion.\\n- Specific ambiguous features in the sample that could mislead a model that focuses on coarse morphology: (1) a pronounced deep trough concentrated in low frequencies (a signature emphasized as typical for both labels in many examples), and (2) the smooth recovery to a positive plateau (again common to both labels). If a classifier relies only on the coarse valley\u2192recovery shape and not on subtle distinctions (e.g., timing/relative sharpness of the early spike, precise trough amplitude and time-frequency concentration), it can misclassify.\\n- Features that reduce misclassification risk (favor label_0): the very sharp early positive transient combined with a broad deep trough and especially the STFT concentration strictly at the lowest-frequency rows (minimal intermediate-frequency content). According to the provided label summaries, this combination is more strongly described as typical for label_0 than for label_1 (label_1 examples more often show intermediate-frequency spread or large late spikes in some cases).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match sample features to label summaries while avoiding misleading features as sole evidence:\\n- Match to label_0 (myocardial infarction event): strong alignment. Label_0 typical list explicitly cites: (a) early sharp positive transient (t\u22728) with low-frequency energy, (b) broad deep negative valley in early-to-mid phase with dominant low-frequency energy, (c) smooth mid recovery/positive hump dominated by low-frequency components. Our sample matches all three strongly (timing, amplitude ranges, and STFT low-frequency concentration). The absence of optional late sharp spikes does not contradict label_0 because such late spikes are listed as present only in some label_0 samples.\\n- Match to label_1 (normal heartbeat): partial alignment. Label_1 also contains the valley\u2192recovery morphological sequence and low-frequency trough energy in many references. That makes this a boundary case. However, label_1 reference features often include (in some samples) more intermediate-frequency spread during transitions or late large spikes, which our sample lacks. Given the sample\u2019s minimal intermediate/high-frequency content and no very-large late spike, its detailed time-frequency signature aligns better with the label_0 typical descriptions rather than label_1's variable examples.\\n- Decision rule applied: do not let the gross valley\u2192recovery sequence (a shared, confounding feature) be the decisive factor. Instead give weight to the joint occurrence of (i) a sharp early positive transient, (ii) a broad, deep trough of similar amplitude range to label_0 examples, and (iii) concentrated very-low-frequency energy with little intermediate-frequency spread \u2014 together these favor label_0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Compare with other assistants and black-box model, and provide final classification + alternatives:\\n- Other assistants (Rounds 1\u20133) all concluded label_0 with high-confidence score (4/4) using similar reasoning: emphasis on the early sharp transient + deep low-frequency trough + smooth recovery and STFT low-frequency concentration as discriminative for label_0.\\n- Black-box model predicted label_0 as well (logits reported: [0.1665, -1.4734] and final predicted label 0). This agrees with the careful feature-level analysis; the model\u2019s numeric logits show separation in favor of label_0 (higher logit for label_0 class index), consistent with the visual/time-frequency evidence.\\n- Final classification: label_0 (myocardial infarction event). Rationale: The sample\u2019s combined set of discriminative features \u2014 especially the very sharp early positive transient in tandem with a deep, wide negative trough and STFT energy tightly concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows with minimal intermediate-frequency spread \u2014 matches the label_0 typical fingerprint in the provided summaries more strongly than label_1. The absence of label_1-supporting optional features (notably a very-large late spike or broader intermediate-frequency jitter) reduces the plausibility of label_1.\\n- Alternative (lower-confidence) classification: label_1. Reason: because the two classes share the valley\u2192recovery morphology, a classifier focusing only on that coarse shape (ignoring the early-spike sharpness and strict low-frequency concentration) could plausibly predict label_1. However, given the detailed STFT and amplitude evidence, this is the less supported choice.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Verification and final sanity-check of reasoning:\\n- Confirmed that the strongest discriminators (sharpness/timing of early spike, trough amplitude, and strict low-frequency concentration) were used rather than the shared valley\u2192recovery morphology alone.\\n- Cross-checked against reference descriptions and the other assistants\u2019 analyses; all converge on label_0 for the same reasons, and the black-box model prediction also agrees. No relevant discriminative feature was ignored (the optional label_0 late spike is absent but optional, not required). The classification does not rely on features known to be atypical or ambiguous for label_0.\\n\\nConclusion: Final label = label 0 (myocardial infarction event). The black-box model result = label 0. Alternative plausible label (lower confidence) = label 1 due to shared coarse morphology, but detailed time-frequency and amplitude evidence favors label_0.\"\n  ]\n}"

This is consistent with the detailed visual and STFT evidence supporting label_0. The black-box\u2019s numerical prediction reinforces, rather than contradicts, the assembled evidence in this instance. Note: the task background warns that models can be biased toward labeling such valley\u2192recovery morphologies as label_1 in some cases; here the black-box\u2019s outcome fortunately matches the more careful morphological interpretation.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 5 \u2014 Final classification decision, alternatives, and verification of reasoning:\",\n    \" - Final decision: label 0 (myocardial infarction event). Reasoning summary: the sample shows a distinct early sharp positive transient, a broad and smooth deep negative trough with dominant very-low-frequency energy, and a smooth recovery hump \u2014 a combination that the label_0 summary specifically lists as typical. The STFT confirms energy concentration in the lowest-frequency rows during the trough and recovery, and intermediate-frequency spread (a hallmark of atypical jitter and sometimes associated with label_1 variants) is minimal. The absence of a large late spike and the presence of the pronounced early transient together tip the balance strongly toward label_0.\",\n    \" - Alternative (less likely) label: label 1. Rationale for alternative: because label_1 shares the canonical valley\u2192recovery morphology and also treats concentrated low-frequency trough energy as typical, a classifier relying primarily on that single cue (without weighing the early spike sharpness) could place this sample in label_1. However, other discriminative cues (sharp early spike, minimal intermediate-frequency jitter, no large late spike) argue against label_1 for this sample.\",\n    \"\",\n    \" - Verification / sanity check: Cross-referencing the extracted numeric amplitudes, STFT localization, and the set of reference examples provided (including the label_0 reference that closely matches this trace) confirms consistency. The three assistant analyses and the black-box model output converge on label_0 in this case, and the described discriminators provide a defensible reason to choose label_0 rather than being misled by the shared valley\u2192recovery pattern.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Final statement: Based on the stepwise feature extraction, STFT analysis, careful avoidance of over-weighting the ambiguous valley\u2192recovery cue, comparison to label prototypes and reference samples, and cross-checking against other analyses and the model output, the most reasonable and supported classification for Sample 86 is label 0.\"\n  ]\n}"

Also the absence of label_1-specific hallmark variations (e.g., a very large late positive spike with intermediate-frequency energy and a sharp post-spike rebound as a key label_1 signature in some reference cases) reduces the conformity to label_1 compared to label_0.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check vs. reference samples and consideration of model misclassification issues:\",\n    \"  - Visual comparison to the four 'similar' reference samples (all labeled 0) shows near-identical morphology (early positive peak near +2, broad mid trough to about \u22122 around the same relative time, then smooth recovery to a positive plateau).

STFT: continued low-frequency energy in this time window (moderate at 0Hz row) and only weak, localized energy in intermediate frequencies (i.e., no broad-band high-frequency footprint).\\n- Frequency-distribution summary: signal energy for the major events (early spike, mid trough, late plateau) is dominated by the lowest-frequency bin (0Hz) and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows; the intermediate and high-frequency rows remain low except for small localized patches during short transitions.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Which sample features are ambiguous / likely to cause misclassification (boundary properties):\\n- Shared coarse morphology: both label_0 and label_1 canonical descriptions include the sequence early positive bump \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery to a positive plateau. Because of this, the sample sits near the decision boundary: many of its macro-features are not uniquely discriminative.\\n- The mid trough\u2019s very-strong DC / 0Hz concentration is a key ambiguous element. The heatmap/SHAP in prior analyses flagged the 0Hz mid trough cell as strongly influential and sometimes atypical for one class in previous examples; such concentrated DC energy at the trough is a known source of black-box confusion (models or SHAP may overweight or misinterpret a single dominant low-frequency cell). That makes the sample a boundary case because the same 0Hz-dominant trough can be typical for both labels in different samples.\\n- Lack of a very-large late spike: label_1 examples often (but not always) have large late spikes with intermediate-frequency content; the absence of such a pronounced late spike in this sample reduces support for the label_1-specific late-spike pattern. Conversely, the sample's smooth low-frequency trough + plateau pattern is strongly consistent with many label_0 references.\\n- Intermediate-frequency jitter is minimal here. If substantial jitter were present, the model might be pushed toward one label or produce more ambiguity; its absence reduces one axis of confusion but does not eliminate the DC-dominance ambiguity.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching this sample\u2019s features to the provided label summaries (preliminary judgment while avoiding reliance on misclassification-prone cues):\\n- Label_0 signature: early sharp positive transient, early-to-mid broad deep negative valley dominated by low-frequency energy, mid recovery/positive hump, possible late plateau. Our sample matches these strongly: timing, amplitude ranges (early peak ~+1.7\u20132.0, trough to ~\u22122.0 at t~34, recovery to ~+1.0\u20131.3), and STFT low-frequency dominance all align with label_0 canonical examples.\\n- Label_1 signature: also lists the same triple-phase structure (early bump \u2192 deep valley \u2192 recovery), with some examples showing large late spikes and occasional intermediate-frequency spread. Our sample shares the coarse valley\u2192recovery shape (so it has nontrivial similarity to label_1), but it lacks the strong late spike / intermediate-frequency footprint that in many label_1 cases is supportive evidence for label_1.\\n- Guiding principle: because the mid trough\u2019s DC dominance is a known misclassification trigger (the model/SHAP sometimes overweights a single 0Hz cell), I do not treat single-cell SHAP/0Hz anomalies as sole decisive evidence. Instead I use the full morphological + STFT pattern and reference-sample similarity. By that comparison, the sample\u2019s features more closely match the label_0 references in timing, amplitude, and frequency footprint (especially the smooth, DC-dominant trough and the moderate late plateau rather than a large late spike).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Compare to the black-box and other assistants, and produce final decision and alternatives:\\n- Black-box output: predicted label 0 (logits provided: [0.3040132224559784, -1.745934009552002]). That aligns with the pattern matching and the majority of human-analyst assessments.\\n- Three other assistants: all three concluded label 0 with high similarity scores and similar rationales (they emphasized match to label_0 reference morphology and DC-energy distribution). Their analyses also flagged the sample as a boundary case but concluded that the overall evidence supports label 0.\\n- Final judgement: label 0 (myocardial infarction event). Rationale distilled: (1) the precise timing and amplitude of the early peak, broad smooth trough (to \u2248\u22122.0 around t\u224834) and recovery to a sustained plateau match the label_0 canonical patterns and labeled-0 reference samples; (2) STFT shows concentrated 0Hz/very-low-frequency energy for the trough and recovery (consistent with label_0 patterns in the provided summary); (3) the sample lacks label_1-favoring discriminators such as a very large late spike with substantial intermediate-frequency content; (4) ambiguous/misleading single-cell 0Hz SHAP signals are explicitly not used as primary evidence \u2014 they are recognized as a common source of black-box misclassification but should not override the full morphological+frequency match to label_0 references.\\n- Alternative (less likely) classification: label 1. Reason: the coarse valley\u2192recovery morphology is indeed shared with many label_1 examples and therefore label_1 cannot be ruled out entirely; if the model placed excessive weight on some low-frequency cells or if additional unseen context favored label_1, a different decision could occur. However, given the full evidence here, label 1 is the weaker hypothesis.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Verification of reasoning and final statement:\\n- I verified that I did not rely solely on the mid trough\u2019s single 0Hz SHAP/blue signal (a known misclassification feature) and instead relied on aggregate morphological and time-frequency evidence and reference-pattern matching.\\n- Conclusion: after careful stepwise analysis, the most reasonable and supported classification is label 0. The black-box and three assistant analyses agree with this. The key discriminative evidence is the smooth, DC-dominant mid trough and the absence of a label_1-typical very-large late spike or strong intermediate-frequency spread.\\n\\nFinal output: result = [\\\"label 0\\\"].\"\n  ]\n}"

No very large late spike (>~2.0) is present.\\n- Morphology details & volatility: The early positive transient is steep and smooth (low high-frequency jitter). The negative trough is broad and smooth (low volatility) rather than a sharp spike, and the recovery rise is relatively smooth (some small transition variability but no strong oscillatory jitter).\\n- Amplitude ranges: Early peak \u2248 +2.4\u2013+2.7; trough bottom \u2248 -1.6 to -1.8; recovery plateau \u2248 +0.1\u2013+0.6.\\n- Time-frequency (STFT) observations: High energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency row(s) during the early window and the trough window (strong low-frequency band energy between ~t\u22480\u20138 and ~t\u224812\u201344). The mid/late recovery window also shows predominant energy in the lowest-frequency rows. There is little spread into intermediate/high frequency bands \u2014 only faint/limited intermediate-frequency energy during transitions. Overall frequency footprint is dominated by very-low-frequency energy, indicating smooth, slow components rather than strong jitter.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 summary of the sample's feature pattern (composed features and sequence):\\n- The sample is composed of the canonical sequence: early steep positive transient -> broad deep negative trough -> smooth recovery to a sustained low-amplitude positive plateau. Phases: Early (0\u20138): sharp, large-amplitude positive spike; Early\u2013mid (8\u201344): broad deep negative valley (dominant negative excursion); Mid\u2013late (44\u201360): relatively rapid but smooth recovery crossing baseline; Late (60\u201395): sustained mild positive plateau with low jitter.\\n- Frequency signature reinforcing the morphology: All major deviations (early spike and the trough + recovery) are captured primarily in the 0 Hz / very-low-frequency STFT rows (strong low-frequency energy). Intermediate-frequency spread is minor, indicating low jitter and smooth transitions.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 match to label feature lists and initial similarity scoring reasoning:\\n- Label 0 (myocardial infarction event) canonical features (from the provided label summaries): early sharp positive transient (t\u22648) often large, broad deep negative valley (t\u22488\u201330), smooth mid recovery positive hump (t\u224830\u201360), and sometimes a late plateau/secondary peak. Typical heatmap signature is concentrated energy in the lowest-frequency rows for the early spike, trough and recovery; intermediate-frequency jitter is often absent or considered atypical for the label. \\n  - Match assessment: Sample 97 matches these label 0 features very strongly: early sharp/large positive transient, broad smooth negative trough, smooth recovery to a low-amplitude plateau, and concentrated energy in the very-low-frequency bands. Little intermediate-frequency jitter (also expected for label 0 typical cases). This is a high degree of match.\\n- Label 1 (normal heartbeat) canonical features (from the provided label summaries): also often shows an early small positive transient, a pronounced deep valley (t\u224812\u201336), and a recovery to a positive plateau; the label also sometimes shows a large late spike and model typically relies on the low-frequency valley+recovery signature. However label 1 descriptions note that intermediate-frequency spread/jitter and some isolated 0Hz anomalies may be ambiguous or atypical.\\n  - Match assessment: Sample 97 does overlap with label 1 in the broad valley + recovery sequence, so there is non-trivial similarity. But the early positive transient in Sample 97 is larger/steeper than the typical \u201csmall\u201d early transient described for label 1, and the overall frequency footprint (very concentrated in the lowest frequencies, low intermediate-band energy) aligns more with the label_0 descriptions where an early sharp spike is a common typical feature.\\n- Numerical similarity judgements used to choose the final label (explained here though final output score reports the chosen-label score):\\n  - Label 0 similarity: high (4/4). Rationale: >=80% of label-0 hallmark features are present (large/steep early positive transient, broad low-frequency negative trough, smooth mid recovery, low intermediate-frequency jitter, matching STFT low-frequency concentration). Also visually very close to multiple label-0 reference samples (Samples 14, 85, 6) in both line-shape and STFT.\\n  - Label 1 similarity: moderate (3/4). Rationale: The broad-tough + recovery morphology is a principal shared pattern and STFT low-frequency energy during trough is also a hallmark of label 1. However, the comparatively larger early spike and the lack of prominent late high-amplitude spike (which is often present in some label-1 examples) make label 1 a slightly weaker match than label 0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 cross-check against provided reference samples and guard against black-box misclassification bias:\\n- Comparison to similar reference label-0 samples (Samples 14, 85, 6): Visual and STFT similarity is strong \u2014 these references show the same sequence (early steep positive spike, large broad trough, smooth recovery to a mid/late plateau) and dominant low-frequency STFT energy. The magnitudes and timings align closely with Sample 97.\\n- Comparison to the similar label-1 reference (Sample 40) and other label-1s: They also share the valley+recovery pattern; Sample 40 in particular looks similar in the middle portion. However many label-1 references that the black-box learned to favor also include distinctive late spikes or other mid/late features (or slightly different early transient magnitude) that differ from Sample 97. Importantly, the provided analysis warned that the black-box tends to misclassify this boundary type as label 1 because the valley+recovery is a strong label-1 cue. I accounted for this bias and focused on features that are more discriminative: the amplitude and sharpness of the early positive transient and the consistency of dominant low-frequency energy across the early/trough/recovery windows \u2014 both favor label 0 here.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification:\\n- Result: label 0. Score: 4 (high similarity / high confidence for label 0).\\n- Why: Sample 97 contains the canonical label-0 fingerprint: a pronounced early, steep positive transient (large amplitude ~+2.4\u20132.7), followed by a broad low-volatility negative trough (\u2248-1.6 to -1.8) and a smooth recovery into a sustained low-amplitude positive plateau. The STFT shows energy concentrated in the 0Hz / lowest-frequency rows for the spike, trough and recovery windows, matching the label-0 typical time-frequency signature.

Label_0 descriptions note that intermediate-frequency spread during abrupt spikes can appear atypical; sample 15 lacks a strongly abrupt late spike and shows only minimal intermediate-frequency ambiguity.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Given these specifics, sample 15 aligns slightly more closely with the label_1 canonical pattern (deep low-frequency valley at t\u224812\u201336 strongly typical, smooth recovery and a moderate late hump), even though the overall morphological shapes are shared between labels.

Only small intermediate-frequency energy shows up briefly around transition windows, indicating minimal jitter.\",\n    \"3) SHAP heatmap (model contribution / typicality by time-frequency):\",\n    \"- The trough time-region at the lowest-frequency rows shows a prominent red block (strong positive SHAP) \u2192 the model treats the low-frequency components of the broad trough as a strongly typical feature.\",\n    \"- Early positive transient: light-to-moderate red in low-frequency rows \u2192 treated as a typical (supportive) feature.\",\n    \"- Recovery region: mostly light-red/neutral in low-frequency rows but with one localized blue cell at the absolute lowest-frequency during the immediate recovery window \u2192 overall the recovery is treated as typical, with a small ambiguous/atypical micro-component at one very-low-frequency cell.\",\n    \"- Mid-to-late plateau and late modest hump: generally light-red in low-frequency rows (supportive/typical), with sparse light-blue cells at some intermediate frequencies (minor atypical jitter).\",\n    \"4) Mapping features to typical/atypical/ambiguous per heatmap:\",\n    \"- Deep negative valley (dominant event): typical \u2014 strong red at 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows (clear decisive typical signature).\",\n    \"- Early positive transient: typical \u2014 low-frequency red but weaker than the trough.\",\n    \"- Recovery crossing baseline: overall typical/supporting (low-frequency red/neutral) but contains a single, small ambiguous/atypical low-freq cell (minor).\",\n    \"- Late plateau & modest late peak: typical/weakly typical \u2014 low-frequency light-red; minor intermediate-frequency blue patches indicate limited atypical jitter but are not dominant.\",\n    \"- High/intermediate-frequency content: sparse and not dominant; where present it's lightly blue (treated as mildly atypical by the model).\",\n    \"Step 1 conclusion: The sample's dominant discriminative signature is the broad deep trough localized in time and concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows \u2014 this region is strongly red and therefore a prototypical model-supported feature. Other events (early transient, recovery, plateau) are also marked mostly red/neutral, with only very small localized blue areas (minor ambiguities).\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Evaluate black-box model logits and confidence combined with heatmap:\",\n    \"- Provided logits: [label0: -2.317066192626953, label1: 3.1169095039367676]. Converting to softmax probabilities yields approximately: P(label1) \u2248 exp(3.1169)/(exp(3.1169)+exp(-2.3171)) \u2248 0.995 (\u224899.5%), P(label0) \u2248 0.005 (\u22480.5%). The model's numeric confidence in label 1 is therefore very high.\",\n    \"- Heatmap confirms that the model's decisive evidence (strong red) aligns with a canonical low-frequency deep trough event in the sample \u2014 the very region the model relies on. Red-dominant low-frequency blocks coincide with the largest-magnitude, smooth trough in the waveform.\",\n    \"- There are only small, isolated blue pockets: one very localized blue cell at the absolute lowest-frequency during the immediate recovery and sparse light-blue intermediate-frequency cells late. According to the provided rules, these small blue markings do not overturn the red-dominant trough block and are minor ambiguities rather than strong contradictory evidence.\",\n    \"- Therefore the black-box model's high logit/probability for label 1 is consistent with the heatmap main signal. The model is not contradicting itself: its strongest SHAP marks are typical features for label 1.\",\n    \"Step 2 conclusion: The model's classification (label 1) is credible and well-supported by the heatmap; this is not a borderline case. The sample should be considered a typical example (for the model) of label 1 rather than a confusing/boundary sample.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Compare to label feature summaries and external assistant analyses:\",\n    \"- From the provided label summaries: both label_0 and label_1 can share the coarse morphological sequence (early small positive bump \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 plateau/late peak). The key discriminator in the provided documentation is which time-frequency components the model treats as typical. Label_1 documentation specifically emphasizes a strongly red low-frequency block in the trough window (t\u224812\u201336) as the canonical fingerprint for label 1.\",\n    \"- The sample's heatmap exactly displays that canonical strong low-frequency red block in the trough window, matching the label_1 description closely.\",\n    \"- The three independent assistants all concluded label 1 with high similarity/confidence and gave essentially the same reasoning: the prominent low-frequency deep trough and supporting recovery/plateau red signals point to label 1. Their assessments align with the heatmap and the black-box model's prediction.\",\n    \"Step 3 conclusion: Both expert summaries and independent assistants consistently support label 1; the SHAP evidence matches label_1 canonical descriptions more than any label_0 specifics that would conflict.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Final verification and decision-making:\",\n    \"- Re-check for overlooked pattern features: there is no large intermediate/high-frequency spread (which could indicate atypical jitter or a sign pointing away from label 1), there is no dominant blue block anywhere that would indicate the model views core events as atypical for the predicted label. Only minor, isolated blue pixels exist and are insufficient to negate the large red trough block.\",\n    \"- Cross-check internal consistency: strong model logits \u2192 heatmap red dominance on the trough \u2192 waveform shows a clean wide trough that produced that energy. Everything is consistent and mutually reinforcing.\",\n    \"Final decision: The most reasonable and supported classification is label 1 (normal heartbeat). The black-box model's predicted label 1 is credible and well-justified by both the logits (very high probability) and the SHAP heatmap (dominant red in the trough low-frequency region). The three assistants' independent verdicts agree and the sample is not a boundary/ambiguous case in this analysis.\",\n    \"Final concise conclusion: result = label 1 (matches black-box model).\"\n  ]\n}"

STFT: very strong energy concentrated in the 0 Hz (DC) row in the ~15\u201334 window (bright yellow). SHAP: the 0 Hz row in this mid window is strongly red (large positive SHAP), and several immediately adjacent low-frequency rows show light red as well \u2014 so the model treats this deep mid trough as a typical feature for the class (red-dominant at 0Hz).\n- Mid-to-late recovery (t \u2248 34\u201355): a fast recovery / steep upward slope to a sustained positive plateau around +0.8\u2013+1.2 (with small jitters). STFT: DC/low-frequency energy present during the rise and plateau. SHAP: mostly light red in low-frequency bins in these time windows (typical/weakly supportive), some mixed faint values but no strong blue.\n- Late stage (t \u2248 55\u201395): slow decay toward baseline with low-amplitude oscillations near 0. STFT & SHAP: low energy and near-zero SHAP (neither strongly typical nor atypical). Very little blue overall; only a negligible blue patch at a high-frequency row in a late, low-energy column (insignificant).\n- Overall SHAP color judgment: the dominant mid-window low-frequency (0 Hz) energy is strongly red (typical). There is no dominant blue marking on the large mid trough; the map is overall supportive (red) of the class prediction in the highest-energy region.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern summary:\n- Pattern: early large positive transient + broad mid negative trough (deep DC-dominated) + steep recovery to a positive plateau + late decay to baseline. Heatmap/SHAP mapping: the critical mid trough (largest STFT energy) is labeled by SHAP as red (typical) rather than blue (atypical). Early transient and recovery windows are lightly red or neutral. Net effect: the strongest energy window (mid trough) contributes positively (typical) to the model\u2019s predicted class rather than acting as an atypical countervailing signal.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison to provided misclassification patterns and final judgment:\n- The sample\u2019s morphology (early large positive spike + deep mid trough + late positive plateau) superficially resembles the label_0 misclassification pattern descriptions (those examples often combine an early positive transient, a pronounced mid trough, and a late plateau). However, a key characteristic of the typical label_0 boundary cases in the provided summary is that the mid trough is SHAP-blue at the 0 Hz row (i.e., treated as atypical and driving misclassification). In this test sample the mid trough\u2019s 0 Hz components are strongly SHAP-red (typical) \u2014 the exact opposite SHAP signature that defined those boundary/misclassified examples.\n- Because the largest-energy event (mid trough) is marked typical (red) here, the model is unlikely to be confused by that feature in the same way as the documented misclassification cases. Therefore the sample does not closely match the described boundary/misclassification patterns. It has some morphological similarity (so I assign a low-to-moderate similarity score) but not the characteristic SHAP-atypical marking that causes the documented misclassification behavior.\n\nApproximate logits comment: for true boundary samples in the documentation the model\u2019s SHAP sums were dominated by early/critical blue regions producing a net negative contribution for the true class and flipping the logit sign. For this sample, because the mid trough (the dominant-energy window) is strongly red, the corresponding SHAP contribution would increase the logit for the predicted class; I would expect a non-boundary or only weakly-boundary logit margin (model confidence leaning toward its predicted class rather than a near-even tie).",

SHAP: the 0 Hz row in this mid window is strongly red (large positive SHAP), and several immediately adjacent low-frequency rows show light red as well \u2014 so the model treats this deep mid trough as a typical feature for the class (red-dominant at 0Hz).\\n- Mid-to-late recovery (t \u2248 34\u201355): a fast recovery / steep upward slope to a sustained positive plateau around +0.8\u2013+1.2 (with small jitters). STFT: DC/low-frequency energy present during the rise and plateau. SHAP: mostly light red in low-frequency bins in these time windows (typical/weakly supportive), some mixed faint values but no strong blue.\\n- Late stage (t \u2248 55\u201395): slow decay toward baseline with low-amplitude oscillations near 0. STFT & SHAP: low energy and near-zero SHAP (neither strongly typical nor atypical). Very little blue overall; only a negligible blue patch at a high-frequency row in a late, low-energy column (insignificant).\\n- Overall SHAP color judgment: the dominant mid-window low-frequency (0 Hz) energy is strongly red (typical). There is no dominant blue marking on the large mid trough; the map is overall supportive (red) of the class prediction in the highest-energy region.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern summary:\\n- Pattern: early large positive transient + broad mid negative trough (deep DC-dominated) + steep recovery to a positive plateau + late decay to baseline. Heatmap/SHAP mapping: the critical mid trough (largest STFT energy) is labeled by SHAP as red (typical) rather than blue (atypical). Early transient and recovery windows are lightly red or neutral. Net effect: the strongest energy window (mid trough) contributes positively (typical) to the model\u2019s predicted class rather than acting as an atypical countervailing signal.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison to provided misclassification patterns and final judgment:\\n- The sample\u2019s morphology (early large positive spike + deep mid trough + late positive plateau) superficially resembles the label_0 misclassification pattern descriptions (those examples often combine an early positive transient, a pronounced mid trough, and a late plateau). However, a key characteristic of the typical label_0 boundary cases in the provided summary is that the mid trough is SHAP-blue at the 0 Hz row (i.e., treated as atypical and driving misclassification). In this test sample the mid trough\u2019s 0 Hz components are strongly SHAP-red (typical) \u2014 the exact opposite SHAP signature that defined those boundary/misclassified examples.\\n- Because the largest-energy event (mid trough) is marked typical (red) here, the model is unlikely to be confused by that feature in the same way as the documented misclassification cases. Therefore the sample does not closely match the described boundary/misclassification patterns. It has some morphological similarity (so I assign a low-to-moderate similarity score) but not the characteristic SHAP-atypical marking that causes the documented misclassification behavior.\\n\\nApproximate logits comment: for true boundary samples in the documentation the model\u2019s SHAP sums were dominated by early/critical blue regions producing a net negative contribution for the true class and flipping the logit sign. For this sample, because the mid trough (the dominant-energy window) is strongly red, the corresponding SHAP contribution would increase the logit for the predicted class; I would expect a non-boundary or only weakly-boundary logit margin (model confidence leaning toward its predicted class rather than a near-even tie).\"\n    ]\n}",

The sample-to-be-classified matches these reference characteristics closely in time location, amplitude, and heatmap emphasis.\\n- Reference sample (Label 0) also contains similar morphological elements, but in label_0 reference examples the early positive transient and occasional late spikes are more prominent and intermediate-frequency contributions during transitions are sometimes ambiguous/atypical. Sample 23 does not show a large late spike and does not show pronounced intermediate-frequency ambiguity; instead the model's heatmap centers on the deep low-frequency trough, which is the most diagnostic feature for label_1 in the provided summaries.\\n\\nFinal decision and similarity scoring:\\n- Chosen label: label 1 (normal heartbeat). Rationale: the sample exhibits the canonical pattern emphasized for label_1 \u2014 a pronounced deep negative valley in the early-mid window (t\u224810\u201332) with very-strong red attribution at the 0 Hz / very-low-frequency rows, plus a low-frequency recovery hump \u2014 these are the primary, model-identified typical features for label_1 as described in the supplied feature list and match the label_1 reference.\\n- Similarity score for the chosen label: 4 (High similarity). Justification: the sample matches the main label_1 features (deep low-frequency trough + recovery) including the same time-region attribution that the model marks as strongly typical. The conformity in both waveform morphology and heatmap attribution is >80% with the label_1 pattern and the label_1 reference sample.\\n\\nAdditional comparative note (fairness check): the waveform morphology is similar to both labels at a superficial level, but the heatmap attributions (the decisive information linking time-frequency energy to class evidence) strongly favor label_1 because the deepest trough is heavily marked red at 0Hz in the canonical time window described for label_1.

In those documented boundary cases the mid deep trough is the core discriminative element that pushes the model towards predicting label 0.

There are no large blue (atypical) regions in these critical windows; intermediate-frequency rows are neutral rather than being marked blue, so there is little confusing or opposing evidence.\\n- Therefore the model\u2019s high numerical confidence is consistent with the SHAP attribution: the decisive features the model used (low-frequency trough + recovery) are present and marked typical.

That matches the sample exactly: very strong red at the low-frequency trough region and supporting red in recovery.\\n- Label_0 examples sometimes show intermediate-frequency spread or atypical blue patches during transitions or notable late sharp spikes; none of those atypical signatures are prominent here.\\n- All three independent assistants also concluded label 1 with high similarity scores and the same rationale (dominant low-frequency trough + red SHAP block). The black-box model also predicted label 1 with very high logit margin.

According to the provided label summaries, label 1 is characterized primarily by exactly this strong low-frequency deep-valley + recovery signature. The heatmap therefore supports the model's internal reasons for choosing label 1.\\n- Boundary vs typical sample: Because the most discriminative region (t\u224812\u201334 at 0Hz/low-frequency) is strongly red and intermediate-frequency ambiguity is absent, the sample behaves like a canonical example rather than a borderline/confusing one.

Label 0 examples sometimes include more intermediate-frequency spread or late-sharp spikes that can produce mixed heatmap patterns.\\n- Other assistants: Two of three external assistants (Round 2 and Round 3) independently classified the sample as label 1 with high similarity; one assistant (Round 1) favored label 0. Their rationales show that the waveform is ambiguous between labels by morphology alone but that the heatmap/STFT tilt the balance toward label 1 for two assistants. This aligns with the black-box model's decision.\\n- Reconciliation: The heatmap's concentrated red at the trough/recovery low-frequency rows matches label 1's canonical signature from the summaries and matches the majority of assistant judgments. The lack of intermediate-frequency blue/mixed regions removes a common reason to prefer label 0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final evaluation and decision check:\\n- The numerical confidence (large positive logit for label 1) and the heatmap's red-dominant, low-frequency emphasis on the trough/recovery strongly corroborate each other. There is no strong SHAP-based evidence of atypical features that would indicate confusion or a boundary case.\\n- Given the above, the black-box model's prediction (label 1) is credible and well-supported by both the time-frequency energy distribution and the SHAP explanations.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n- Final classification: label 1. This matches the black-box model's prediction and the majority of the assistant analyses. The decisive evidence is the strong low-frequency energy during the extended trough and the heatmap's strong red marking of that region, together with a large logit gap favoring label 1. An alternative plausible interpretation is label 0 (morphologically similar), but the heatmap and model logits favor label 1 decisively, so label 1 is selected as the most accurate classification.\"\n  ]\n}"

The three other assistants all labeled this sample as label 0, arguing the very large early spike plus trough+recovery pattern matches label_0.

Visually Sample 40 is also highly similar to this reference sample.\",\n        \"- Because both reference samples (one for label_0 and one for label_1) and both label summaries describe essentially the same canonical pattern (dominant low-frequency trough followed by recovery), Sample 40 legitimately matches the canonical patterns for both labels. We must therefore pick the label with the highest overall matching degree considering the magnitude of SHAP marking and the pattern emphasis in the label summaries.\",\n        \"\",\n        \"Rational for choosing label 1:\",\n        \"- The label_1 documentation explicitly calls out the deep negative valley at ~t=12\u201336 as the primary canonical feature and repeatedly emphasizes that the model relies heavily on the very-low-frequency energy in that time window (strong red) to classify label_1. In Sample 40 the deepest trough (t\u224815\u201334) is the strongest SHAP-marked block (strong red in the 0Hz row), matching that label_1 emphasis nearly exactly.\",\n        \"- While label_0 also lists the early spike + deep trough + recovery pattern, the label_1 description more strongly frames the deep trough at those time steps as the primary canonical fingerprint; the sample's strongest single SHAP block aligns with that descriptor. The recovery and plateau are also typical and reinforce the label_1 pattern.\",\n        \"- The early spike in Sample 40 is large (\u2248+3.3) and is slightly larger than some label_0 examples, and is comparable to label_1 reference examples that also contain large early spikes \u2014 this slightly favors label_1 but is not decisive by itself.

Justification: The sample also matches many label_0 features (early spike, deep trough, recovery), and reference sample 1 (label_0) is visually similar. However, the label_0 summary placed slightly more emphasis on early sharp spike being a dominant typical marker in some examples; in Sample 40 the single strongest SHAP block is the trough (matching label_1's described emphasis).

The early sharp positive transient has lower overall low-frequency energy than the trough (shorter duration).

Lowest-frequency rows during the recovery/hump (~t\u224840\u201360) are also red (moderately). The earliest transient shows mild red in very-low-frequency cells (supportive but smaller).

According to the provided rules, when red dominates the time\u2013frequency blocks that coincide with the main morphological events, the model considers these typical features for the predicted label. The blue/ambiguous markings are limited and occur primarily in intermediate frequencies and minor time blocks, so they do not meaningfully counter the model's strong positive attribution.\\n- Therefore the black-box model's high logit for label 1 is consistent with the heatmap: the model relies on strong low-frequency trough + recovery energy (marked red) to make its confident label-1 decision. This is not a borderline attribution in the model's view \u2014 it is a clear, typical pattern per the model's own explanations.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare to label summaries and other assistants' analyses:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 reference summaries describe similar morphologies (early positive transient \u2192 deep negative trough \u2192 recovery hump \u2192 late plateau). However, the label_1 summary repeatedly calls out the deep low-frequency trough (t\u224812\u201336) with strong 0Hz-row red as the canonical discriminative signature that the model uses to indicate label 1. In this sample the strongest SHAP block is precisely that trough at the 0Hz row.\\n- The three other assistants all predicted label 1 (two with high confidence scores, one moderate). Their stepwise analyses align with the same observations: deep broad trough (dominant low-frequency energy and strong SHAP red), recovery hump (red), and small intermediate-frequency jitter (minor, atypical). This independent agreement supports label 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final judgment about credibility and classification decision:\\n- The black-box model's label-1 prediction is highly credible: (a) the logits/softmax indicate extremely high confidence for label 1; (b) the SHAP heatmap attributes that decision to clearly identifiable, large-amplitude, low-frequency events (trough and recovery) that are marked as typical (red) by the model; (c) intermediate-frequency blue markings are small and do not outweigh the dominant typical features; (d) the morphological signature matches the canonical label-1 fingerprint described in the provided summaries and matches the other assistants' conclusions.\\n- This sample is not a borderline case for the model \u2014 according to the model's internal attributions it is treated as a typical label-1 instance. The small ambiguous/atypical intermediate-frequency contributions are present but minor.\\n\\nConclusion: Final classification = label 1. The black-box model's prediction of label 1 is credible and well-supported by the heatmap attributions and the time\u2013frequency/line-plot evidence. Other assistants' analyses agree and do not provide contradictory strong evidence for label 0.\"\n  ]\n}"

Heatmap-wise the early trough shows a partially atypical signature for label 0 (0Hz row blue, adjacent low-freq rows red), the transition shows mixed SHAP (ambiguous), and the mid/late plateau shows consistent red in low-frequency rows (typical for label 0).

The model heatmap consistently marks the trough and recovery/plateau (in the 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows) as strongly typical (red), while flagging the tiny early negative offset and some intermediate-frequency transition content as atypical/ambiguous (blue/mixed).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature lists and selection of label:\\n- Comparison to label-1 canonical pattern: Label 1's aggregated pattern is described as early small positive transient \u2192 pronounced deep low-frequency valley (t\u224812\u201336) \u2192 recovery crossing to positive hump \u2192 late-stage plateau or optional late spike. The decisive features the model uses for label-1 classification are the deep low-frequency valley and the recovery/positive plateau (strong red in 0Hz rows). Sample 41 matches this core pattern very closely: it has a broad deep valley at the expected early\u2013mid window, followed by a recovery to a sustained positive hump and a late positive peak \u2014 all marked as typical (red) in the low-frequency band.\\n- Comparison to label-0 canonical pattern: Label 0 also can present an early positive transient + deep trough + recovery + possible late peak. The main difference is that label-0 samples typically show an early sharp positive transient (t\u22648) as a common/typical feature. Sample 41 does not show that early positive spike; the early window is actually slightly negative and is marked atypical by the heatmap at 0Hz. Thus while the trough/recovery pattern is common to both labels, the absence of the typical early positive transient (and the SHAP-attributed atypical early window) reduces similarity to label 0.\\n- Given the strong low-frequency red attribution for the deep trough and the recovery/late hump (the core discriminative features described for label 1), and the heatmap marking the early time 0Hz cell as atypical (which makes the sample less like label 0 where that early positive spike is typical), the feature set of sample 41 aligns more closely with label 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Reference-sample cross-check and similarity scoring:\\n- Reference sample 1 (Label 0, sample 93): shows early small positive spike, deep trough, recovery, then plateau \u2014 low-frequency red in trough and recovery. Sample 41 shares the trough + recovery + plateau but differs by lacking the early positive spike. The SHAP early-time blue for sample 41 increases dissimilarity to label 0. Therefore similarity to label 0 is limited.\\n- Reference sample 2 (Label 1, sample 78): shows early small positive bump, strong deep trough (low-freq red), recovery to sustained plateau, and a diminishing late plateau \u2014 this pattern strongly resembles sample 41's trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 plateau/late peak. Although sample 41 lacks an early small positive bump, label 1 descriptions allow some variability in that early window (some label-1 samples also show ambiguous marking there). The dominant discriminative features (broad deep trough in low-frequency band and recovery/positive plateau with later positive event) are present and marked typical in sample 41, matching label 1 behaviour.\\n- Quantified similarity (final justification):\\n  - Label 1 similarity: 4 (High similarity). Rationale: The main model-identified features for label 1 (strong low-frequency deep trough then recovery to a positive hump/late peak) are present and marked red (typical). More than ~80% of the crucial pattern elements match label 1's description, and the STFT + SHAP align with the label-1 fingerprint.\\n  - Label 0 similarity: 2 (Low similarity). Rationale: While label 0 can include a trough+recovery pattern, it commonly includes an early sharp positive transient which is absent here and is in fact flagged as atypical by SHAP; intermediate-frequency ambiguities further reduce matching. Only the trough+recovery are shared, so similarity is limited (<50%).\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1. The sample's time-series morphology (broad low-frequency trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 sustained positive hump with a late positive peak) and the SHAP heatmap's red low-frequency attribution for these segments match the canonical label-1 pattern strongly; the early-time discrepancy is explicitly marked atypical and does not overturn the strong matching low-frequency features that define label 1.\"\n  ]\n}",

The heatmap actually highlights features that\u2014per the dataset descriptions\u2014are canonical for label 1. The presence of minor blue (atypical) spots (early 0Hz and some intermediate frequencies) is not enough to override the dominant red low-frequency blocks that match label 1\u2019s fingerprint.\\n\"\n    \"- Therefore the black-box classification is not well supported by the interpretable heatmap + STFT + line-plot evidence and is likely a misclassification in this case.

Volatility in this early window is low besides the sharp initial rise and quick fall.\\n   - Early-to-mid stage deep negative valley (t \u2248 8\u201334): A broad, smooth descent below zero beginning around t\u224810 and reaching the minimum near t\u224824\u201330 at about \u22122.0 to \u22122.3. Morphology: smooth, wide trough with low high-frequency jitter.\\n   - Mid recovery / positive hump (t \u2248 34\u201360): A fairly rapid recovery crossing y=0 near t\u224834\u201338 and settling into a sustained positive hump/plateau around +0.6 to +0.9 that persists through \u224840\u201360.

No late very-large spike (>2\u20133) is present.\\n\\n2. STFT (time-frequency) observations:\\n   - Strong energy concentrated in the very-low-frequency rows (0 Hz row and immediate adjacent low-frequency rows) during the trough time window roughly t\u224812\u201334 (consistent with a large, slow deviation).\\n   - Continued but lower low-frequency energy during the recovery/hump window (t\u224834\u201360).\\n   - Little spread into intermediate/high-frequency rows overall (very little high-frequency energy), indicating the main events are low-frequency (smooth) components with minimal jitter.\\n\\n3. SHAP heatmap observations (model contribution):\\n   - Very strong red block (high positive SHAP values) concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz and adjacent rows) during the trough time window (\u2248t\u224817\u201334). This indicates the model views the trough's low-frequency energy as a strongly typical, positive contributor to the predicted class.\\n   - Light-to-moderate red in lowest-frequency rows during the recovery/hump window (\u224834\u201360) \u2014 supportive but less intense than the trough.\\n   - The early positive transient (t\u22480\u20138) shows only weak or mild red (not a dominant red region) in the lowest-frequency rows \u2014 i.e., present but not the model's primary cue.\\n   - Late small fluctuations show faint/near-neutral SHAP contributions (minor light-red spots), and there are no substantial blue blocks anywhere in the map.\\n\\n4. Mapping features to typical/atypical per heatmap and dataset summaries:\\n   - Early positive transient (0\u20138): mild red in SHAP low-frequency rows \u2192 treated by the model as weakly typical/supportive (not decisive). Matches both labels morphologically but here not strongly emphasized.\\n   - Deep broad negative trough (\u22488\u201334): very strong red at 0Hz & adjacent low-frequency rows in SHAP \u2192 strongly typical according to the model. This is exactly the canonical, high-weight feature emphasized for label_1 in the provided summaries.\\n   - Mid recovery / positive hump (\u224834\u201360): light-to-moderate red at low-frequency rows \u2192 typical/supportive feature.\\n   - Late small-amplitude plateau/jitter (\u224860\u201395): near-neutral to weakly red at low frequencies \u2192 weakly typical or non-decisive.\\n   - Intermediate-frequency components and jitter: STFT shows minimal energy at intermediate/high frequencies and SHAP shows no strong blue there \u2192 no major atypical high-frequency signature.\\n   - Overall: heatmap red regions dominate in the trough and recovery low-frequency bands; blue (atypical) regions are absent or negligible. Therefore major features are considered typical by the model, not atypical or ambiguous.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Evaluate the black-box model's classification and logits in light of heatmap evidence:\\n\\n1. Model logits: [-3.3027079105377197, 3.929225444793701]. The logit for label 1 is much larger than for label 0 (difference \u2248 7.2319). Converting to probabilities yields an overwhelmingly high probability for label 1 (practically \u22480.999). This indicates the model is numerically very confident in its label-1 prediction.\\n\\n2. Heatmap concordance with logits: The SHAP heatmap shows large, focused red attribution in the lowest-frequency rows during the trough (the same time window the STFT marks as high-energy). According to the label summaries, label_1 treats a deep low-frequency trough (t\u224812\u201336) as its principal canonical, highly typical feature. The model's highest SHAP weights coincide with this region, so the model is basing its confident logit on a strongly-typical feature for label_1.\\n\\n3. Presence/absence of confusing features: There are no substantial blue regions in the SHAP heatmap (no large atypical markings). Intermediate-frequency spread (which would indicate jitter and create ambiguity) is minimal in the STFT and not highlighted as blue. The early spike exists in the waveform but is only weakly emphasized by SHAP (mild red), reducing risk that the model misinterprets an early-spike-dominant label_0 pattern.\\n\\n4. Conclusion on model confidence & sample status: Both the large logit gap and the SHAP heatmap (red-dominant in the trough region) indicate the model is confidently using typical label_1 features. This sample is not a borderline or confusing example for the model \u2014 it is a typical label_1 example from the model's perspective.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Combine with label feature summaries and the three assistants' analyses to select the most reasonable classification:\\n\\n1. Comparison to label summaries:\\n   - Label_1 canonical features (per provided summary): early small positive transient \u2192 pronounced deep low-frequency valley (t\u224812\u201336 as the primary canonical marker) \u2192 recovery to positive hump \u2192 late plateau or optional late spike. The model's SHAP emphasis on the trough at 0Hz matches this exactly.\\n   - Label_0 can show similar morphology in some examples (early spike + trough + recovery), but label_0 examples often have cases where the early spike is a stronger typical cue or where additional atypical intermediate-frequency components are present. In this sample the early spike is not strongly weighted by the model, and intermediate-frequency spread is minimal \u2014 so the pattern aligns more with label_1.\\n\\n2. Agreement with external analyses: All three independent assistant analyses concluded label 1 with high similarity scores and used the same reasoning: the deep trough's strong low-frequency SHAP attribution is the decisive cue pointing to label 1. Their reasoning, the STFT, the SHAP map, and the model logits are consistent.\\n\\n3. Therefore the most reasonable classification is label 1 (normal heartbeat). The black-box model's prediction and the assistants' consensus all agree and are supported by the heatmap's dominant typical regions.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final verification and sanity checks:\\n\\n1. Re-check for overlooked patterns: There is no large late secondary spike (which sometimes appears in label_0 references), no strong intermediate/high-frequency energy (no jitter-driven ambiguity), and no blue-dominant heatmap regions. The early spike, though prominent in amplitude, is not treated by the model as the main cue (weak SHAP), so it does not overturn the trough-based evidence.\\n\\n2. Error risk assessment: Given the very large logit margin, the focused SHAP attribution on a canonical label_1 feature, and the consensus among independent analyses, the risk that the model is confidently wrong is low. Any residual uncertainty would derive from the fact both labels can share similar morphological sequences, but the SHAP emphasis disambiguates here in favor of label_1.\\n\\nFinal conclusion: Predicted label is label 1 (normal heartbeat). The black-box model's classification is credible and well-supported by both the model's strong logit margin and the SHAP heatmap showing dominant red (typical) attribution at the deep low-frequency trough and supportive recovery region. Independent assistant analyses concur with label 1.\"\n  ]\n}"

Still, the early spike produces some low-frequency energy.\\n- SHAP heatmap: the very-low-frequency rows at the early window show light-red to red shading (typical contribution).\\n- Interpretation: Early sharp positive transient is present and marked as a typical feature (red) in the lowest-frequency components.\\n\\n2) Early-to-mid stage trough (t \u2248 8\u201334):\\n- Line plot: a broad deep negative valley starting ~t=8, reaching a minimum around -2.0 to -2.3 in the t\u224820\u201330 window, smooth morphology (gradual descent and slow recovery) occupying many time steps.\\n- STFT: very strong energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows during ~t=15\u201335 (bright yellow/green region), consistent with a large low-frequency deflection.\\n- SHAP heatmap: the lowest-frequency rows during ~t=15\u201334 are strongly red (high positive SHAP), indicating the model treats this trough\u2019s low-frequency energy as a highly typical feature.\\n- Interpretation: The deep negative trough is present and is a strongly typical feature (red) in the 0Hz / very-low-frequency band.\\n\\n3) Mid recovery / positive hump (t \u2248 34\u201360):\\n- Line plot: recovery begins ~t\u224834, ramps up crossing y=0 around ~t=36\u201340 and reaches a sustained positive hump/plateau around t\u224842\u201352 with amplitude ~0.8\u20131.2, then slowly decays toward baseline while retaining small positive values.\\n- STFT: moderate low-frequency energy during this recovery/hump window (0Hz and adjacent low-freq rows) and some lower-magnitude contribution in adjacent rows.\\n- SHAP heatmap: the low-frequency rows in the mid-recovery window are mostly red (typical). I also note a small localized blue patch in a narrow low-frequency cell in the later mid window (suggesting a small ambiguous/atypical component), but the dominant marking is red for the mid-recovery block.\\n- Interpretation: Recovery/hump is present and predominantly a typical low-frequency feature; a very small ambiguous/atypical element exists but is not dominant.\\n\\n4) Late stage (t \u2248 60\u201395):\\n- Line plot: after the plateau there is a gradual decline to near-zero with mild fluctuations and small negative/near-zero oscillations in the last ~t=80\u201395 window; no very large late spike (>+3) is present.\\n- STFT: low energy overall in late windows; weak low-frequency content and negligible high-frequency spread.\\n- SHAP heatmap: late low-frequency cells are lightly red in some places (supportive/typical) and otherwise near neutral; there is not a dominant blue signature at late times.\\n- Interpretation: Late-stage low-amplitude plateau / small fluctuations are weakly typical or neutral; no strong atypical late spike.\\n\\n5) Intermediate-frequency / high-frequency content:\\n- Line plot & STFT: transitions appear relatively smooth; there is not large, sustained high-frequency jitter. STFT shows the main energy concentrated at the lowest freq rows; only minor energy in intermediate rows.\\n- SHAP: intermediate-frequency rows show small amounts of blue in some localized mid windows (indicating the model treats any small jitter/fast components there as slightly atypical), but these are minor compared with the red low-frequency blocks.\\n- Interpretation: Intermediate-frequency spread is minimal and where present is lightly atypical/ambiguous, but not a dominant feature.\\n\\nSummary of Step 1: Sample 44 contains the canonical sequence: early sharp positive spike (\u2248+3.1, t\u22482\u20134) -> broad deep negative trough (\u2248-2.0 to -2.3, t\u224815\u201330) -> smooth recovery to a positive hump (\u2248+0.8\u20131.2, t\u224840\u201350) -> late gentle plateau/decay. The SHAP heatmap marks the very-low-frequency rows for the trough and recovery as strongly red (typical). Early spike low-frequency components are also red (typical). Small intermediate-frequency patches are lightly blue (atypical) but minor.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern summary for Sample 44\\n\\n- Phase 1 (early): sharp positive transient, strongly present and marked typical (red in low-freq rows).\\n- Phase 2 (early-mid): large, broad negative trough (dominant event), strong low-frequency energy and strongly red SHAP in 0Hz/very-low-frequency rows (highly typical).\\n- Phase 3 (mid): recovery and sustained positive hump/plateau, low-frequency energy marked mostly red (typical) with a small ambiguous cell.\\n- Phase 4 (late): low-amplitude plateau and mild decay / small oscillations, mostly neutral to mildly red (weakly typical). No very large late spike or dramatic high-frequency jitter.\\n\\nOverall pattern label: early spike + deep low-frequency trough + smooth recovery + late mild plateau; low-frequency bands across these main events are predominantly red in the SHAP heatmap (i.e., treated as typical by the model). Intermediate-frequency blue patches exist but are peripheral.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists\\n\\n- Compare to label_0 (myocardial infarction event) feature list: label_0 is described as having an early sharp positive transient (t\u22648), an early-to-mid deep negative valley (t\u22488\u201330) with dominant low-frequency energy, a mid recovery/positive hump (t\u224830\u201360) dominated by low-frequency, and optional late secondary positive peak or sustained plateau. Label_0 also notes that intermediate-frequency spread during transitions is often atypical (blue) \u2014 matching Sample 44's minor intermediate blue patches.\\n- Compare to label_1 (normal heartbeat) feature list: label_1 also describes early positive transient \u2192 deep valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 late plateau or optional late spike, with the deep valley's low-frequency energy marked as typical. Therefore, many gross morphological features are shared across both labels.\\n\\nKey distinctions and reasoning in favor of label_0 for Sample 44:\\n- The combination and SHAP marking: For Sample 44 the early sharp positive transient is strongly marked red in the low-frequency rows (label_0 notes this as typical), the early-mid deep negative trough is strongly red in the 0Hz/low-frequency rows (a hallmark for both labels, but label_0 reference samples emphasize the early sharp spike + pronounced trough sequence). The mid recovery low-frequency block is red (again consistent with label_0 typical signature). The presence of some small intermediate-frequency blue regions during transitions is explicitly described for label_0 as being common and considered atypical, which matches this sample's SHAP pattern.\\n- Reference sample comparison: Reference sample 1 (Label 0) shows a very similar sequence and magnitudes: early high positive transient (~+2 to +2.3), broad trough to \u2248-2.0, recovery hump to \u2248+0.6\u20131.0 and a mostly smooth mid-phase; its STFT and SHAP show the same dominant low-frequency red during trough and recovery. Sample 44 matches reference sample 1 closely in morphology, energy localization, and SHAP low-frequency red pattern. Reference sample 2 (Label 1) is also similar morphologically, but label_1 reference samples sometimes include late very large positive spikes (sample 19 in the label_1 set) or specific small 0Hz blue anomalies in some windows; Sample 44 does not present a large late spike and instead aligns closely with the label_0 example.\\n\\nTherefore Sample 44's feature set and heatmap marking more closely match the label_0 canonical description (early sharp positive peak + pronounced low-frequency trough + smooth low-frequency recovery + minor intermediate-frequency jitter marked atypical) and is visually and spectrally highly similar to the provided label_0 reference sample.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final verification and similarity scoring\\n\\n- Degree of match to label_0: The major, discriminative features enumerated for label_0 are present in Sample 44: early sharp positive transient (present & typical), broad deep negative trough with dominant low-frequency energy (present & strongly typical), mid recovery positive hump in low-frequency band (present & typical), and minor intermediate-frequency patches during transitions (present & marked atypical in the heatmap, as described for label_0). At least 80% of the label_0 feature list matches in both manifestation and SHAP typicality. I therefore assign a high similarity score of 4 (High similarity).\\n- Degree of match to label_1: while label_1 shares the broad valley\u2192recovery morphology and would receive a moderate similarity rating (several key features match), subtle differences in the SHAP/feature description and the close resemblance to the provided label_0 reference (in both magnitude and SHAP red pattern) make label_0 the stronger match. If asked to score label_1 similarity I would give 3 (moderate) because the core valley/recovery pattern is shared but label_1 has other exemplar behaviors (e.g., frequent late-large spikes in some samples) that are not present here.\\n\\nConclusion: Assign Sample 44 to label 0 (myocardial infarction event) with high similarity (score = 4) because the sample shows the canonical label_0 pattern: an early sharp positive transient, a dominant low-frequency broad negative trough, and a smooth low-frequency recovery \u2014 and the SHAP heatmap marks those low-frequency regions predominantly red (typical) while marking minor intermediate-frequency transition components as slightly atypical (blue), exactly matching the label_0 pattern and the provided label_0 reference sample.\"\n  ]\n}",

This is a sharp early positive bump in amplitude.\\n- Early\u2013mid stage (t \u2248 8\u201334): A prolonged negative descent developing after the early fall and reaching the largest negative excursion around t\u224828\u201332 at roughly \u22122.0 to \u22122.3. The descent is broad and relatively smooth (a wide trough lasting many time steps rather than a single narrow spike).\\n- Mid stage (t \u2248 34\u201355): A pronounced recovery that crosses baseline around t\u224836\u201340 and rises to a sustained positive hump/plateau with peak \u2248 +1.0\u2013+1.3 around t\u224844\u201348. The recovery is fairly smooth with modest local variability.\\n- Late stage (t \u2248 55\u201395): A long low-amplitude positive plateau gradually decaying toward zero and slightly negative near t\u224885\u201395, with a modest uptick at the very end (t\u224895). There is no very large abrupt late spike (no large >3 late peak).\\n\\nTime\u2013frequency (STFT) observations:\\n- Very-strong low-frequency energy (brightest color) concentrated in the early\u2013mid trough time window (roughly t\u224815\u201334) at the lowest-frequency rows. This corresponds to the broad deep negative valley.\\n- Moderate low-frequency energy during the mid recovery window (t\u224834\u201355) at the lowest-frequency rows (consistent with the smooth recovery/hump).\\n- Little energy (near background) in the later windows (t>80) across frequencies.\\n- High/intermediate frequencies overall show very limited energy; transitions have small intermediate-frequency content but it is not dominant.\\n\\nSHAP heatmap observations (feature importance & typicality):\\n- The strongest red block (high positive SHAP \u2014 i.e., strongly typical for the model's predicted label) is at the lowest-frequency rows (0Hz and adjacent lowest-freq rows) during the early\u2013mid trough window (approx t\u224815\u201334). This indicates the model regards the deep negative trough's low-frequency energy as a strongly typical feature.\\n- The mid-recovery (t\u224834\u201355) low-frequency rows show light-to-moderate red, indicating this recovery/hump is also considered typical (but somewhat less strongly than the trough itself).\\n- The early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20138) shows weaker/near-neutral to light-red coding in the lowest-frequency rows (i.e., it is present but not as strongly highlighted by the heatmap as the trough block).\\n- Intermediate-frequency rows (mid frequencies) contain patches of faint blue in some transition windows (e.g., some slight negative SHAP coloring around transition times), indicating those higher-frequency jitter components are regarded as atypical or ambiguous by the model.\\n\\nConclusion of Step 1 \u2014 feature-type labeling:\\n- Early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20138, +3.0 amplitude): present; SHAP: weak-to-mildly-typical (light red/neutral). => Typical/ supportive but not the single strongest cue.\\n- Broad deep negative trough (t\u22488\u201334, down to \u2248\u22122.2): present; SHAP: strongly red at 0Hz low-frequency rows. => Strongly typical feature.\\n- Mid recovery positive hump (t\u224834\u201355, \u2248+1.0\u2013+1.3): present; SHAP: light-to-moderate red at low frequencies. => Typical/ supportive.\\n- Late small plateau/small fluctuations (t>55): present; SHAP: near-neutral to slightly red in low freq occasionally \u2014 weakly typical.\\n- Intermediate/high-frequency jitter: present only faintly during transitions; SHAP: faint blue in some intermediate rows => considered atypical/ambiguous by the model.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Summarize the sample's feature pattern (phase-by-phase):\\n- Pattern sequence: Early sharp positive transient \u2192 Broad deep negative trough (dominant) \u2192 Smooth recovery crossing baseline into sustained positive hump \u2192 Long low-amplitude late plateau with slight decay.\\n- Heatmap-annotated typicality: The deep trough's low-frequency energy is the dominant typical signature (strong red). The recovery hump is also treated as typical (light red). The early positive spike is present and weakly supported (light red/neutral). Small intermediate-frequency jitter during transitions is flagged as atypical (blue patches) but is minor relative to the low-frequency blocks.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to the provided label patterns:\\n- Label 1 canonical pattern (from provided summaries): early small/short positive transient (~t0\u20138) + pronounced low-frequency deep valley (~t12\u201336) + recovery crossing baseline to positive hump (~t36\u201355) + optional low-amplitude plateau or occasional late spike. The model marks the deep-valley in low-frequency rows as the main typical fingerprint for label 1.\\n- Label 0 canonical pattern (from provided summaries): early sharp positive transient (t\u22648) + early-mid deep negative valley (t\u22488\u201330) + mid recovery/hump (t\u224830\u201360) + sometimes a late secondary peak. Many features overlap with label 1, but the provided label-1 description emphasizes the valley\u2192recovery\u2192plateau as the canonical fingerprint and shows many examples where the trough low-frequency block is the strongest typical marker.\\n\\nComparison: The sample's sequence matches the label-1 canonical sequence almost exactly in timing and morphology: early positive spike, broad trough centered in the early\u2013mid window, smooth recovery into a sustained positive hump, then late low-amplitude plateau. Crucially, the SHAP heatmap places the strongest positive attribution (red) on the trough low-frequency block, which the label-1 descriptions explicitly list as the model's principal typical fingerprint. Although label-0 also contains similar components in some examples, the emphasis in the provided summaries for label-1 is the trough as the primary typical marker (0Hz red), and the sample's SHAP most strongly highlights that same trough-lowfreq block.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples:\\n- Reference sample 99 (Label 1) is visually very close to the test sample: large early positive transient (~+3.3), broad deep negative valley down to ~-2.1 in roughly the same time window, recovery to a mid positive hump \u2248+1.0\u2013+1.3 and similar plateau. Its STFT and heatmap also emphasize the trough low-frequency block. The test sample's STFT & SHAP pattern are highly similar to this label-1 reference.\\n- Reference sample 35 (Label 0) also shares the same general three-part morphology (early positive spike, broad trough, recovery hump). However, in the label-0 reference the early spike and sometimes a later secondary spike are stronger model-attributed typical cues in that class' examples. In the test sample the strongest model attribution is on the trough low-frequency block (matching label-1 emphasis), and there is no large late secondary spike; this aligns the test sample more to label 1.\\n\\nSimilarity scoring justification:\\n- Matched key features to label 1: early positive transient (present), pronounced broad trough in the canonical trough time window with strong low-frequency red (present & strongly typical), recovery hump with low-frequency red (present), late low-amplitude plateau (present, weakly typical). That is >80% of the main listed label-1 features matched including the most discriminative one (trough low-frequency red). Reference sample 99 (label 1) is visually and spectrally very similar. Therefore similarity = 4 (high similarity).\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1. Reasoning summary in one line: The sample exhibits the canonical label-1 morphology (early transient \u2192 strong broad trough \u2192 smooth recovery \u2192 plateau) and the SHAP heatmap places the strongest typical attribution on the trough's lowest-frequency rows \u2014 exactly the model fingerprint used to identify label 1 in the provided summaries and the label-1 reference sample.\"\n    ]\n}",

Intermediate-frequency spread during transition shows small blue patches (atypical/ambiguous). The model\u2019s main support signal is the deep low-frequency trough and subsequent recovery.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Step 3 \u2014 mapping the sample pattern to label feature lists and deciding which label matches best:\\n\"\n        \"- Both label descriptions (label_0 and label_1) share the canonical morphological sequence early-bump \u2192 deep valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 plateau. The crucial discriminating element from the feature lists is how the model treats the deep trough / low-frequency block and the prominence of early sharp spike in the heatmap.\\n\"\n        \"- Label 1 (myocardial infarction = normal heartbeat? per dataset mapping label 1 = normal heartbeat) feature list emphasizes: a pronounced deep negative valley at t\u224812\u201336 with strong low-frequency energy and the model treating that low-frequency valley as the primary canonical typical feature (red). Label 1 reference samples (e.g., Sample 99) show very similar line-shape and SHAP low-frequency red pattern concentrated on the trough and recovery.\\n\"\n        \"- Label 0 also lists a similar sequence, but in the provided label_0 examples the early sharp positive transient is often explicitly marked as a strongly typical low-frequency red feature in many label_0 reference samples. In this test sample the trough's low-frequency region is the clearest red block, while the earliest large positive transient is not as strongly highlighted in the heatmap (ambiguous/weak). This shifts the pattern match toward the label whose canonical, strongly-typical marker is the trough region \u2014 which is label 1 in the provided summaries.\\n\"\n        \"- Additionally, comparing the sample visually to the two reference samples: the test sample's waveform is highly similar to Reference sample 2 (Sample 99, Label 1): both have the same huge early spike, deep broad trough centered in the early\u2013mid phase, and a smooth recovery / sustained mid positive hump; their STFT/SHAP patterns similarly focus model importance on the trough low-frequency block. Reference sample 1 (Sample 35, Label 0) has similar elements too but label_0 references often show stronger model attribution tied to the early spike as well as some differing intermediate-frequency attributions.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Conclusion of Step 3: The test sample's strongest matching element is the deep, low-frequency trough (t\u224812\u201334) marked strongly red in the heatmap and the recovery hump that follows. This set of features and the heatmap attribution pattern is described in detail as the canonical, typical fingerprint for label 1 in the provided label summaries. Therefore the sample is best classified as label 1.\\n\\n\"\n        \"Step 4 \u2014 verification against references and final confidence scoring:\\n\"\n        \"- Similarity to label 1: High. The primary hallmark for label 1 (a pronounced deep negative valley dominated by very-low-frequency energy at t\u224812\u201336 which the model marks red) is present and strongly marked in this test sample. Recovery/hump and late plateau are present as in label 1 samples. Visual similarity to Reference Sample 99 (Label 1) is high both in waveform morphology and in the SHAP heatmap emphasis. I assign a high-similarity score of 4 for label 1.\\n\"\n        \"- Similarity to label 0: Moderate. Many morphological elements overlap (early spike + deep trough + recovery), but the heatmap emphasis on the early spike (which often appeared as a strongly-typical red block for label 0 reference samples) is weaker here; the model instead highlights the trough as the dominant typical feature. That reduces the match to label 0 relative to label 1, therefore label 0 would be scored lower (not chosen).\\n\\n\"\n        \"Final decision and justification (concise):\\n\"\n        \"- Predicted label: label 1.\\n\"\n        \"- Rationale summary: The model's SHAP heatmap strongly highlights the deep early\u2013mid trough in the very-low-frequency rows as a typical (red) feature \u2014 this trough + recovery pattern is the canonical, most discriminative fingerprint described for label 1. The early spike is present but not strongly marked as typical by the heatmap, which favors label 1 over label 0. The test sample also closely matches Reference Sample 99 (Label 1) in waveform and attribution, supporting a high-confidence classification. Hence label 1 with a similarity score 4 (high similarity).\"\n    ]\n}"

That red dominance in the trough region supports the model\u2019s confident label-1 prediction. The blue/ambiguous intermediate-frequency patches are present but minor compared with the large red trough block, so they do not substantially undermine the model\u2019s strong decision.\\n\"\n    \"- Boundary vs typical sample: Because a single, large low-frequency trough block is strongly red and corresponds to the canonical, model-typical trough\u2192recovery fingerprint described for label 1, this is not primarily a boundary/ambiguous sample.

The two label-1 analyses emphasized that the SHAP heatmap\u2019s dominant red is on the trough block, while the label-0 analysis emphasized morphological similarity to label-0 references but gave less weight to the heatmap attribution.

There is further low-frequency energy during the recovery/hump window (~t\u224836\u201360). The early large positive transient produces some low-frequency energy at the start but is not the dominant red block in the heatmap. There is only limited spread into intermediate-frequency rows (some small energy during transitions), i.e. jitter is mild.\\n- SHAP heatmap (typical/atypical markings): The strongest red (typical) region is in the 0 Hz / lowest-frequency row during the deep negative-valley time block (~t\u224815\u201335). Adjacent low-frequency rows in the same time window are also mildly red (typical). The early positive transient time window shows only weak-to-moderate red in very-low-frequency rows (so it is not as dominantly marked typical as the valley). Some intermediate-frequency cells during the transition period show light blue (slightly atypical/ambiguous), but these blue markings are sparse and not dominant. Later in the recovery/hump window there are light red low-frequency cells (mildly typical). Conclusion about each feature type from heatmap: \\n  - Early large positive transient (t\u22481\u20134): present, but only weak-to-moderate low-frequency red \u2192 mildly typical/ambiguous. \\n  - Deep negative valley (t\u22488\u201332): strongly marked red in 0Hz and adjacent low-freq rows \u2192 clearly a typical feature. \\n  - Recovery / mid positive hump (t\u224836\u201360): low-frequency rows are light red \u2192 typical (supportive). \\n  - Intermediate-frequency jitter during transitions: light blue in some cells \u2192 atypical/ambiguous but minor. \\n  - Late small bump (t\u224872\u201378): weak low-frequency red \u2192 mildly typical/supportive.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern summary for the sample:\\n- The sample follows the canonical sequence: early positive transient \u2192 pronounced deep low-frequency negative valley \u2192 recovery crossing baseline to a sustained positive hump \u2192 late low-amplitude plateau/small bump. The heatmap indicates the model treats the deep negative valley as the strongest, most typical discriminative feature (strong red at 0Hz row in the valley window). Early transient and late hump are supportive but less strongly weighted; intermediate-frequency spread (small jitter) is minor and slightly atypical in parts.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare to the provided label feature lists/patterns:\\n- Label 1 (normal heartbeat) signature: early small positive transient, a pronounced deep low-frequency valley (primary canonical marker), recovery to a positive hump/plateau, optional late spike \u2014 model strongly relies on low-frequency valley as key. The sample matches this pattern very well: prominent deep valley with very-low-frequency red is the dominant SHAP signature, followed by recovery/hump and modest late activity. The sequence and which time\u2013frequency components are marked typical (strong red at lowest-frequency rows during the valley) match label 1's canonical description.\\n- Label 0 (myocardial infarction) signature: includes an early sharp positive transient + early-to-mid deep negative trough + mid recovery hump, and the model often treats the early sharp positive transient as a clear typical marker for label 0 in reference label-0 examples. In the current sample the early positive transient is large in amplitude, which superficially resembles label-0 examples; however, the heatmap in this sample does not mark that early spike as the dominant strongly-typical region \u2014 instead the deep valley region is the dominant red block. Thus although there is overlap with label-0 features, the strongest pattern match (deep low-frequency valley dominance) aligns better with label 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision:\\n- Reference sample 82 (label 1) shows a very similar sequence and SHAP emphasis: large early positive bump followed by deep low-frequency valley, then recovery and plateau; the heatmap emphasis for that reference is likewise on the valley low-frequency rows. Sample 46's dominant SHAP red block coincides with the valley region, just as in the label-1 reference. \\n- Reference sample 35 (label 0) also contains early positive spike + deep trough + recovery, but in label-0 examples the early spike and late events are sometimes more strongly emphasized as typical. In sample 46 the valley is unequivocally the main typical marker according to SHAP, and intermediate-frequency jitter is minor; this pattern is more consistent with the label-1 canonical description.\\n\\nConclusion and confidence scoring:\\n- Final predicted label: label 1 (normal heartbeat). Rationale: the sample's strongest discriminative region (deep negative valley) is marked strongly red at the very-low-frequency rows, matching the canonical, model-weighted valley\u2192recovery pattern described for label 1. Early spike is present but not the model's primary typical marker here, reducing support for label 0.\\n- Similarity score (sample vs chosen label 1): 4 (High similarity). Justification: the main features (>80%) \u2014 pronounced deep low-frequency valley, low-frequency recovery/hump, and the valley being strongly marked as typical \u2014 align closely with the label-1 pattern and the label-1 reference sample. Minor differences (large early spike amplitude, small intermediate-frequency jitter) are present but do not outweigh the dominant valley signature.\\n\\nOverall: sample 46 is classified as label 1 with high confidence because the model's SHAP heatmap shows the deep valley at the lowest-frequency rows is the dominant typical feature, and the sequence (valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 plateau) matches the canonical label-1 pattern and the label-1 reference.\"\n    ]\n}",

Estimated typical model behavior for these boundary cases: predicted opposite class probability often in the 0.6\u20130.8 range (logit margin on the order of ~0.4\u20131.2 in favor of the incorrect class) depending on which low-frequency cells dominate; given the mixed-but-typical SHAP here the model may still be nudged to the wrong label but with slightly lower margin than the most extreme examples.\\n\\nFinal judgment: the sample's morphology and time-frequency energy are a close match to the label_0 misclassification pattern (early positive spike + mid deep trough + late plateau).

From \u224834\u201344 the signal rises smoothly, crosses baseline near \u224836\u201340 and reaches a mid positive hump/plateau centered \u224843\u201352 (amplitude \u2248 +0.6\u2013+0.95). After \u224855 there is a sustained low-amplitude plateau with small fluctuations and slight decline toward zero by the end (minor negative jitters around t\u224880\u201395).\\n- Time-frequency image (STFT): Energy is concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz and adjacent low frequencies) during two main time blocks: the deep negative valley (roughly t\u224812\u201334) and the subsequent recovery/hump block (\u224834\u201355). The early positive transient also produces low-frequency energy at the earliest time steps. Intermediate-frequency energy is visible but weaker and more concentrated during transition windows (mid-phase), indicating mild higher-frequency components during the ramp-up.\\n- SHAP heatmap (model contribution): The heatmap marks the low-frequency (0 Hz and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows) region during the deep trough (t\u224812\u201334) as strongly red \u2014 indicating the model treats that trough\u2019s low-frequency energy as a typical feature. The early positive transient has low-frequency red markings as well (early time columns show light-to-moderate red across low-frequency rows), i.e. typical. During transitions/recovery there are light-blue patches in some intermediate-frequency rows (mid frequencies ~0.2\u20130.3) indicating the model regards those intermediate-frequency components (small jitters/oscillations) as atypical or ambiguous. The later plateau/hump window (\u224843\u201375) shows mostly light-red in the low-frequency rows (treated as typical). Late small negative jitters near the end have very weak or neutral markings.\\n- Feature classification by heatmap color:\\n  - Early large positive transient (t\u22480\u20136): low-frequency red \u2192 typical.\\n  - Deep negative valley (t\u224812\u201334): very strong low-frequency red \u2192 strongly typical.\\n  - Mid recovery / positive hump (t\u224834\u201355): low-frequency light-red \u2192 typical / supportive.\\n  - Intermediate-frequency spread / jitter during transitions (t\u224830\u201350): light-blue in intermediate rows \u2192 atypical / ambiguous.\\n  - Late small plateau / minor negative jitter (t>55): weak low-frequency red or neutral \u2192 weakly typical or neutral.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Summarized feature pattern for the sample:\\n- Early stage (t\u22480\u20138): pronounced early positive spike (typical; low-frequency red) followed by a small negative dip.\\n- Early\u2013mid stage (t\u224810\u201334): broad, deep negative trough (dominant feature), with very strong low-frequency SHAP red \u2014 identified by the model as a canonical, typical feature.\\n- Mid stage (t\u224834\u201355): smooth recovery crossing baseline into a sustained positive hump (low-frequency red \u2192 typical), though transitions contain some intermediate-frequency jitter (marked blue \u2192 atypical / confusing contribution).\\n- Late stage (t>55): low-amplitude plateau with small fluctuations; low-frequency rows mildly red or neutral (weakly typical).\\nOverall pattern: early positive spike \u2192 pronounced low-frequency deep trough \u2192 smooth recovery to positive plateau \u2192 late low-amplitude plateau. The model\u2019s heatmap indicates the trough (lowest-frequency energy) is the primary typical feature driving classification; intermediate-frequency jitter during transitions is considered atypical/ambiguous.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists and patterns:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 descriptions contain very similar canonical morphological sequences (early positive transient, deep negative valley ~t\u22488\u201330, recovery to positive hump ~t\u224830\u201360, late plateau or occasional late spike). Thus morphology alone is ambiguous. The decisive information is the heatmap mapping of which time-frequency components the model regards as typical.\\n- For this sample the strongest SHAP red signal is concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows during the deep negative valley (t\u224812\u201334) and during recovery; the early positive transient and later plateau are also judged typical (low-frequency red). These patterns (dominant low-frequency trough + recovery with low-frequency red in the trough window) are explicitly described in the label_1 summary as the canonical fingerprint the model relies on. Label_1 reference narratives emphasize the deep low-frequency valley at \u2248t12\u201336 being the main typical marker. Label_0 also lists similar features, but the provided label_1 references (and Reference sample 69) are especially close in both amplitude and timing to the sample under analysis.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision:\\n- Reference sample 69 (label 1) is highly similar in waveform shape and timing: large early positive peak, deep trough reaching about -2 around t\u224825\u201330, then smooth recovery to a mid positive plateau \u2014 STFT and SHAP patterns of that reference show concentrated low-frequency energy in the trough and recovery windows (matching this sample). The sample\u2019s SHAP pattern (strong red at the trough low-frequency rows, light-blue intermediate-frequency markings during transition) aligns closely with the label_1 description and with reference sample 69.\\n- Reference sample 35 (label 0) is also similar in global shape, but the match to sample 50 is slightly closer to reference 69 (label 1) in amplitude profile, timing of trough and recovery, and in the way the heatmap highlights the trough and recovery as typical. Importantly, the model\u2019s SHAP red emphasis on the trough low-frequency block is more consistently described in the label_1 documentation as the core canonical feature.\\n\\nConclusion and confidence score:\\n- Final classification: label 1.\\n- Confidence / similarity score: 4 (High similarity). Rationale for score: The sample exhibits the main canonical features (>80% match) described for label 1: a prominent early positive transient, a deep broad low-frequency trough (strongly red on SHAP) in the same time window used by the model to define label 1, and a smooth low-frequency recovery to a positive plateau that is also marked typical. The only minor mismatches are intermediate-frequency jitters during transitions (marked blue, i.e., atypical), but these are secondary and expected. The sample\u2019s waveform, STFT energy distribution, and SHAP-marked typical regions closely mirror label_1 reference patterns (notably Reference sample 69), which justifies a high-similarity rating and confident assignment to label 1.\"\n  ]\n}",

There are localized light-blue (negative SHAP) patches in some intermediate-frequency rows around transition times, indicating the model treats higher-frequency jitter/oscillatory components as atypical or ambiguous, but these blue regions are weaker and not dominant.\",\n    \"4) Feature-type labelling (typical/atypical/ambiguous):\",\n    \"- Early large positive transient (t\u22480\u20136): present; low-frequency SHAP is red/light-red \u2014 model treats it as typical in the current prediction (though label summaries mention this feature is more emphasized for label 0 in some references).\",\n    \"- Broad deep negative trough (t\u224810\u201334): present and strongly red at 0 Hz/adjacent low-frequency rows \u2014 typical and strongly weighted by the model.\",\n    \"- Mid recovery / positive hump (t\u224834\u201355): present and light-red at low-frequency rows \u2014 treated as typical/supportive.\",\n    \"- Intermediate-frequency spread / jitter (during transitions): weak blue patches in intermediate rows \u2014 atypical/ambiguous contributions but limited in size.\",\n    \"- Late plateau: neutral to faintly red in low-frequency rows \u2014 weakly typical or neutral.\",\n    \"Summary of Step 1: The model's heatmap indicates that the dominant events (trough + recovery and early transient) are treated as typical because red low-frequency blocks dominate the relevant time windows; only modest, localized blue appears in intermediate frequencies during transitions (secondary / downweighted).\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Evaluate model logits and confidence, and whether this is a boundary case:\",\n    \"1) Logits: [-3.4436, 3.8047] strongly favor label 1. Converting to probabilities (softmax) yields an overwhelmingly large probability for label 1 (near 1.0). The black-box model is numerically highly confident in its label 1 prediction.\",\n    \"2) Heatmap vs logits: The SHAP heatmap supports that confidence \u2014 large red blocks in the core trough/recovery low-frequency band (and red for the early transient) are typical features the model uses to support the predicted label. The blue/atypical regions are small and confined to intermediate frequencies during transitions, so they do not contradict the model's strong decision.\",\n    \"3) Boundary assessment: Although the waveform morphology (early positive transient \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery hump) is shared across label descriptions and can be ambiguous, the model's internal explanation shows it treats the most discriminative low-frequency energy (trough + recovery and early low-freq signature) as typical for the chosen label. Given the very large logit difference and predominance of red in decisive low-frequency regions, this sample is not presented as a weak/borderline decision for the black-box model \u2014 it is a confident internal decision. However, because both labels' summaries include similar low-frequency trough + recovery signatures, morphological ambiguity exists at the human/external-reference level even if the model is confident.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Combine with label summaries and other assistants' analyses:\",\n    \"1) Reference summaries: Both label_0 and label_1 descriptions include the sequence early bump \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery hump; label_0 references emphasize an especially sharp/large early positive transient as characteristic in many examples, while label_1 references emphasize the deep trough as the main canonical marker. In the provided summaries the trough + recovery low-frequency signature is repeatedly highlighted as the key typical fingerprint for label_1, and the heatmap for this sample strongly highlights that trough/recovery region.\",\n    \"2) Three assistants: Two assistants (Rounds 1 and 3) concluded label 0, basing their decisions on the very sharp, large early spike being characteristic for label 0. One assistant (Round 2) concluded label 1, using a similar heatmap-based rationale to emphasize the low-frequency trough + recovery as canonical for label 1. All three highlighted the same primary waveform events; their disagreement stems from which event (very-sharp early spike vs. trough/recovery weighting) they consider decisive.\",\n    \"3) Weighing evidence: The black-box model assigns very large positive SHAP weight to the trough/recovery low-frequency block (a canonical label_1 marker per the summaries) and also treats the early spike as supportive (red at low frequencies) rather than contradictory. The model's internals therefore align more with the label_1-supporting description in this particular decision. Given the model's strong numeric confidence and heatmap-consistent typical features, its prediction is credible despite human ambiguity.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Final judgment and verification:\",\n    \"1) Final classification choice: label 1. Rationale: The black-box model is numerically highly confident (large positive logit for label 1), and the SHAP heatmap shows red-dominated low-frequency contributions in the decisive trough\u2192recovery window (and supportive low-frequency contribution for the early spike). These red regions correspond to the canonical, model-typical features described for label_1 in the dataset documentation. The small blue patches in intermediate frequencies indicate localized atypical jitter but are minor relative to the broad red blocks driving the decision.\",\n    \"2) Uncertainty notes: Human analysts can reasonably argue for label 0 because the early transient is unusually sharp/large and some label_0 references emphasize that. That is why two assistants favored label 0. Nevertheless, the model's explanation shows it treated those same early features as typical for label_1 in this instance, and the model's posterior is very strong. Therefore I accept the model's label_1 as the most consistent classification when considering both the logits and the heatmap evidence.\",\n    \"3) Conclusion: The black-box model's classification (label 1) is credible and well-supported by the SHAP heatmap; the sample is not a pure borderline case from the model's perspective, though it remains somewhat ambiguous from an external/human perspective because both labels share very similar morphological features.\"\n  ]\n}"

The model treats the deep negative valley and recovery as the main low-frequency, typical fingerprint for label 1 (strong red in 0Hz rows). \\n  - Label 0 summary also lists early sharp positive transient + deep negative trough + recovery as possible features. However, the documentation for label 0 emphasizes intermediate-frequency spreads and occasional late sharp spikes in some samples; the central discriminative cue in the label-1 description is that the deep valley in the 12\u201336 time window at the lowest-frequency rows is the canonical decisive feature.\\n- The sample strongly matches the label-1 canonical fingerprint: the deep, broad negative trough in t\u22488\u201334 is the strongest red block in the SHAP heatmap (0Hz), followed by the recovery/hump also marked red. These two blocks are exactly the main typical markers highlighted in the label-1 summary. The early spike is present but not the primary SHAP driver. Therefore the sample\u2019s feature pattern best matches label 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final decision:\\n- Reference Sample (Label 1, sample 33): shows near-identical overall morphology (early positive transient, deep trough ~-2.0, smooth recovery to positive hump, late plateau). The current sample\u2019s shape, amplitude ranges, and SHAP low-frequency importance structure closely mirror that reference. \\n- Reference Sample (Label 0, sample 90): also has a superficially similar waveform (early spike and trough), but in the label-0 references the importance patterns and some samples show stronger intermediate-frequency or late sharp spike signatures; our sample\u2019s SHAP emphasizes the mid trough low-frequency block as the strongest cue (the hallmark highlighted for label 1). \\n- Conclusion: the sample matches the label-1 canonical pattern (deep low-frequency trough in the mid-window plus recovery) with high fidelity. The early positive spike is present but is secondary in SHAP importance; intermediate-frequency atypical bits are minimal.\\n\\nSimilarity scoring justification (relative to label 1):\\n- Matched features: early transient (present), deep negative valley (present and strongly typical), recovery to positive hump (present and typical), late plateau (present and weakly typical). More than 80% of the core label-1 features and their typical low-frequency manifestations are satisfied. Hence a high similarity score.\\n\\nFinal result: label 1 with score 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}"

The STFT shows a bright (high-energy) block at low frequencies across the mid time window.\\n  - Limited spread to intermediate frequencies. There is not a broad, persistent high-frequency spread during the main events; higher-frequency components are relatively weak and sparse.\\n\\n- Heatmap (SHAP at time\u00d7frequency):\\n  - Strong red markings (positive SHAP) concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz and adjacent rows) during the mid-time block roughly t\u224815\u201355. This indicates the model regards the low-frequency energy in the deep trough + recovery window as a typical, supportive feature.\\n  - The early positive transient (t\u22480\u20138) also shows light-to-moderate red at the lowest-frequency rows (typical), but the maximal red intensity is located in the trough/recovery block.\\n  - Intermediate-frequency rows show weakly negative or near-neutral (light-blue or near-zero) markings in some transition windows (small ambiguous/atypical contributions), but nothing dominant. The late-stage small bump (t\u224890\u201395) shows negligible SHAP contribution (near neutral / slight blue in a few cells).\\n\\n- Decision about typical/atypical per region:\\n  - Early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20136): low-frequency cells = light-red \u2192 typical (but not the dominant typical block).\\n  - Deep negative valley (t\u22486\u201334): very strong low-frequency red \u2192 typical (primary canonical feature).\\n  - Mid recovery / sustained positive hump (t\u224836\u201360): low-frequency red \u2192 typical.\\n  - Intermediate-frequency spread/jitter during transitions: light-blue / mixed \u2192 atypical or ambiguous (model is cautious about any higher-frequency jitter).\\n  - Late small bump (t\u224890\u201395): near-neutral / slight-blue \u2192 not a typical supporting feature.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern summary of Sample 62:\\n- Pattern: Early large positive spike \u2192 prolonged deep, low-frequency-dominated negative trough \u2192 smooth recovery that crosses baseline into a sustained mid positive hump \u2192 gradual decay to baseline with small late fluctuation. The model's heatmap marks the deep trough and the recovery (low-frequency rows) as strongly typical (red). Intermediate-frequency components are weak and marked ambiguous/atypical (blue or neutral) where present. The late small positive bump is not strongly supported by the heatmap.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching sample pattern to label feature lists:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 descriptions contain the canonical sequence: early positive transient, deep negative valley (dominant low-frequency energy), and a mid recovery/hump. Both labels treat the deep valley + low-frequency recovery as the main typical signature (red in low-frequency rows).\\n- Distinguishing points from the provided label summaries:\\n  - Label_0 often includes an early sharp positive transient and sometimes a pronounced late secondary positive peak (in some samples this late spike is substantial). Label_0's typical markings similarly show low-frequency red for early spike + trough + recovery, but label_0 descriptions emphasize that abrupt late spikes when present may be typical for some label_0 samples.\\n  - Label_1 describes a canonical valley\u2192recovery\u2192late small plateau; late-stage small amplitude plateau (and occasional late spike in some samples) is typical for label_1. Label_1's core canonical feature is the strong low-frequency deep valle y (t\u224812\u201336) and recovery.\\n- Which label fits Sample 62 better?\\n  - Sample 62 has the canonical deep trough + recovery dominated by low-frequency energy \u2014 this is equally important for both labels.\\n  - The early spike in Sample 62 is large (\u2248+3.0), which is compatible with both label descriptions (both include early positive transients in some samples).\\n  - Critically, Sample 62 does NOT show a pronounced late high-amplitude secondary spike (the late bump is small). The late stage is a gradual return to baseline and a small late bump only. That behavior (mid recovery to a low-amplitude late plateau and small late fluctuations) matches the label_1 description more closely than label_0's emphasis on occasional pronounced late spikes.\\n  - The heatmap emphasis: SHAP strong red is concentrated on the long low-frequency trough/recovery block \u2014 exactly the canonical label_1 marker described as the model's main cue for label_1 in the reference documentation. Intermediate-frequency components are minimal/ambiguous (blue), again consistent with label_1 samples where the core low-frequency valley drives classification and jitter is treated as atypical.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision:\\n- Reference sample for label_0 (Sample 35): shows early positive transient \u2192 large negative trough \u2192 recovery hump \u2192 and small late increases. This is visually similar to Sample 62; however label_0 reference samples sometimes exhibit different late-event behavior (some label_0 examples have large late spikes). The SHAP pattern of Sample 62 (strong low-frequency red centered on the trough/recovery) is shared by both label_0 and label_1 references.\\n- Reference sample for label_1 (Sample 22): also shows early positive spike + deep trough + recovery to mid plateau and then small late fluctuations in multiple label_1 examples. The late portion in Sample 62 (no large late spike) aligns well with the majority of label_1 examples described (valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 late small plateau). The heatmap emphasis on the trough/recovery low-frequency block is exactly the canonical strong cue used by the model for label_1 according to the summary.\\n\\nConclusion and scoring rationale:\\n- Because Sample 62's dominant discriminative signature is a pronounced low-frequency deep valley and smooth recovery (with only a small late bump rather than a large late spike), and because the heatmap strongly marks the trough/recovery low-frequency region as typical, the pattern is more consistent with the canonical label_1 description (valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 late small plateau). The early large positive spike is not decisive (both labels can show it), and intermediate-frequency jitter is minimal (also matching label_1 expectation that low-frequency valley dominates). Therefore the final classification is label 1.\\n- Similarity score = 3 (Moderate similarity). Rationale for the numeric score: Sample 62 matches multiple (\u22653) central features of label_1 \u2014 early positive transient, long deep low-frequency valley, and smooth recovery to a mid positive plateau \u2014 and the model's heatmap strongly supports those low-frequency features. However, absolute certainty is reduced because label_0 contains very similar patterns in several reference samples; hence I assign Moderate similarity rather than High (4).\"\n    ]\n}",

This aligns with the large, slow deviations (trough and recovery hump).\\n  - The early sharp positive spike produces energy mainly in low frequencies too (because the plotting and STFT resolution here concentrate large deviations in the lowest rows); intermediate frequency rows show only moderate energy during transitions, not a broad high-frequency footprint (i.e., the signal is dominated by low-frequency, smooth components).\\n  - Overall there is only modest intermediate-frequency spread (some small energy in adjacent rows) \u2014 not a broad high-frequency jitter signature.\\n- SHAP Heatmap (model contribution / typical vs atypical):\\n  - The low-frequency rows (0 Hz and immediately-adjacent low-frequency rows) are strongly red in the time region covering the broad negative trough (\u2248 t 12\u201336) and also red during the ramp/recovery (\u2248 t 34\u201360) \u2014 indicating the model treats these low-frequency trough + recovery features as typical for the assigned label.\\n  - The very early time window (t \u2248 0\u20136) at low frequencies shows mild-to-moderate red as well (the early positive transient has positive SHAP contributions in low-frequency rows) \u2014 i.e., the early spike is also considered typical (or at least supportive) by the model.\\n  - Intermediate-frequency rows (roughly the mid-frequency band) show small patches of light-blue/near-zero during some transition windows (indicating the model regards these higher-frequency components as less-typical/ambiguous). There is no large contiguous blue block overriding the low-frequency red signals.\\n- Classification of each identified feature using the heatmap colors:\\n  - Early sharp positive transient (t\u22481\u20134): marked mildly red in low-frequency rows \u2192 typical.\\n  - Broad deep negative trough (t\u22488\u201334): strongly red in lowest-frequency rows \u2192 strongly typical.\\n  - Mid recovery / positive hump (t\u224834\u201360): red in lowest-frequency rows \u2192 typical.\\n  - Late low-amplitude plateau and small oscillations (t\u224860\u201395): mostly neutral to slight-red in low-frequency rows, some light-blue in intermediate rows \u2192 weakly typical overall, with any small high-frequency jitter treated as ambiguous/atypical.\\n  - Intermediate-frequency spread during transitions: small blue patches \u2192 atypical/ambiguous (but not dominant).\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern summary of the sample:\\n- The sample's pattern can be summarized as: early very sharp positive transient (short, high amplitude) \u2192 immediate descent into a broad, deep negative trough (long-duration, smooth, large negative excursion) \u2192 steady recovery crossing baseline into a sustained positive hump/plateau (moderate amplitude) \u2192 late gentle decay with low-amplitude fluctuations. The SHAP heatmap marks the large slow events (trough + recovery and also the early spike at low-frequency rows) as red (typical). Small intermediate-frequency jitter during transitions is faintly blue (atypical) but minor.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match against provided label feature summaries and patterns:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 share the canonical sequence: early positive transient \u2192 pronounced low-frequency deep valley \u2192 recovery to a positive hump/plateau \u2192 late-stage plateau or optional late spike. The sample therefore matches the general morphology of both labels in raw shape.\\n- Key differences in the feature summaries that help distinguish the labels:\\n  - Label_0 descriptions emphasize early sharp positive transients (t\u22480\u20138) as a typical element in several reference samples; it also notes that intermediate-frequency jitter during transitions is often regarded as atypical (blue) in the heatmap for label_0 samples.\\n  - Label_1 also lists the deep valley and recovery as the primary canonical features, with the low-frequency trough (\u2248 t12\u201336) being the central typical marker. Label_1 sometimes has a late very large positive spike as typical in some examples.\\n- For the current sample the decisive heatmap cues are: (a) strong red at the 0Hz/lowest-frequency rows during the deep trough and recovery (a pattern both labels share), and (b) a clear red marking for the early sharp positive transient in the low-frequency rows (the early transient here is large and the heatmap treats it as typical). Additionally, the intermediate-frequency components during transitions are small and flagged blue/ambiguous (this mirrors the 'intermediate-frequency spread is atypical' note for label_0 samples).\\n- Comparing to the two reference samples provided:\\n  - Reference Sample 1 (label 0): shows the very similar sequence: early strong positive spike, deep broad negative trough, steady recovery to a hump, with the STFT and SHAP emphasizing low-frequency energy in the trough/recovery. The shape and relative timing/amplitudes of sample 62 are highly similar to this label-0 example.\\n  - Reference Sample 2 (label 1): also has a similar valley\u2192recovery morphology; the difference is subtle and lies in how the model\u2019s SHAP marks certain transition bands (and in some label-1 examples the late-stage spike is more prominent). Sample 62 does not show a distinctive late very large spike like some label-1 examples.\\n- Conclusion of Step 3: although both labels share major components, the combination of a very prominent early sharp positive transient that is itself treated as typical by the model (low-frequency red) together with the strong low-frequency red marking of the broad trough/recovery and only small intermediate-frequency atypical patches aligns most closely with the typical pattern described for label 0 (the label_0 summaries explicitly list the early sharp positive transient + broad trough + mid recovery hump sequence and describe intermediate-frequency jitter as frequently atypical). The overall timing and SHAP emphasis are more concordant with the provided label_0 reference patterns than with the distinguishing cases of label_1 (which sometimes emphasize other late-stage signatures).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Verification and final decision with similarity scoring and sanity checks:\\n- Similarity check to label_0: high. The main features (early sharp positive transient, broad deep trough centered in the early-to-mid window, steady recovery hump) are present and each is marked as typical (red) in the low-frequency rows. The minor intermediate-frequency blue patches match the label_0 description that jitter/transition-frequency spread is often atypical. Compared with the provided label_0 reference sample, sample 62 is visually and in time-frequency/SHAP-space highly similar. Score: 4 (high similarity).\\n- Similarity check to label_1: moderate-to-high. The central deep trough + recovery hump (low-frequency red) matches label_1\u2019s canonical features well. However, label_1\u2019s distinguishing examples often include either a smaller early bump or occasionally a pronounced late spike; here the early spike is unusually large and is explicitly marked as typical by the heatmap \u2014 this more strongly aligns with label_0\u2019s documented typical examples. Also, the presence of the intermediate-frequency blue patches (atypical) during transitions is described as more typical behavior in label_0 analyses. Score if measured against label_1 would be 3 (moderate similarity), but since we provide a single score it reflects the chosen label (label_0).\\n\\nFinal classification decision: label 0. Rationale summary: The sample shows the full label_0 canonical sequence (large early positive transient + broad deep low-frequency trough + smooth recovery hump), and the SHAP heatmap marks those low-frequency components as typical (red). Small intermediate-frequency jitter is flagged atypical (blue) which matches the label_0 description that such jitter is not typical. Comparison with the two provided references shows closer alignment to the label-0 reference in both morphology and the SHAP/time-frequency emphasis. Therefore the sample is classified as label 0 with high similarity (score = 4).\"\n  ]\n}"

Softmax on these logits yields a near-certain probability for label 1 (\u22480.99+). The model is numerically highly confident in label 1.\\n- Heatmap corroboration: the model's SHAP heatmap places its strongest positive contributions (red) exactly on the mid-time very-low-frequency block that corresponds to the deep trough and recovery \u2014 the same pattern described in the label summaries as the canonical, highly discriminative signature for label 1. The early spike also has red support. Blue regions are limited to small intermediate-frequency rows during transitions and do not dominate the main discriminative block.\\n- Conclusion about confidence and boundary status: because (a) logits strongly favor label 1, and (b) the heatmap shows dominant red on the core low-frequency trough\u2192recovery region (typical features for label 1), the black-box model's prediction of label 1 is credible and confident. This is not a border-line decision from the model's perspective. Minor intermediate-frequency blue patches indicate small ambiguous components but do not undermine the main evidence.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison with label feature summaries and other assistants:\\n- Both label summaries include sequences of early positive transient \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery hump, so raw morphology alone is not uniquely discriminative.\\n- The key distinguishing cue here is the heatmap's strong low-frequency red concentration over the trough and recovery. The provided label_1 summaries and reference examples repeatedly highlight that the model treats a strong low-frequency trough + recovery as the canonical marker for label 1; the sample's SHAP pattern matches that fingerprint closely.\\n- Three assistants: two independently concluded label 1 (moderate-to-high similarity) and one concluded label 0 (high similarity). Given the model's very large logit margin and the heatmap's dominant red on exactly the canonical low-frequency trough\u2192recovery region associated with label 1, the balance of evidence supports label 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final verification and decision:\\n- Potential ambiguity: label 0 examples can sometimes share the same morphological stages (and one assistant argued that), and small intermediate-frequency blue patches reflect that some transition components could be ambiguous. However, these are secondary; the strongest and most model-important features (very-low-frequency energy in the trough/recovery block and supporting early spike) are marked red and align with label 1's canonical signature.\\n- Final classification: label 1. The black-box model's label 1 prediction is both numerically confident (large logit gap) and qualitatively supported by the heatmap (dominant typical features), so the model's result is credible.\\n\\nSummary statement:\\n- Final result chosen: label 1 (normal heartbeat). The black-box model also predicted label 1 with high confidence. The SHAP heatmap indicates the sample's principal events (broad trough and recovery in the very-low-frequency rows, plus the early spike) are treated as typical features by the model, validating its confident prediction. Minor intermediate-frequency atypical patches exist but do not overturn the dominant signal.\"\n    ]\n}"

This is a distinct early spike. Heatmap/STFT mapping: low-frequency energy present but not as dominant as the trough region.\\n  - Early\u2013mid stage (t \u2248 8\u201334): a long, smooth descent into a pronounced deep negative valley/trough reaching approximately -2.0 to -2.3 around t\u224830\u201334. The trough is broad and smooth (low volatility) and lasts many time steps.\\n  - Mid stage (t \u2248 34\u201350): a clear and reasonably rapid recovery from the trough crossing y=0 and producing a sustained positive hump/plateau with amplitudes roughly 0.8\u20131.0 around t\u224842\u201350.\\n  - Late stage (t \u2248 50\u201395): a sustained mild positive plateau with modest fluctuations and some smaller local peaks around t\u224870\u201380, then gradual return close to baseline with small jitters at the very end.\\n- Time-frequency image (STFT):\\n  - The highest signal energy is concentrated in the very-low-frequency rows (the 0 Hz row and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows) during the deep trough time-window (roughly t\u224812\u201336). This indicates the trough and the subsequent slow recovery are dominated by low-frequency content (smooth large deviations).\\n  - Lower but noticeable low-frequency energy also during the mid recovery (t\u224834\u201355) and some energy during the early spike (t\u22480\u20136). There is little broad high-frequency content; the energy is mostly concentrated in the low-frequency band with only small spread to intermediate frequencies during transitions.\\n- SHAP heatmap (feature contribution):\\n  - Very strong red (high positive SHAP) concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz and adjacent low-freq rows) in the time block corresponding to the deep negative trough (approximately t\u224812\u201336). This indicates the model treats the deep, low-frequency trough as a strongly typical feature for whatever class the model predicted for this sample.\\n  - Mild-to-moderate red in lowest-frequency rows during the mid recovery and sustained positive hump region (t\u224834\u201355), indicating the recovery/hump is also a typical feature.\\n  - Some red in low-frequency rows around the early time region (t\u22480\u20136), but weaker than the trough-region red; the early large spike has modest positive SHAP at low frequencies (so it is considered somewhat typical but less dominant than the trough).\\n  - A small patch of blue (slight negative SHAP) appears in an intermediate-frequency band around the later-stage local fluctuations (roughly t\u224870\u201380 at mid frequencies), indicating intermediate-frequency jitter in that late window is considered somewhat atypical by the model.\\n- Determination of feature-typicality (by region):\\n  - Early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20134): presence confirmed in line plot and low-frequency energy in STFT; SHAP shows small-to-moderate red at very-low-frequency rows in the early window \u2014 classified as a typical (supportive) feature but weaker than trough-region red.\\n  - Deep negative valley (t\u22488\u201334): strong, broad trough with concentrated low-frequency STFT energy and strong red in SHAP at the 0Hz/adjacent rows \u2014 classified as a strongly typical feature.\\n  - Mid recovery / sustained positive hump (t\u224834\u201355): clear recovery with low-frequency energy and red SHAP coloring \u2014 classified as typical.\\n  - Late-stage small peaks/plateau (t\u224855\u201395): low-amplitude positive plateau with small jitters; low-frequency contributions are neutral-to-light-red (weakly typical) while a small intermediate-frequency blue patch indicates some atypical jitter \u2014 classify the slow plateau as weakly typical and the higher-frequency jitter during this period as mildly atypical.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Summarize the sample's feature pattern and typicality map:\\n- Pattern sequence observed: early very-sharp positive spike (t\u22480\u20134, moderately typical) \u2192 prolonged deep smooth negative trough (t\u22488\u201334, strongly typical) \u2192 recovery to sustained positive hump (t\u224834\u201355, typical) \u2192 long low-amplitude positive plateau with small late jitters (t\u224855\u201395, weakly typical; some intermediate-frequency jitter in late window flagged slightly atypical).\\n- Frequency-wise: energy and SHAP importance are concentrated in the very-low-frequency rows for the trough and recovery (these regions are strongly red), indicating the model considers low-frequency large deviations (the trough and smooth recovery) to be the most diagnostic and typical features in this sample. Intermediate-frequency spread is minimal except for a small late-stage atypical blue patch.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match against label feature lists and decide label:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 feature summaries contain a very similar canonical morphology: early positive transient \u2192 deep low-frequency valley \u2192 mid recovery positive hump \u2192 late plateau/optional late spike. The sample's waveform matches that canonical sequence closely.\\n- Key discriminant(s):\\n  - The model's strongest SHAP red signal in this sample is the deep negative trough at low-frequency rows (t\u224812\u201336). In the provided label summaries, label_1 explicitly emphasizes that the deep low-frequency valley (t\u224812\u201336) is the primary canonical feature and is the main typical signature (strong red) used to identify label_1 samples.\\n  - Label_0 also lists the same sequence, but its exemplar samples often emphasize an early sharp positive transient as a prominent typical feature and sometimes show stronger late large spikes in some label_0 samples. In this test sample the early spike is large but the SHAP red for the early window is smaller relative to the trough-region red; there is no extremely large late spike (t>85) that some reference patterns associate with label_0.\\n- Comparing to reference samples:\\n  - Reference Sample 35 (Label 0): sequence is similar (early positive \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery hump \u2192 late plateau). The shapes are similar; however the early positive transient in the reference label-0 example is smaller than the early spike in the test sample and the label-0 examples often have the early transient as a strongly-typical region in SHAP across many label-0 references.\\n  - Reference Sample 22 (Label 1): shows a very large early spike (~3.9) and a deep trough/recovery pattern; this is highly similar in amplitude and shape to the test sample. The label-1 reference also features strong low-frequency SHAP around the trough region, just as in the test sample.\\n- Conclusion from pattern matching: the test sample's most diagnostic and strongly-typical model signal is the deep low-frequency trough (t\u224812\u201336) and the subsequent smooth recovery \u2014 precisely the core canonical fingerprint emphasized for label 1 in the provided label summaries. In addition, the test sample\u2019s combination (very large early spike but with the model focusing most strongly on the trough) aligns very closely with Label 1 reference patterns (e.g., Sample 22). The late stage shows only weakly typical behavior with minor atypical jitter, which exists in both label summaries as ambiguous.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final verification and similarity scoring:\\n- Considering all features and the SHAP typicality coloring, the sample matches label_1 slightly better than label_0 because:\\n  1) the single strongest SHAP red region corresponds to the deep low-frequency trough (the principal canonical indicator for label 1 in the feature summary),\\n  2) the magnitude and shape of the early spike and the trough/recovery closely mirror the label_1 reference sample (Sample 22), and\\n  3) there is no strong late abnormal late spike that would push the sample toward a label_0-specific exemplar pattern.\\n- Similarity quantification (comparative):\\n  - Similarity to label 1: 4 (High similarity). Rationale: the test sample contains the main label_1 features (early positive bump/spike, pronounced low-frequency deep trough around t\u224812\u201336, and a smooth recovery hump) and the SHAP heatmap shows the trough & recovery as strongly typical (red). These match \u226580% of the canonical label_1 descriptors and match the label_1 reference sample closely.\\n  - Similarity to label 0: 3 (Moderate similarity). Rationale: the overall morphological sequence is also consistent with label_0 patterns, but the relative SHAP emphasis (deep trough being the strongest region, and lack of a stronger SHAP early-spike emphasis or very-late large spike) better matches label_1. Thus there is a high degree of overlap but not as complete a match as for label_1.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1 with a high similarity score (4).\"\n  ]\n}",

The primary discriminant in the provided documentation is whether the model\u2019s high-impact features (low-frequency trough and recovery) are treated as typical for label 1 vs. label 0 and whether there is substantial intermediate-frequency jitter or atypical mixed coloring.\\n- In this sample the heatmap\u2019s dominant red low-frequency blocks at the trough and recovery match the canonical label-1 fingerprint described in the dataset summary. Label-0 examples in the reference often show more intermediate-frequency spread or mixed blue/red during transitions; here intermediate-frequency energy is minimal.\\n- Three assistants\u2019 votes: one labeled label 0 and two labeled label 1. The black-box model also predicted label 1 with high confidence. Considering the majority of independent analyses and the model\u2019s own high-confidence SHAP-supported reasoning, label 1 is the most consistent choice.\\n- Potential counterpoint: because both classes share similar tri-phasic morphology, a misclassification risk exists in general.

The black-box logits show a very large margin favoring label 1, consistent with the SHAP explanation. Minor blue/ambiguous patches at intermediate frequencies are small and do not overcome the dominant typical evidence.

Interpretation: the model regards the exact 0Hz component of the early spike as atypical (blue), while surrounding low-frequency content is ambiguous/weakly supportive \u2014 overall the early spike is ambiguous/partly-atypical for the model. \\n  - Trough window (t\u22488\u201334): lowest-frequency rows show strong red (positive SHAP). Interpretation: the broad deep negative valley's low-frequency energy is a strongly typical feature for the predicted label (the model treats this as decisive/typical). \\n  - Mid recovery (t\u224834\u201350): lowest-frequency rows show red/light-red. Interpretation: the recovery hump is treated as a typical/supportive feature. \\n  - Late block (t\u224860\u201385): low-frequency rows show light-red contributions corresponding to the small bump/plateau (weakly typical/supportive). \\n  - Intermediate-frequency rows: sparse small blue patches around transition times (minor atypical/ambiguous contributions). \\n- Conclusion Step 1 (typicality summary):\\n  - Typical features (model-supported): the broad deep trough (t\u22488\u201334) and the mid recovery hump (t\u224834\u201350) \u2014 both with strong red in the lowest-frequency rows.

The only notable deviation is the early spike\u2019s 0Hz cell being blue; however the model's strongest evidence (trough+recovery) is highly typical and strongly red. \\n- Conclusion Step 2: The model\u2019s high logit/probability is consistent with the heatmap: decisive, typical low-frequency trough + recovery dominate the SHAP map and support label 1. This is not a marginal/borderline classification \u2014 the sample appears a typical example for the model\u2019s label 1 decision despite a localized atypical early 0Hz cell.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Cross-check against label summaries and the three assistants' analyses to pick the most reasonable classification:\\n- Provided label summaries: both labels share the morphological sequence (early positive transient \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery hump \u2192 late plateau/spike). The discriminant described in the documentation is how the heatmap marks the early spike vs trough: label_0 often has the early spike marked typical (red at 0Hz), while label_1 emphasizes the deep valley (0Hz & adjacent low-frequency red) as the canonical marker and allows occasional early 0Hz anomalies (blue) in some samples. \\n- The sample\u2019s SHAP pattern (strong red concentrated on the trough & recovery low-frequency rows and an early 0Hz blue cell) matches the documented label_1 fingerprint very well \u2014 the model is treating the trough+recovery as the decisive typical features and down-weighting the early 0Hz spike component. \\n- Three other assistants independently classified the sample as label 1 with high similarity (score 4) and gave nearly identical rationales: they highlight the strong low-frequency trough+recovery as decisive and the early spike\u2019s absolute-0Hz blue as a point that reduces label_0 support. \\n- Combined judgment: both data-level evidence (STFT + heatmap) and multiple independent human analyses align with label 1; the black-box model\u2019s high probability is consistent and justified by the heatmap\u2019s red regions. \\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final verification, caveats, and final decision:\\n- Verify no overlooked pattern: intermediate/high-frequency jitter is minimal \u2014 therefore no contrary high-frequency signature indicates label confusion. The only caveat (early 0Hz blue) is already present in label_1 examples in the documentation, so it does not contradict label_1. \\n- Risk of misclassification: low. The dominant, model-typical features are strongly marked red and correspond to label_1 canonical markers; hence the sample is not a boundary case for the black-box model. \\n\\nFinal conclusion: The black-box model's classification (label 1) is credible and well-supported. The logits indicate very high confidence (~99.9% probability for label 1), and the SHAP heatmap shows dominant red in the trough and recovery low-frequency rows \u2014 the exact features the model treats as typical of label 1. Independent assistant analyses also agree. Therefore the most reasonable final classification is label 1 (normal heartbeat).\"]\n}"

All three phases are represented and the model's SHAP heatmap signals are principally red in the low-frequency bins for the major events, indicating consistent support (typical evidence) for one class across the sequence rather than conflicting typical/atypical signals.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison with provided misclassification pattern lists and conclusion:\n- Label_1 boundary pattern (true label 0 samples misclassified as 1) is characterized (in the summary) by an early deep negative baseline (time ~0\u201320) that is marked blue (atypical for label-0) and which dominates the SHAP sum so the model tends to predict the other class. Our sample does NOT have an early deep negative baseline; its deep negative event is mid-sequence and in this sample the mid trough is marked red (typical), not blue. Therefore the key early-blue signature that drives the label_1 misclassifications is absent.\n- Label_0 boundary pattern (true label 1 samples misclassified as 0) typically hinges on a mid-phase deep negative valley that the SHAP heatmap marks blue (atypical for label-1), combined with conflicting early/late features. While our waveform morphology (early positive spike + deep mid trough + late plateau) superficially resembles some label_0 examples, the decisive difference is the color: the reference label_0 misclassification cases show the mid trough as blue (atypical) in SHAP, whereas in sample 74 the mid trough is strongly red (typical). In other words, the mid-trough here reinforces the same class as the other events rather than contradicting them.\n- Net judgement: the SHAP map shows consistent red support of the major events (early spike, mid trough, recovery/plateau). There is no dominant blue region that would indicate an atypical feature likely to push the model to the opposite label and produce a boundary/misclassification. Because the typical/atypical coloring is consistent and supportive, this sample is unlikely to be a boundary case that commonly causes misclassification in the patterns provided.\n\nApproximate logits comment (how boundary vs. non-boundary samples typically look):\n- From the provided examples, boundary/misclassified samples often have small net logit margins (near zero), e.g., predicted logit differences (classA - classB) that fall in a narrow band around 0 (roughly -0.5 to +0.5), because contradictory SHAP regions (large blue vs red in different windows) cancel out. Strongly misclassified examples that still favor the wrong class can show larger margins (> +1 or < -1) depending on which atypical region dominates.\n- For sample 74, since SHAP red dominates across key windows, the model would likely output a relatively confident logit for the class it prefers (magnitude likely > ~1), not the near-zero logits associated with boundary confusion. This supports the conclusion that sample 74 is not a prototypical boundary/misclassification case.\n\nConclusion: the sample's feature set and SHAP coloring do not match the blue-dominant atypical signatures described for either misclassification group (label_1 or label_0). The evidence therefore indicates it is not likely to be one of the typical misclassification boundary cases described above.",

Converting to probabilities via softmax gives approx: P(label0) \u2248 0.00079, P(label1) \u2248 0.99921. The model is therefore extremely confident in label 1.\\n- Heatmap consistency: The SHAP heatmap shows red-dominant low-frequency attribution exactly in the trough and recovery windows \u2014 these are the model\u2019s main cues and are marked as typical. This concordance between a very large logit gap and red-dominant SHAP attribution indicates the model is not only confident numerically but is relying on strongly-typical features (not confused or borderline cues).\\n- Boundary vs typical sample assessment: Because (1) the dominant features are strongly red in the decisive trough window, (2) the STFT energy is concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows (consistent with smooth large-amplitude events), and (3) the logits show a huge margin favoring label 1, this sample behaves as a typical (not boundary) example for the model\u2019s predicted label. There are no broad blue or mixed regions that would indicate confusion or ambiguous cross-label similarity.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Combine with label summaries and the three assistants\u2019 classifications:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 summaries contain very similar morphological elements (early positive transient \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery hump), so shape alone is not fully discriminative. The main distinguishing signal in the provided summaries is how the heatmap at the 0Hz/low-frequency band during the trough and late events is interpreted across reference examples.\\n- The SHAP heatmap here places the strongest red exactly at the trough low-frequency block \u2014 the provided label_1 summary emphasizes that a deep low-frequency trough with the 0Hz row strongly red is the primary canonical marker for label_1. Label_0 also can show these elements, but label_0 references often emphasize early sharp transients and sometimes late spikes; our sample lacks a large late spike and the heatmap\u2019s decisive red-block aligns closely with the label_1 canonical description.\\n- The three assistants' results: two independent analyses concluded label 0 (high similarity), one concluded label 1. Weighing: human annotators can interpret similar morphology differently, but the black-box model\u2019s strong logit margin and the SHAP heatmap\u2019s red-dominant attribution on the trough/recovery strongly favor label 1 in the context of the provided label summaries.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Verification and final decision:\\n- Re-check for missed pattern features: there is no pronounced intermediate-frequency spread (no jitter) and no very large late spike (>+3.0) which were traits sometimes associated with label_1 or label_0 in examples; the absence of those ambiguous features reduces cross-label confusion.\\n- Given the model\u2019s very high confidence (softmax \u2248 99.9% for label 1) and the heatmap showing red-dominant, low-frequency contributions in the decisive trough/recovery windows (typical features for label_1 per the summaries), the black-box model\u2019s prediction is credible.\\n\\nFinal conclusion: classify as label 1. The black-box model\u2019s predicted label 1 is well supported by (a) a very large logit/probability margin in favor of label 1, (b) SHAP heatmap showing red-dominant low-frequency attribution on the trough and recovery (typical features), and (c) STFT and line plot morphology consistent with the label_1 canonical fingerprint. Although two assistants favored label 0, the combined evidence (model confidence + attribution alignment to label_1 canonical features) indicates label 1 is the most reasonable final classification.\"\n  ]\n}"

SHAP heatmap: clearly red in the low-to-mid frequency rows during the early peak \u2192 interpreted as a typical/positive contribution (red) in those low-frequency components.\n- Mid stage (t \u2248 20\u201340, strongest around t\u224830\u201338): a broad, deep negative trough down to \u2248 -2.0 to -2.3 (slow, sustained valley with gradual recovery). STFT: very strong DC/near-0Hz energy concentrated in the 0 Hz row at these times. SHAP heatmap: dominant deep blue precisely on the 0 Hz row (and some blue in adjacent lowest rows) over this mid trough \u2192 this is an atypical feature (blue) in the critical 0Hz/DC component.\n- Transition/recovery (t \u2248 42\u201355): a fairly steep, sustained rise from the trough back up to ~0 and beyond; STFT shows frequency spreading into adjacent low-frequency bins. SHAP: mixed but weak; some low-frequency cells are slightly red while adjacent cells are near-zero \u2192 ambiguous to weakly typical.\n- Late stage (t \u2248 55\u201395): a positive elevated plateau and small fluctuations around +0.3 to +1.0 (including small bumps around t\u224880\u201390). STFT: DC/low-frequency energy concentrated near 0 Hz row. SHAP: generally light red or near-zero in low-frequency rows in this late window \u2192 mild typical contribution.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 combined sample pattern:\n- The sequence shows the canonical triad: early large positive transient (typical/red), a pronounced mid-sequence broad negative DC-dominant trough (atypical/deep-blue at 0Hz), and a late positive recovery/plateau (mildly typical/red). The strongest SHAP signal in terms of atypicality is the mid trough's 0Hz/DC component (deep blue). The early and late positive low-frequency components are red but do not appear to overcome the large negative (blue) contribution centered on the 0Hz row during the mid trough.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 mapping to provided misclassification patterns:\n- This exact combination (early transient positive spike + broad mid deep negative trough with dominant 0Hz/DC energy marked blue in SHAP + late positive plateau) is described in the label_0 pattern set (several example IDs share this pattern). The label_0 patterns specifically call out the mid-phase deep negative valley with concentrated 0Hz energy flagged blue as the primary atypical driver that outweighs the early/late typical components and causes the model to predict label_0 incorrectly. Sample 32 matches that description very closely.\n\nConclusion and approximate model-logit behaviour:\n- Because the mid trough produces a strong negative/atypical SHAP contribution (deep blue on the 0Hz row) while early/late red contributions are weaker or shorter in extent, the net SHAP/logit sum is expected to favor the model decision that corresponds to the label_0 misclassification pattern. In practice for similar boundary examples the model often outputs a higher logit for label_0 by a modest-to-moderate margin (typical logit difference in prior boundary cases is on the order of ~1.0 to 3.0 in favor of the mispredicted label). Therefore the sample is highly likely to be one of the typical misclassification cases described under label_0.",

SHAP: generally light red or near-zero in low-frequency rows in this late window \u2192 mild typical contribution.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 combined sample pattern:\\n- The sequence shows the canonical triad: early large positive transient (typical/red), a pronounced mid-sequence broad negative DC-dominant trough (atypical/deep-blue at 0Hz), and a late positive recovery/plateau (mildly typical/red). The strongest SHAP signal in terms of atypicality is the mid trough's 0Hz/DC component (deep blue). The early and late positive low-frequency components are red but do not appear to overcome the large negative (blue) contribution centered on the 0Hz row during the mid trough.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 mapping to provided misclassification patterns:\\n- This exact combination (early transient positive spike + broad mid deep negative trough with dominant 0Hz/DC energy marked blue in SHAP + late positive plateau) is described in the label_0 pattern set (several example IDs share this pattern). The label_0 patterns specifically call out the mid-phase deep negative valley with concentrated 0Hz energy flagged blue as the primary atypical driver that outweighs the early/late typical components and causes the model to predict label_0 incorrectly. Sample 32 matches that description very closely.\\n\\nConclusion and approximate model-logit behaviour:\\n- Because the mid trough produces a strong negative/atypical SHAP contribution (deep blue on the 0Hz row) while early/late red contributions are weaker or shorter in extent, the net SHAP/logit sum is expected to favor the model decision that corresponds to the label_0 misclassification pattern. In practice for similar boundary examples the model often outputs a higher logit for label_0 by a modest-to-moderate margin (typical logit difference in prior boundary cases is on the order of ~1.0 to 3.0 in favor of the mispredicted label). Therefore the sample is highly likely to be one of the typical misclassification cases described under label_0.\"\n    ]\n}",

The three label-0 references show near-identical morphology: early sharp positive transient, broad trough centered slightly after t\u224830\u201340, smooth recovery and late positive plateau; their STFTs likewise show strong low-frequency energy in the same time windows. The test sample's waveform and STFT are visually nearly identical to these label-0 examples (very strong morphological and TF match). This supports high similarity to label 0.\\n- The label-1 similar reference (Sample 40) also shows a closely related morphology. This underlines that this pattern is shared across labels and explains why the sample is a boundary case for the black-box model. However, relative to Sample 40, the test sample's timing and the specific prominence of the early transient and the trough shape align more tightly with the label-0 examples.\\n- Dissimilar references: the dissimilar label-1 (Sample 1) and dissimilar label-0 (Sample 23) differ more in TF distribution and in the timing/morphology of large peaks\u2014these do not match the test sample well, reinforcing the conclusion that the test sample belongs to the cluster represented by the similar label-0 references.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification:\\n- Final classification: label 0.\\n- Score for final label: 4 (high similarity). Rationale: The test sample matches the principal hallmark features of label 0 with a high degree of conformity (>80%): early sharp positive transient, long smooth negative trough, low-frequency-dominant TF energy during the large deviations, smooth mid recovery, and a late positive plateau. Multiple provided label-0 reference samples (three of four similar references) are visually and spectrally very close to the test sample, strengthening the assignment.\\n\\nNotes on boundary/ambiguity: The sample is a borderline case in the sense that the canonical valley\u2192recovery pattern is common to both labels in this dataset; label 1 also shares many of these features and one similar example was labeled 1. This explains why a black-box model might occasionally misclassify the sample.

The trough occupies several time steps and shows low volatility (smooth plateau/valley).\\n\"\n    \"- Phase 4 (recovery, t \u2248 40\u201356): A steady, smooth recovery that crosses y=0 roughly around t\u224850\u201354 and continues upward forming a positive hump.\\n\"\n    \"- Phase 5 (late plateau and small bump, t \u2248 56\u201395): A sustained positive plateau with values ~0.3\u20130.9 and a modest late bump around t\u224876\u201382 (peak \u2248 0.8\u20130.95). Late fluctuations are low-amplitude and not jagged.\\n\\n\"\n    \"B. Time-frequency (STFT) summary\\n\"\n    \"- The STFT heatmap shows the highest energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz and adjacent low-frequency bins) during the major amplitude events: notably in the trough window (roughly the mid time-block) and also visible during the early spike and during portions of the late plateau. The color scale shows a bright/strong low-frequency block centered on the trough time window.\\n\"\n    \"- There is minimal spread into intermediate-frequency rows. Intermediate and higher frequencies show faint or near-background magnitudes \u2014 there is no broad frequency-band footprint indicative of strong jitter. Small intermediate-frequency energy patches are weak compared with the dominant low-frequency band.\\n\\n\"\n    \"C. Volatility and spectral implications\\n\"\n    \"- The signal is dominated by slow, large-amplitude components (low-frequency content). Transitions are smooth; jitter is minor. The combination of a sharp-looking early peak (short duration but still low-frequency dominant) plus a broad deep trough and smooth recovery is the key morphological signature.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Identify features that could cause boundary behavior / misclassification (which features are shared with the other label and which are distinctive)\\n\\n\"\n    \"- Shared features (potential causes of confusion): Both label_0 and label_1 canonical descriptions include a sequence of early positive transient \u2192 deep negative trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 late plateau/spike. The deep low-frequency trough and mid recovery are the strongest shared elements. Thus the presence of a broad deep trough plus recovery is not discriminative alone and is the primary reason this sample is a boundary case.\\n\"\n    \"- Distinctive features favoring label_0: The early positive transient in this sample is relatively large and sharp compared to the 'early small positive transient' described as typical for label_1 examples. The dataset's label_0 descriptions explicitly call out an 'early sharp positive transient' followed by the deep trough as a canonical fingerprint; that matches this sample closely.\\n\"\n    \"- Features that might mislead or should not be over-weighted: Late spikes or intermediate-frequency jitter are important discriminators in the reference sets (e.g., some label_1 examples have notable late spikes). This sample does not show a very large late spike or substantial intermediate-frequency energy; therefore any classification leaning heavily on a late spike signature (label_1) would be inappropriate here. Similarly, because deep trough + recovery is shared, relying only on the trough as the decisive feature would risk misclassification.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching sample features to label summaries while avoiding overreliance on shared, ambiguous features\\n\\n\"\n    \"- Match to label_0 summary: The sample has the label_0 hallmarks \u2014 a pronounced early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20138), an early-to-mid broad deep negative trough (t\u224820\u201340) with dominant low-frequency energy, a smooth mid recovery (crosses baseline ~t\u224850\u201354), and a late positive plateau/hump. The STFT localization (strong energy in the lowest-frequency rows during key events and little intermediate-frequency spread) matches the label_0 typical frequency signature.\\n\"\n    \"- Match to label_1 summary: The sample also meets many label_1 listed elements (deep valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 plateau). Label_1 reference examples often center decision on the deep trough's low-frequency energy, which this sample has. Because that deep-trough signature is the most emphatic shared feature across both labels, the sample naturally looks similar to label_1 in that narrow sense.\\n\"\n    \"- Verdict from feature matching but avoiding ambiguous basis: Given both labels share the core trough\u2192recovery morphology, we should avoid using the trough alone as a decisive feature. Instead, include the early large/sharp positive transient and the spectral concentration (low-frequency dominance across the sequence) \u2014 these combined points align more strongly with label_0 in the provided label summaries. The relative sharpness and amplitude of the early spike (and its presence with otherwise low jitter) is a discriminative cue in favor of label_0.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Consider the black-box model and other assistants' analyses and reconcile final label choice\\n\\n\"\n    \"- Other assistants: Three independent assistant analyses (Rounds 1\u20133) all conclude label 0 with high similarity scores (4) and note the sample is a boundary case because label_1 shares the valley\u2192recovery morphology. Their detailed feature extractions match mine in timing, amplitudes and STFT observations. They emphasize the early sharp positive transient and the concentrated low-frequency trough as primary reasons for label_0.\\n\"\n    \"- Black-box model: Predicted label 0. Logits are [0.11431688070297241, -1.5880978107452393], indicating the model prefers label 0 (positive logit for class 0) with a comfortable margin. The model's training accuracies (label 0: 0.9167, label 1: 0.8906) are both high, indicating generally reliable discrimination; the predicted label 0 aligns with the spectral + morphological cues highlighted.\\n\"\n    \"- Potential misclassification concerns: Because the labels share the trough\u2192recovery building blocks, a classifier that weighted only the trough or late plateau might be uncertain. However, neither the black-box model nor the assistants flagged strong intermediate-frequency energy or an atypical late spike as present here (which would point to label_1 in certain examples). The consistent agreement (assistants + model) and the characteristic early sharp transient tip the balance toward label_0.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Step 5 \u2014 Final decision, alternative, and verification\\n\\n\"\n    \"- Final classification: label 0. Justification succinctly restated: The sample shows an early, relatively large and sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20138) followed by a broad, deep, low-frequency-dominant negative trough (t\u224820\u201340) and a smooth low-frequency recovery crossing baseline (~t\u224850\u201354) into a sustained positive plateau. This combination (particularly the prominent early transient together with trough + concentrated low-frequency STFT energy) matches label_0's canonical fingerprint more closely than label_1 once the shared trough feature is not used in isolation.\\n\"\n    \"- Alternative plausible classification: label 1 (borderline). Rationale: Because label_1 reference patterns also prominently include a deep low-frequency trough and recovery, and because this trough is the dominant energy event, a model that weighted the trough alone could reasonably predict label_1. Thus label_1 is a plausible alternative, but less supported once the early sharp transient and overall spectral signature are considered.\\n\"\n    \"- Verification and consistency checks: I rechecked timing, amplitude ranges, and STFT band concentrations to ensure no major intermediate-frequency spread (would have undermined the label_0 assignment). No strong late abrupt spike or post-spike rapid rebound (features that sometimes favor label_1) is present. The conclusion (label 0) is consistent with three independent assistant analyses and the black-box model output, and it relies on features that are discriminative in the provided label summaries rather than on the shared trough alone.\\n\\n\"\n    \"Concise outcome: final = label 0 (most consistent with the full set of morphological and time-frequency features); alternative = label 1 (plausible because of the shared deep trough\u2192recovery morphology but less supported when the early sharp transient and spectral concentration are included).\"\n  ]\n}"

    "round3_rationale": "Step 1 \u2014 Feature extraction:\n- Line plot: three clear phases: (A) early transient (t\u22480) mildly positive (~+1.0) followed immediately by a pronounced deep negative baseline/trough from about t\u22484\u201316 with amplitude down to \u2248 -2.8 to -3.0; (B) a relatively fast recovery and mid positive plateau/rounded peak around t\u224822\u201330 with values \u2248 +0.6 to +1.1, then slow decay to near-zero with small jitter from \u224835\u201380; (C) a very late, sharp large positive spike at \u2248t90 peaking >+3.0 then abrupt return toward 0. Morphology: early trough is broad and sustained (low-frequency/near-DC), mid peak/plateau is slower (low-frequency DC-like), late spike is short-duration transient.\n- STFT/time\u2013frequency: very strong energy concentrated in the lowest frequency row (0 Hz / near-DC) during the early trough (t\u22480\u201316). The mid recovery/plateau (t\u224820\u201340) also shows concentrated low-frequency energy (but with less magnitude than the early trough). The late spike (t\u224886\u201392) appears as a short-duration low-frequency energy burst. Little high-frequency spread \u2014 frequency energy is dominated by 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows (some modest vertical spread during the slope/recovery).\n- SHAP heatmap: the dominant SHAP signal is a strong red block at the lowest frequency rows centered around roughly t\u224820\u201340 (mid recovery/plateau) indicating those low-frequency components are strongly driving the model toward the class the heatmap marks as \u201ctypical\u201d (i.e., the target class in the heatmap). The early deep trough (t\u22480\u201316) shows only weak/near-neutral to mildly colored SHAP (no large blue dominance visible), and the very-late spike shows only weak SHAP influence (slightly mixed; small blue-ish patching in some adjacent freq rows near the late region). \n- Judgment per region: mid-phase low-frequency (0Hz row, t\u224820\u201340) = strongly TYPICAL (red). Early broad trough (0\u201316) = present and large in the signal energy, but SHAP does not show a strong blue signal for that region here (so in this sample it is either NEUTRAL-to-WEAK; not strongly flagged atypical). Late spike (t\u224886\u201392) = short-duration, low SHAP impact (AMBIGUOUS/weak). Overall the model\u2019s SHAP emphasizes the mid-phase low-frequency energy as the main typical evidence.\n\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern summary for this sample:\n- Pattern = Early deep negative DC-like trough (broad, large amplitude trough around t\u22484\u201316, value \u2248 -2.8) + fast rise into a mid positive plateau (t\u224820\u201340, values \u2248 +0.6\u20131.1) + prolonged near-zero/low-amplitude section with small jitter (t\u224840\u201380) + late abrupt positive transient spike (t\u224886\u201392, >+3.0). Heatmap mapping: mid-phase low-frequency cells (0Hz row) are strongly red (typical); early trough, while energetically dominant in STFT, is not strongly blue in the SHAP map for this sample (so it does not receive a large atypical penalty here); late spike has weak/ambiguous SHAP contribution.\n\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to known misclassification patterns and likely outcome:\n- The overall morphology (early deep negative baseline + mid positive plateau + late spike) matches the canonical pattern described under the provided \"label_1\" misclassification set (examples: Samples 12, 54, 58): those examples share a pronounced early low-frequency trough followed by mid/late low-frequency positive plateaus/spikes. In the documented failure mode, a strongly atypical early trough (blue in SHAP at low frequencies) often dominates and pushes logits toward the opposite class. In our sample the early trough is present and energetically dominant in the STFT (so it is the same structural feature), and the mid-phase low-frequency energy is strongly marked as typical (red) by SHAP \u2014 the same competing pattern (atypical early trough vs. typical mid-plateau) that creates boundary confusion.\n- Therefore this sample falls into the same boundary / misclassification family described under \"label 1\" (i.e., the model commonly ends up predicting label 1 for such patterns). Because the mid-phase low-frequency evidence is strongly red and the early trough is present (even if not strongly blue in this particular SHAP map), the sample is highly likely to be a boundary case that the black-box will classify as the label_1 pattern (high risk of being predicted as label 1). \n\nApproximate logits / probabilities (interpretive): for samples of this family the model typically sums competing SHAP contributions and often favors label 1 with a moderate positive margin. A reasonable expected outcome for this sample is a probability for label 1 in the high range (e.g., ~0.75\u20130.95) corresponding to a positive logit margin on the order of \u2248 +1.0 to +3.0 in favor of label 1. The exact margin depends on how strongly the model weights the early trough as atypical; because here the SHAP map does not show a very strong blue penalty early, the net margin is likely at the upper end of that range (i.e., the classifier will produce a confident label 1 prediction).\n\nConclusion: pattern and energy distribution closely match the documented label_1 misclassification family (early trough + mid plateau + late spike). Hence the sample is highly likely to be a typical misclassification instance mapped to label 1.",

Later windows (mid-to-late) show only weak low-frequency energy and the late spike is less pronounced in the STFT warm colors than the earlier events (i.e., the strongest TF energy is associated with the deep trough \u2192 recovery interval).\\n\\n- SHAP heatmap (contribution to classification): The dominant red region (strong positive SHAP contributions) is spatially concentrated in the very-low-frequency rows (0 Hz and the first adjacent low-frequency rows) and is located around the mid-time window corresponding to the recovery / positive hump (approximately time steps \u224820\u201335). The early-to-mid trough time (\u22488\u201315) is not strongly red in the SHAP map (it is mostly neutral / faint), and the late spike (~92\u201394) shows little to no strong red marking in the heatmap.

Classification-wise: ambiguous-to-weakly-typical.\\n  - Deep negative trough (t\u22488\u201315): although the STFT shows strong low-frequency energy here, the SHAP map does not mark this region strongly red. So the model is not treating the trough's low-frequency component in this exact time bin as the main typical signature \u2014 this makes the trough's contribution ambiguous or slightly atypical in the model's view (i.e., not the primary typical cue in this sample).\\n  - Mid recovery / sustained positive hump (t\u224820\u201334): strongly marked red in the 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows in the SHAP heatmap \u2192 classified by the model as a clear typical feature (high positive contribution).\\n  - Late-stage baseline / small jitters (t\u224834\u201385): low energy and near-neutral SHAP markings \u2192 weakly-typical or neutral.\\n  - Late large positive spike (t\u224891\u201394): visible in the line plot but not strongly highlighted in SHAP (low or neutral contribution) \u2192 neutral/weakly-typical from the model's perspective.\\n  - Frequency-wise: the model focuses on the very-low-frequency components (0 Hz and adjacent low rows); intermediate- and high-frequency rows show little SHAP importance (and no broad blue blocks), so jitter/high-frequency content is not decisive here.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Summarize the sample's feature pattern (sequence + heatmap labeling):\\n\\n- Early stage (t\u22480\u20138): small/brief positive transient (line plot) followed quickly by descent into trough. Heatmap: low-frequency rows near this early window show weak or neutral SHAP marking \u2192 ambiguous / weakly-typical.\\n- Early-mid stage (t\u22488\u201315): deep negative trough (largest negative amplitude in the trace). Heatmap: surprisingly not strongly red in the SHAP map for this sample (neutral/ambiguous), so the model is not relying on the trough as the primary typical cue here.\\n- Mid stage (t\u224820\u201334): recovery and sustained positive hump/plateau \u2014 this interval is strongly marked red at the 0 Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows in SHAP, i.e., the model treats this mid recovery hump as the most typical, decisive feature for classification.\\n- Late stage (t\u224835\u201390): baseline with small fluctuations (neutral / weakly-typical in SHAP).\\n- Very late (t\u224891\u201394): pronounced late positive spike in the waveform, but only weak/no SHAP importance (thus treated by the model as neutral or supporting at best).\\n\\nConcise feature-pattern statement: The sample consists of an early positive bump \u2192 very deep early trough \u2192 fast recovery into a clear mid positive hump (this mid hump is strongly flagged as the typical feature by the model via red 0Hz heatmap cells), followed by a quiet baseline region and a late spike which the model does not emphasize. The single dominant typical feature (per SHAP) is the mid recovery low-frequency hump; the deep trough and the early spike, though visually obvious, are not the strongest SHAP-identified typical cues in this instance (they are neutral/ambiguous in the heatmap).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match with provided label feature lists and patterns and pick most similar label:\\n\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 share the canonical morphological sequence (early positive transient \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery to positive hump \u2192 late plateau or optional late spike). So on waveform shape alone, the sample matches both labels well.\\n\\n- Where the labels differ in how the model views typicality: the label_1 summaries emphasize the deep negative valley (t\u224812\u201336) as the primary canonical low-frequency signature (the model often marks the trough low-frequency cells red for label_1). In contrast, label_0 descriptions also list the mid recovery positive hump (t\u224830\u201360) as a typical feature; several label_0 reference descriptions show the model marking both the early transient and the recovery hump strongly. In our sample, the SHAP heatmap places the clearest positive importance on the mid recovery hump (low-frequency rows around t\u224820\u201334) rather than on the trough.\\n\\n- Given that SHAP is the direct indicator of which time-frequency features the model considers typical for the sample's predicted class, the pattern (mid recovery hump strongly red; trough not strongly red) aligns more with the label_0 examples where the recovery hump (low-frequency) is used as a decisive typical feature. Reference sample 1 (label 0) shows a very similar global shape (early positive spike, deep trough, strong mid recovery marked red in low-frequency) and a similar STFT/heatmap emphasis on the recovery/hump region. The late large spike in our test sample is not emphasized by SHAP and therefore does not contradict the label_0 assignment.\\n\\n- Therefore the sample's feature pattern most closely matches the label_0 pattern in the provided summaries, because: (1) the canonical triad (early pos \u2192 deep trough \u2192 mid recovery) is present, (2) the model's SHAP highlights the mid recovery low-frequency energy as typical (a hallmark in the label_0 descriptions), and (3) there is good visual similarity to the label_0 reference sample (similar shape and STFT distribution), even though the trough is less emphasized by SHAP here.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and finalize confidence scoring:\\n\\n- Comparison with Reference Sample 1 (Label 0): Very similar waveform morphology (early positive spike, deep trough, clear mid recovery hump, later lower-amplitude region). The STFT patterns are comparable (dominant low-frequency energy during the trough\u2192recovery window) and the SHAP emphasis in the test sample on the mid recovery matches how the model treated the mid recovery in reference label_0 examples. This supports strong similarity.\\n\\n- Comparison with Reference Sample 2 (Label 1): While label_1 reference samples emphasize the deep trough's low-frequency block as the canonical marker, our sample's SHAP does not strongly highlight the trough block \u2014 it instead highlights the recovery block. That makes label_1 a less direct match even though shape overlaps.\\n\\n- Similarity scoring decision (1\u20134): The test sample matches the label_0 feature list strongly: the main morphological components (early positive bump, very deep trough, strong mid recovery) are present and the model's SHAP marks the mid recovery (a key label_0 typical feature in the library) as strongly typical. Considering both waveform morphology and the model's own feature importance map align with label_0, I assign a high similarity score of 4 (high similarity, >80% of main features matched). The only small divergence is that the model did not mark the trough as strongly typical in SHAP for this particular sample, but that does not outweigh the overall strong pattern match with label_0.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 with high confidence.\"\n    ]\n}",

Thus the sample\u2019s large trough does not act as an atypical, boundary-causing element in the model's internal attribution.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 comparison to the provided misclassification patterns and final judgement:\",\n    \"- The provided misclassification summaries hinge on the early or mid sustained negative DC trough being flagged as ATYPICAL (blue) for a given label (e.g., label_1 examples where an early deep negative baseline is blue and drives a misclassification to the other class; label_0 examples where a mid-phase deep negative valley is blue). In this sample the same morphological trough is present in the waveform but the SHAP heatmap shows RED-dominance at 0Hz for that trough (typical), i.e. the model does not treat it as the atypical DC signature that previously produced boundary misclassifications.\",\n    \"- The sample therefore contains many of the same raw waveform motifs that appear in the misclassification examples (deep trough + recovery plateau + late spike), but the model\u2019s attribution (SHAP) marks the influential low-frequency energy windows as typical (red), not atypical (blue). Because the key atypical DC markings that drove misclassification in the provided examples are absent here, this sample is unlikely to follow the same boundary/misclassification behavior.\",\n    \"- Approximate logits reasoning: boundary examples described in the prompt had large negative SHAP contributions in the early DC windows that could outweigh later positive contributions and flip the predicted label (net logit shift toward the incorrect class). In those cases the model\u2019s summed contributions produced a noticeable margin favoring the wrong class. For this sample, because the dominant DC windows are red (positive SHAP for the true label), the net summed contribution should favor the true class by a moderate margin (i.e., not the weak/near-zero logit differences typical of boundary misclassifications). In plain terms: where misclassified boundary samples might show near-zero or negative net logit difference for the true class (making flips likely), this sample\u2019s SHAP pattern implies a positive net logit margin (lower risk of flip).\",\n    \"- Conclusion: the sample does not match the key heatmap-signature of either provided misclassification group (label_1 or label_0). It therefore should NOT be considered a typical misclassification case for the black-box model.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Final decision: 'no' (low similarity to the documented misclassification patterns). Score explanation: 2 = some raw-feature similarity (same morphological motifs exist) but the SHAP coloring contradicts the atypical/DC-flag signature that causes misclassification, so similarity is limited.\"\n  ]\n}",

(b) A pronounced deep negative valley from about t\u22486\u201326 with minimum near \u22122.3 to \u22122.6 (broad, smooth trough). (c) Recovery crossing baseline around t\u224832\u201336 and a sustained mid positive hump/plateau from t\u224834\u201360 with typical amplitude 0.2\u20131.8 and modest local variability. (d) Mid-late interval (t\u224860\u201386) mild fluctuations around baseline with small bumps (mostly low amplitude). (e) Very large late positive spike at t\u224889\u201392 reaching \u2248 +3.0\u20133.2, immediately followed by a rapid negative rebound around t\u224893\u201395 down to \u2248 \u22121.0 to \u22121.3.\\n- Time-frequency image: High energy concentrated in the very-low-frequency row (0 Hz and adjacent lowest-frequency rows) during the early-to-mid trough window (roughly corresponding to the broad negative valley). There is also substantial low-frequency energy during the recovery/hump interval and a distinct energy concentration in the late-time window corresponding to the large late spike. Intermediate frequencies show some energy during transitions but are not dominant.\\n- SHAP heatmap (interpretation of typical/atypical): The lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows) are strongly red (positive SHAP) in the early-to-mid trough window (roughly t\u224815\u201335), indicating the model considers the deep trough\u2019s low-frequency energy a typical feature. The low-frequency rows are also red in the mid recovery window and show red in the late-time block aligned with the large late spike and immediate rebound. There are small patches of blue at some intermediate-frequency rows during transitions (indicative of some ambiguous/atypical jitter components), but these are limited. Conclusion per region: deep trough low-frequency = typical (red); mid recovery low-frequency = typical; late large spike low-frequency and some adjacent mid-low frequency = typical; small intermediate-frequency spread = ambiguous/occasionally atypical.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Summary feature pattern for Sample 24:\\n- Ordered pattern: early small positive bump \u2192 deep broad negative trough (dominant) \u2192 recovery into sustained positive hump/plateau \u2192 mid-late low-amplitude fluctuations \u2192 very large late positive spike with immediate negative rebound. \\n- For each feature the heatmap role: (1) Early small positive transient: low-frequency cells slightly red (typical/supporting). (2) Deep negative valley (t\u22486\u201326): very strongly red in 0 Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows (clearly typical). (3) Recovery/hump (t\u224834\u201360): red in low-frequency rows (typical). (4) Mid-late small jitter: small blue/neutral marks in intermediate frequencies (ambiguous/atypical). (5) Late large spike + post-spike rebound: low-frequency and some adjacent frequencies marked red (treated as typical by model). Overall the model strongly favors low-frequency energy in the trough and in the late spike as typical evidence; higher-frequency jitter components are not considered typical.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists/patterns:\\n- Comparing to the provided label summaries, Sample 24 matches the canonical pattern described for label 1 (normal heartbeat): early small positive transient \u2192 pronounced low-frequency deep valley \u2192 recovery to positive hump/plateau \u2192 optional late large spike with post-spike rebound. The heatmap marking (strong red at the 0Hz/lowest frequency rows during the deep trough and during the late spike/rebound) exactly matches the label-1 description that the model treats the deep valley and recovery (and in some samples a large late spike + rebound) as typical features. Intermediate-frequency jitter being ambiguous/blue is also consistent with the label-1 summaries which note jitter is sometimes considered atypical.\\n- By contrast, while label 0 samples can show an early positive transient + deep trough + recovery hump, label-0 descriptions emphasize an early sharp positive transient in some cases and somewhat different patterns of intermediate-frequency dispersion; crucially the provided label-1 summaries explicitly list the late very large positive spike + rapid post-spike rebound as part of typical label-1 patterns (Samples 19 and 2). Sample 24 contains such a late pronounced spike and rebound that the heatmap marks as typical \u2014 a strong discriminator favoring label 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Reference-check and final judgment:\\n- Reference sample 2 (label 1) shows a very similar structure to Sample 24: early small bump, deep trough, recovery plateau, and a prominent late spike with rebound; its STFT and typical low-frequency SHAP pattern match Sample 24\u2019s signatures. Reference sample 1 (label 0) shares the trough\u2192recovery motif but lacks the same late spike+rebound being treated as typical; Sample 24\u2019s late spike being strongly red aligns it more with label-1 reference behavior.\\n- Therefore the most consistent classification is label 1. The matching is strong across the main diagnostic features (deep low-frequency trough, recovery hump, and late large spike + rebound), and the SHAP heatmap confirms these are considered typical by the model. Minor ambiguous/atypical intermediate-frequency jitter does not overturn the dominant low-frequency matches.\\n\\nFinal assignment: label 1 (normal heartbeat).

This is the dominant negative event.\\n  - Mid recovery / sustained positive hump (t \u2248 30\u201360): the signal rises through baseline to a moderate positive plateau with local maxima near +1.0\u2013+1.8, then mild fluctuations around baseline afterwards.\\n  - Late very large positive spike and rapid rebound (t \u2248 86\u201392 followed by 93\u201395): a sharp large positive peak reaching \u2248 +3.0\u2013+3.2 and immediately followed by a quick negative rebound down to roughly \u22121.0 to \u22121.3.\\n  - Throughout the mid/late plateau there are small-amplitude jitters but no persistent high-amplitude high-frequency oscillation.\\n\\n- Time-frequency (STFT):\\n  - Strong energy concentrated at the lowest frequency row (0 Hz and immediately adjacent very-low-frequency rows) during the early\u2013mid trough time window (~t 10\u201330), indicating the trough is dominated by low-frequency content.\\n  - Low-frequency energy is again visible during the mid recovery and is concentrated (not widely dispersed).\\n  - The late large spike shows pronounced energy in low frequencies and some spread into adjacent intermediate-frequency rows (consistent with a relatively sharp, fast event with some faster components). High-frequency (> ~0.3) energy is minimal.\\n\\n- SHAP heatmap (typicality/atypicality):\\n  - 0 Hz and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows during the early\u2013mid trough window are strongly red \u2014 the model regards that low-frequency trough energy as a typical, positive contributor to the predicted label.\\n  - Low-frequency rows during the mid recovery/hump are mostly light-red to red \u2014 treated as typical/supportive.\\n  - The late-time block corresponding to the large spike and immediate rebound shows red in low-frequency rows and some red in adjacent mid-low frequency rows \u2014 the model treats the late spike (and its slower components) as typical as well.\\n  - Intermediate-frequency rows during transition windows show a mix of light-blue and light-red (some ambiguity). These blues represent minor atypical/high-frequency jitter components, but they are limited in extent and amplitude in the heatmap.\\n\\n- Judgement of each feature per heatmap rules:\\n  - Early small positive transient: low-frequency cells mildly red \u2192 Typical (supporting).\\n  - Broad deep negative trough (dominant): 0Hz + adjacent low-frequency rows strongly red \u2192 Clearly typical for the predicted label.\\n  - Mid recovery / positive hump: low-frequency red/light-red \u2192 Typical or weakly typical.\\n  - Late very large spike + rapid rebound: low-frequency red and some adjacent mid-low-frequency red \u2192 Treated as typical by the model.\\n  - Intermediate-frequency jitter during transitions: mixed blue/red in intermediate rows \u2192 Ambiguous / partially atypical but not dominant.\\n\\nSummary of Step 1: the sample contains the canonical sequence early bump \u2192 deep low-frequency trough \u2192 recovery hump \u2192 late large spike + rebound. SHAP marks the key low-frequency regions (trough and late spike) as red/typical. Only modest intermediate-frequency blue patches exist around transitions, indicating minor ambiguity for fast jitter components.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Evaluate the black-box model's logits and confidence using heatmap evidence:\\n- Provided logits: [-1.3253123760223389, 2.642702341079712]. Converting to probabilities by softmax yields approximately p(label0) \u2248 0.0186 and p(label1) \u2248 0.9814. The model margin strongly favors label 1 (very high confidence).\\n- Heatmap corroboration: the most important time-frequency blocks for decision (0Hz low-frequency rows during the trough and late spike windows) are strongly red, meaning the model relies on features in those blocks as typical for its chosen class. There are only limited blue/mixed regions confined to intermediate-frequency rows during transitions.\\n- According to the heatmap interpretation rules, red-dominant key regions indicate the model is confident and sees typical features of its predicted label. The strong logit margin together with red-marked canonical regions implies the model's internal evidence strongly supports label 1.\\n- Is this a boundary sample? No: the dominant diagnostic regions are red and align tightly with label-1 canonical features (deep low-freq trough + recovery + late spike). The limited blue in intermediate bands does not produce broad confusion. Thus the sample is not a borderline / highly ambiguous case for the model; it is treated as a typical label-1 instance by the model.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Cross-check with label summaries and the three assistants:\\n- The label summaries describe label 1 as: early small positive transient \u2192 pronounced low-frequency deep valley (~t12\u201336) \u2192 recovery to positive hump \u2192 optional late spike/rebound. The model\u2019s SHAP emphasis (low-frequency red on trough and late spike) matches this description precisely.\\n- Label 0 summaries can include troughs and recoveries but emphasize different characteristic patterns in some reference samples (e.g., very sharp early spikes or differing intermediate-frequency signatures). The presence of a late very large spike + rebound that the heatmap treats as typical aligns particularly well with label-1 reference samples described in the documentation.\\n- All three independent assistants concluded label 1 with high similarity/confidence. Their analyses align with the same feature correspondences we observe (deep low-frequency trough marked red, late spike marked red, intermediate jitter ambiguous).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final assessment and decision verification:\\n- The model's high logit margin (\u224898% probability for label 1), the heatmap's red-dominant marking in the key low-frequency time blocks, the STFT energy placements, and agreement from three independent assistants all consistently support label 1.\\n- No strong contradictory evidence (for example, blue-dominated key regions or alternative low-frequency patterns typical of label 0) is present. The small intermediate-frequency blue patches indicate only minor ambiguity about fast jitter components and do not outweigh the dominant red signatures.\\n\\nFinal conclusion: label 1 is the most reasonable and well-supported classification. The black-box model's prediction (label 1) is credible and confident for this sample; the sample should be considered a typical example of label 1 rather than a boundary case.\"\n    ]\n}"

Very little spread into intermediate or high-frequency rows \u2014 the energy is compact at low frequencies (indicating smooth, slow components rather than jitter). The STFT heatmap shows a high-magnitude (bright) low-frequency block aligned with the trough period and a smaller low-frequency block aligned with the early spike.\\n- Summary numeric ranges: early spike +3.0\u2013+3.3; trough \u22121.8 to \u22122.2; recovery hump up to \u2248+1.0\u2013+1.2. Signal is low-frequency dominated, low jitter.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Which sample features may cause misclassification (boundary properties):\\n- Overlap in canonical signatures: Both label_0 and label_1 reference descriptions include the same core morphological sequence: early positive transient \u2192 deep negative trough \u2192 recovery hump \u2192 plateau/late behavior. The deep, low-frequency trough (t\u224812\u201336) is emphasized in label_1 as its canonical discriminant, while label_0 descriptions emphasize the presence of a sharp, large early positive transient along with the trough/recovery. Because Sample 35 contains both a pronounced early sharp spike and a canonical deep low-frequency trough, it is inherently a boundary/ambiguous case.\\n- Candidate confusing features:\\n  * The deep low-frequency trough is a primary typical marker for label_1 (so its presence can attract label_1). \\n  * The very large early sharp positive transient is a strong typical marker for label_0 (so its presence can attract label_0). \\n  * Minimal intermediate-frequency spread (lack of jitter) reduces evidence that would disambiguate one label from the other if either label had been characterized by more high-frequency energy in similar cases.\\n- Likely cause of misclassification by models: model heuristics weighting the early sharp spike more heavily (or learned features giving more weight to early spike amplitude/timing) can push the decision to label_0, while heuristics focusing on the low-frequency trough magnitude/timing push toward label_1. Because both are present and both are strong, small differences in learned weighting yield different outputs.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching sample features to label summaries (avoiding blind reliance on misclassification cues):\\n- Match to label_0 summary: strong alignment. Label_0 typical features include a very sharp early positive transient (t\u22648), a broad deep negative trough (t\u22488\u201330), and a mid recovery positive hump (t\u224830\u201360). Sample 35 has all these in timing and amplitude; the particularly large early spike is a close match to label_0 prototypes.\\n- Match to label_1 summary: also strong alignment. Label_1 canonical fingerprint emphasizes the deep low-frequency valley in ~t12\u201336 then recovery to a positive plateau. Sample 35\u2019s trough is exactly in that window and is low-frequency dominated. The recovery and plateau match label_1 morphology as well.\\n- Critical note (do not treat misclassification as ground truth): because both labels list the same sequence (with different emphasis), the mere presence of both features does not uniquely identify the label. We must rely on which features are more discriminative per the provided summaries: label_0 tends to emphasize the early sharp positive transient more, label_1 emphasizes the trough low-frequency block. Sample 35 contains both, but the early spike is unusually large (making it a stronger label_0 cue), while the trough is also prototypical (label_1 cue). Therefore this is a borderline instance where either label is plausible depending on the decision rule.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Weighing the black-box model, assistants, and final judgment:\\n- Black-box model: predicted label_0. Logits given: [-0.2684, -1.0370]. Translating to softmax-like probabilities gives an approximate model belief favoring label_0 (\u223c0.68 vs \u223c0.32 roughly), so the model prefers label_0 with moderate confidence. The model therefore likely emphasized early spike + trough combination in a way that favors label_0.\\n- Three assistants: two assigned label_0 (scores 4 and 3) and one assigned label_1 (score 4). Their analyses align with the boundary nature: they all extracted the same features but weighed the early spike differently. The plurality of independent analyses favored label_0.\\n- Final assessment: considering (a) the unusually large, very sharp early positive transient (a distinctive label_0 marker in the provided summaries), (b) the full presence of label_0-typical trough + recovery timing, (c) the STFT showing low-frequency dominance consistent with both labels but not providing extra evidence for label_1 over label_0, and (d) the black-box model\u2019s prediction and two of three assistants favoring label_0, the most reasonable final classification is label_0. The primary reason is that the early spike amplitude and sharpness are more discriminative toward label_0 in the provided feature descriptions; the trough alone would support label_1, but here it co-occurs with a prototypical label_0 early spike.\\n- Alternative: label_1 is a plausible alternative because the deep low-frequency trough centered in the canonical window and the smooth recovery are textbook label_1 indicators. If one weighted trough/low-frequency energy as the decisive feature and down-weighted the early spike, label_1 would be selected. Thus label_1 is the alternate classification with lower preference.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Verification of reasoning and final result:\\n- Verified that extracted features match image evidence (line-plot peaks/valleys and STFT low-frequency energy blocks). \\n- Confirmed the sample is a boundary case because both label-0 and label-1 hallmark features are present. \\n- Ensured not to treat the black-box or other assistants\u2019 possible misclassification as authoritative; instead used the feature lists and the observed prominence of the early spike to tip the decision.\\n\\nConclusion: label_0 is the most consistent assignment given the particularly large early sharp positive transient (a discriminative label_0 cue) combined with the subsequent trough and recovery. The alternative (label_1) remains plausible because the mid trough is prototypical for label_1; hence label_1 is listed as the reasonable alternative but not the primary choice.\"\n  ]\n}"

The descent is relatively gradual and the trough is broad (many time steps) with low volatility (smooth, no heavy jitter at trough).\\n- Mid recovery / positive hump (t \u2248 30\u201340): steady recovery crossing y=0 near t\u224834 and reaching a broad positive hump/plateau with peak amplitude \u22481.2\u20131.4 centered around t\u224834\u201338. The recovery is relatively smooth and sustained.\\n- Middle-to-late plateau (t \u2248 40\u201385): after the hump the signal slowly decays toward baseline, with small low-amplitude fluctuations around 0 (mild negative drift near t\u224870\u201385). No large high-frequency jitter dominates this interval.\\n- Late-stage large positive spike + rebound (t \u2248 88\u201394): a distinct, abrupt late positive peak reaching \u2248+3.0 around t\u224890\u201392, followed by a rapid fall to slightly negative at the final time steps (short post-peak negative rebound).\\n- Time-frequency (STFT) observations: strong energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows during the early-to-mid trough and the mid recovery windows (roughly matching the deep valley and recovery times). There is moderate low-frequency energy in the middle/late windows (60\u201380) corresponding to the plateau/slow fluctuations. There is no widespread, persistent energy spread across many intermediate or high-frequency rows (i.e., limited high-frequency jitter). The STFT thus indicates the major events (trough and recovery, and some middle/late energy) are dominated by low-frequency content.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern summary (phase decomposition):\\n- Phase A (early): small positive transient (modest amplitude), not an extreme/very sharp spike.\\n- Phase B (early-to-mid): broad, deep negative trough (largest negative magnitude ~-2.2), smooth and low volatility.\\n- Phase C (mid): smooth recovery to a sustained positive hump (\u2248+1.2\u20131.4) with dominant low-frequency energy.\\n- Phase D (mid-late): low-amplitude plateau with small fluctuations around baseline.\\n- Phase E (late): pronounced late high-amplitude positive spike (~+3.0) with a rapid post-spike negative rebound.\\nCombined pattern: early small bump \u2192 pronounced low-frequency deep trough \u2192 smooth low-frequency recovery to positive plateau \u2192 low-amplitude plateau \u2192 late large spike + post-spike rebound.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists and scoring rationale:\\n- Label 1 (normal heartbeat) summary keys: early small positive transient, pronounced deep low-frequency valley (~t12\u201336), recovery crossing y=0 to positive hump (t36\u201355), low-amplitude late plateau and optional late large positive spike (t\u224886\u201392) often treated as typical; high-frequency jitter is usually atypical.\\n- Label 0 (myocardial infarction) summary keys: also contains early sharp positive transient (sometimes larger), early-mid deep negative trough, mid recovery hump, and sometimes a late secondary positive peak; intermediate-frequency jitter is often atypical for label 0 as well.\\n- For sample 49: the dominant features (deep low-frequency trough, smooth low-frequency recovery to a positive hump, an early modest bump rather than a very large sharp initial spike, and an optional large late spike + rebound) align strongly with the canonical label-1 pattern described in the reference material. The STFT low-frequency concentration during the trough and the recovery is exactly the time-frequency fingerprint called out as typical for label 1. The late very large spike + rapid rebound is explicitly noted as a typical/acceptable variant in several label-1 references (e.g., Sample 19 in the documentation). The lack of broad high-frequency spread (little jitter) also matches label-1 expectations (jitter would be atypical).\\n- Differences vs. label 0: label-0 examples sometimes show a larger, very sharp early positive transient (higher early amplitude) in several reference label-0 samples; sample 49's early transient is modest (more consistent with label 1's \\\"early small positive transient\\\" description). While label 0 shares many morphological stages with label 1 (thus creating boundary ambiguity), the strongest pattern matches (deep low-frequency valley + smooth recovery + later spike variant) more closely mirror the label-1 canonical description and the provided label-1 reference examples.\\n- Quantified matching decision: label 1 receives the highest match score. Because the majority of the main features (early small bump, dominant deep low-frequency trough, smooth low-frequency recovery to a positive hump, and the presence of a late large spike that is treated as typical for some label-1 samples) align closely and because STFT energy distribution supports this, I assign the highest similarity rating: 4 (High similarity, \u227380% feature match).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and misclassification risk:\\n- Similar references labeled 1 (Samples 81, 36, 25): these show very similar morphology (modest early bump, deep trough to ~-2.0, smooth recovery to ~+1.0, and a prominent late spike) and similar STFT low-frequency concentration during trough & recovery. Sample 49 visually matches these label-1 references strongly.\\n- Similar reference labeled 0 (Sample 86) and dissimilar references labeled 0 (Samples 0 and 93) show patterns that can also look similar (deep trough and recovery plus late spikes). This explains the boundary nature and why a black-box classifier might confuse labels. However, compared to those label-0 references, sample 49's early transient amplitude is smaller (more like label-1 examples) and the STFT energy distribution fits label-1's canonical low-frequency valley+recovery pattern.\\n- Therefore, although there is legitimate ambiguity (some label-0 samples share many of these patterns), the weight of evidence (morphology + frequency-domain concentration + agreement with multiple label-1 references) favors label 1. The classification is given with high confidence relative to the provided label summaries, but one should note this is a boundary case where some label-0 examples are visually similar and could cause model confusion in practice.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 1 (score = 4).\"\n    ]\n}",

Morphology: brief rise then rapid fall. Volatility: smooth, no strong jitter.\\n- Early-to-mid stage trough (t \u2248 6\u201326): pronounced broad negative valley whose nadir is about \u22122.0 to \u22122.3 (largest negative excursion). Morphology: gradual descent, smooth sustained trough and slow recovery (low volatility at trough).\\n- Mid stage recovery / positive hump (t \u2248 30\u201345): robust recovery crossing baseline into a sustained positive hump; local maxima around \u2248 +1.2\u2013+1.4 (broad hump rather than a single sharp spike). Morphology: smooth, sustained above-zero region with mild slope-down afterward.\\n- Late middle stage (t \u2248 55\u201385): gradual decline from the hump toward baseline and then a low-amplitude slightly negative/near-zero plateau between about \u22120.4 and +0.2. Small fluctuations but overall low amplitude (no large high-frequency jitter).\\n- Late stage (t \u2248 88\u201393): a large, sharp late positive spike reaching \u2248 +3.0 followed by a quick fall back toward ~0 at the end. This late spike is high-amplitude and relatively short in duration.\\n- Frequency-domain (STFT) notes: two main low-frequency energy blocks are visible: a dominant low-frequency concentration during the early-to-mid window that maps to the deep trough and recovery (strong energy at the lowest frequency rows), and a sustained low-frequency presence through the mid-late time window. The late large spike is represented more weakly in the STFT image provided (likely because of short duration or STFT resolution), but the mid-late block shows moderate low-frequency energy. There is little spread into intermediate/high-frequency rows (i.e., transitions are mostly low-frequency, smooth), so jitter and high-frequency spread are minimal.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern summary (phase decomposition):\\n- Phase A (early): small positive transient (t 0\u20135) \u2014 smooth, low-frequency.\\n- Phase B (early\u2192mid): broad, deep negative trough (t 6\u201326) with largest negative amplitude \u2248 \u22122.0 to \u22122.3, dominated by low-frequency energy.\\n- Phase C (mid): recovery to a sustained positive hump (t 30\u201345) with amplitude \u2248 +1.2\u2013+1.4, again low-frequency and smooth.\\n- Phase D (late middle): low-amplitude near-zero/ slightly negative plateau (t 55\u201385) with small fluctuations but no strong high-frequency content.\\n- Phase E (late): a distinct late high-amplitude positive spike (t \u2248 88\u201393, \u2248 +3.0) and fast return toward baseline.\\nOverall pattern: early positive bump \u2192 pronounced low-frequency deep negative valley \u2192 smooth recovery to positive hump \u2192 low-amplitude plateau \u2192 late strong positive spike. Frequency content concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows during major amplitude events; minimal intermediate-frequency spread (low jitter).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping sample pattern to label feature summaries and initial similarity scoring:\\n- Label 1 (normal heartbeat) typical features include: early small positive transient; pronounced deep low-frequency valley around t \u2248 12\u201336; recovery hump crossing zero at mid times; late low-amplitude plateau and optional late spike (the model\u2019s heatmaps show strong red in low-frequency rows for these windows). Sample 49 matches these items strongly: it has the same early bump, deep trough centered in the early-mid region with dominant low-frequency energy, smooth recovery hump, and an optional late high positive spike. Also STFT shows low-frequency energy concentrated where expected and little high-frequency jitter. Degree of match: high. (Similarity score for label 1: 4/4.)\\n- Label 0 (myocardial infarction) typical features (from the provided summary) can also include early sharp positive transients, deep negative troughs, mid recovery humps, and sometimes late positive peaks \u2014 in other words there is overlap with label 1 on the major low-frequency morphological events. The differences called out for label 0 include that intermediate-frequency spread (jitter) can be atypical/ambiguous and some samples show sharper early spikes or specific timing differences. Sample 49 shares several features with label 0 (early positive transient, deep trough, mid recovery, occasional late peak), but sample 49 exhibits smoother low-frequency transitions and minimal intermediate-frequency jitter \u2014 a pattern more consistently described as typical for label 1 in the provided summaries and reference examples. Degree of match: moderate\u2013high but not as convincing as for label 1. (Similarity score for label 0: 3/4.)\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision reasoning:\\n- Reference similarity: three of the close similar examples (Samples 81, 36, 25) are labeled 1 and their line plots + STFTs show almost the same sequence (small early bump \u2192 deep trough \u2248 \u22122 \u2192 recovery hump around t\u224834\u201345 \u2192 late large spike near t\u224890) with low-frequency-dominated STFT energy \u2014 visually and spectrally they are highly consistent with sample 49. One of the 'similar' examples (Sample 86) is labeled 0 but its waveform and STFT are also similar to 49; this demonstrates class overlap in the dataset and why this is a boundary case. The two dissimilar references (Samples 93 and 0, both label 0) show differences in timing, frequency spread, or overall morphological shape that move them further from sample 49.\\n- Important distinction: both labels share the canonical valley\u2192recovery morphology; the deciding factors in the provided summaries are (a) whether the key low-frequency valley + recovery + late spike pattern is treated as a typical signature (red in heatmaps) for label 1, and (b) whether intermediate-frequency jitter or atypical localized 0Hz anomalies are present (which would push away from label 1). Sample 49 shows the canonical low-frequency valley + recovery + late spike with minimal jitter, aligning strongly to label 1\u2019s typical signature.\\n- Considering the strong agreement with multiple label-1 reference cases, the STFT\u2019s concentrated low-frequency energy in the trough/recovery window, and the lack of strong atypical intermediate-frequency spread that the label-0 summary sometimes emphasizes, the most accurate classification is label 1 (normal heartbeat).\\n\\nFinal per-label similarity quantification (1\u20134 scale):\\n- Label 1: 4 (High similarity \u2014 main features and time-frequency pattern match the label-1 canonical pattern and multiple label-1 reference samples.)\\n- Label 0: 3 (Moderate similarity \u2014 shares many primary morphological components with label 0, but lacks some of the intermediate/high-frequency atypical signatures that would more strongly favor label 0.)\\n\\nConclusion: classify Test sample 49 as label 1.

The STFT shows concentrated low-frequency energy (lowest frequency rows) during the trough and the recovery/hump windows; there is limited spread into intermediate frequencies (i.e., minimal broad high-frequency jitter) across most of the trace.\\n\\n- Phase A (early, t \u2248 0\u20136): small positive transient. Amplitude roughly +1.0 to +1.4 (brief peak near t\u22482\u20134). Morphology: short-duration bump, smooth, not extremely sharp. STFT: small low-frequency energy at the same early window.\\n\\n- Phase B (early\u2192mid trough, t \u2248 6\u201326): broad, deep negative valley reaching approximately -2.0 to -2.3 (minimum around t\u224820\u201325). Morphology: gradual descent and a wide trough (many points), low volatility (smooth). STFT: strong energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows in roughly the same time window \u2014 a dominant low-frequency block consistent with large slow deviation from baseline.\\n\\n- Phase C (mid recovery, t \u2248 30\u201345): smooth, sustained positive hump with local maxima \u2248 +1.2\u2013+1.4 around t\u224834\u201338, crossing above y=0. Morphology: broad plateau-like hump, low volatility. STFT: sustained low-frequency energy across this recovery/hump interval.\\n\\n- Phase D (mid/late plateau, t \u2248 45\u201385): slow decay toward baseline and a low-amplitude near-zero plateau (values roughly between -0.4 and +0.4), with only small fluctuations and no dominant high-frequency activity. STFT: low but present low-frequency energy; intermediate/higher rows show little persistent energy (i.e., not much jitter).\\n\\n- Phase E (very late, t \u2248 88\u201393): distinct, high-amplitude positive spike peaking \u2248 +3.0 at \u2248t=90\u201391, followed by a rapid fall toward baseline (small negative rebound at the end). Morphology: brief, high-amplitude transient; steeper flanks than earlier events. STFT: the STFT resolution/coverage provided shows only modest representation of this very-short event (short-duration events are less visible depending on STFT windowing), but the line plot makes the spike clear; other analyses note some intermediate-frequency spread associated with such abrupt events.\\n\\n- Volatility and frequency-content summary: the dominant energy for the largest deviations (trough and recovery hump) lies in the lowest-frequency rows (slow, smooth changes). High-frequency jitter is minimal across the trace; only the very-late spike contains faster components that can produce some intermediate-frequency energy in higher-resolution time-frequency analyses.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Which sample features may cause misclassification (boundary features) and why:\\n\\n- Overlap features shared by both labels: Both label 0 (myocardial infarction) and label 1 (normal heartbeat) descriptions contain the same core morphological stages: an early positive transient, a pronounced early-to-mid deep trough, a mid recovery hump, and sometimes a late positive peak. This morphological overlap is the primary reason the sample sits near a decision boundary: the exact sequence (bump \u2192 deep valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 late spike) is a pattern present in examples of both labels.\\n\\n- Specific confusing elements in this sample:\\n  - The broad deep trough (Phase B) is the most discriminative event in the dataset descriptions but is present in both labels' feature lists and therefore does not by itself determine class. Its presence at the canonical time window (\u224812\u201336) is strongly characteristic of label 1 in the reference summaries but also appears in label-0 examples \u2014 this duality causes ambiguity.\\n  - The very-late large positive spike (Phase E) is explicitly called out as a typical variant for some label-1 samples, but label-0 examples can also show late peaks. Because abrupt spikes often introduce intermediate-frequency energy, the spike's frequency footprint can sometimes be treated as atypical for one label and typical for another depending on context; that can cause a classifier to be uncertain.\\n  - The amplitude of the early transient can be discriminative in some references (label-0 examples sometimes have a sharper/larger early spike). In this sample the early transient is modest rather than extremely sharp, which pushes interpretation toward label 1; nevertheless, classifiers that over-weight early spike amplitude could be misled if they expect a very sharp early spike for one label.\\n\\n- Features that reduce misclassification risk (i.e., support one label more clearly): the trough and recovery here are smooth and dominated by low-frequency energy (strongly aligning with label-1 descriptions that emphasize the canonical low-frequency valley+recovery fingerprint). The minimal intermediate/high-frequency jitter in transition windows also favors label 1 according to the provided label summaries (jitter/higher-frequency spread is often flagged atypical or ambiguous).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching the sample\u2019s features against the provided label feature summaries (preliminary judgment while excluding boundary-prone features as sole basis):\\n\\n- Strong matches to label 1:\\n  - Early small positive transient: present and similar in amplitude/morphology to label-1 reference examples.\\n  - Pronounced deep low-frequency trough in the early-to-mid window: timing and low-frequency concentration match the canonical label-1 fingerprint described in the dataset notes (strong red in reference heatmaps corresponds to this behavior).\\n  - Smooth recovery across baseline into a sustained positive hump: matches label-1 typical recovery behavior (again dominated by low-frequency energy).\\n  - Late-stage large spike and post-spike rebound: label-1 documentation explicitly describes such late spikes as present and treated as typical in several label-1 samples; thus the observed late spike is not uniquely indicative of label 0.\\n  - Low high-frequency jitter overall: consistent with label-1 (where wide intermediate-frequency spread is considered atypical).\\n\\n- Matches to label 0 (explains ambiguity but not decisive):\\n  - Label 0 also lists sequences containing early positive transients, deep troughs, recoveries and sometimes late peaks. Therefore the gross morphology fits both labels; label-0 references show similar shapes in several examples. However, the distinguishing emphasis for label 0 in the summaries is often on sharper early spikes or particular intermediate-frequency irregularities \u2014 features that are not dominant in this sample.\\n\\n- Preliminary judgment (without giving undue weight to the ambiguous features): The preponderance of features (timing, amplitudes, and especially the time-frequency concentration in the lowest-frequency bands for trough and recovery, plus a modest early spike and limited jitter) aligns more strongly with label 1. The overlapping presence of the same broad morphological pattern in label-0 makes this a boundary case, but the specific spectral and morphological details favor label 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Integration with the three assistants' analyses and the black-box model output; final classification reasoning:\\n\\n- Consensus from other assistants: All three independent assistants concluded label 1 with high similarity scores (score = 4). Their extraction of phases, amplitudes, and STFT observations closely matches the features summarized above.\\n\\n- Black-box model output: predicted label = 1 with logits [-0.729109, 2.453422]. Converting logits into probabilities by softmax yields a strong probability in favor of label 1 (approximate probability for label 1 \u2248 0.96, label 0 \u2248 0.04). The model's decision matches the feature-based judgment and the three assistants' consensus.\\n\\n- Cross-check & misclassification risk: The sample is a legitimate boundary/ambiguous instance because both labels can produce the same major waveform stages. But two decisive factors reduce misclassification risk here: (1) the trough + recovery are dominated by low-frequency energy (strongly typical for label 1 in the provided reference descriptions), and (2) the early positive transient is modest (consistent with label 1 rather than the sharper early spike more often seen in some label-0 examples). The late spike is allowed by label-1 examples in the references and therefore should not be counted against label 1. Given these, the strong softmax score toward label 1 is consistent with the evidence.\\n\\n- Final classification: label 1 is the most reasonable final classification. Alternative plausible classification: label 0 (because of shared morphology across labels and one or two label-0 reference examples that look similar) \u2014 this remains a secondary/alternative hypothesis but less supported by the detailed frequency/morphology evidence.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Verification and final statement of confidence:\\n\\n- Re-check for missed distinguishing pattern: The STFT shows the dominant energy confined to the lowest-frequency rows during the trough and recovery \u2014 a crucial diagnostic that I used and that strongly favors label 1. There is no persistent wide-band intermediate/high-frequency energy that would push the sample toward label 0 according to the label summaries. The early transient amplitude is moderate rather than large/sharp, which again aligns with label 1 references.\\n\\n- Conclusion and confidence: Final result = label 1 (normal heartbeat). This agrees with the black-box classifier and the three assistant analyses. Confidence: relatively high for this dataset's diagnostic features, but noting that the example is legitimately a boundary case because the same main morphological elements appear in some label-0 examples; label 0 therefore remains a reasonable alternative but is less likely given the frequency-domain concentration and the modest early transient.\\n\\nSummary (short): The waveform exhibits the canonical early bump \u2192 deep low-frequency trough \u2192 smooth recovery hump \u2192 near-zero plateau \u2192 late large spike sequence. The trough and recovery are dominated by low-frequency energy and there is minimal jitter. These characteristics match the label-1 profile more strongly than label-0. All three assistants and the black-box model also predicted label 1 (black-box softmax probability for label 1 \u2248 0.96). Therefore classify this sample as label 1, with label 0 noted as the plausible alternative due to morphological overlap across labels.\"\n    ]\n}"

The discriminating nuances are: label_1 examples and descriptions emphasize a canonical smooth valley\u2192recovery\u2192plateau with moderate late hump and dominant low-frequency energy (exactly what the test sample shows). Label_0 descriptions accept similar low-frequency events but frequently note intermediate-frequency spread (jitter/transition artifacts) or particular late sharp spikes in some samples; the test sample lacks those atypical high-frequency features and instead aligns more closely with the canonical label_1 depiction.\\n- Final classification choice: label 1 (normal heartbeat). This choice is made because the test sample's dominant features \u2014 strong low-frequency deep trough in the early-mid window, smooth recovery crossing zero, and a moderate sustained late hump with minimal intermediate-frequency spread \u2014 match the label_1 canonical fingerprint extremely well.

Also, the late event here is a moderate sustained hump, not an abrupt large spike \u2014 an important detail favoring label_1.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching the extracted sample features to the provided label summaries (preliminary judgment, discounting likely confusion features):\\n- Match to label_1 (normal heartbeat):\\n  * Early small/medium positive transient: present (match).\\n  * Pronounced deep negative valley in early\u2013mid window with concentrated low-frequency energy: present and strongly matching (this is the canonical fingerprint emphasized for label_1 in the summaries).\\n  * Smooth recovery that crosses baseline into a sustained positive hump/plateau: present and matches label_1 descriptors.\\n  * Late-stage moderate plateau/hump (not an abrupt extreme spike): present and matches typical label_1 late morphology.\\n  * Low intermediate/high-frequency spread (i.e., low jitter): present and consistent with typical label_1 patterns.\\n  => Overall the sample matches the canonical label_1 fingerprint very closely. This is the strongest match after discounting the general morphological overlap.\\n- Match to label_0 (myocardial infarction):\\n  * Label_0 contains many of the same morphological elements (early spike, deep trough, recovery, occasionally a late peak). The sample therefore shares some label_0 features as well. However, label_0 pattern descriptions and examples often include more intermediate-frequency spread/jitter during transitions or distinct abrupt late spikes \u2014 features absent here. The absence of these label_0-associated nuances reduces the weight toward label_0.\\n  => Overall match to label_0 is plausible (moderate) but not as clean as the match to label_1 when considering frequency-distribution nuances.\\n- Important methodological note: Because the gross morphology is shared, do not treat the presence of the deep trough alone as decisive; instead emphasize frequency spread, late spike shape, and whether events are sustained (low-frequency) versus jittery (intermediate-frequency). Using that discriminant, this sample is more consistent with label_1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Reconcile assistant consensus and black-box result to produce final classification and alternatives:\\n- Three other assistants independently concluded label 1 (each with high-similarity score \u22484) with detailed reasoning matching my feature extraction \u2014 they emphasize the same points: dominant low-frequency trough, smooth recovery, moderate late hump, minimal intermediate-frequency spread.\\n- Black-box model predicted label 0 (logits: [-0.3261, -0.9567]), i.e., the model favored label_0 slightly (difference in logits small). The prediction confidence is not strong (logits both negative and close), consistent with a borderline case. Likely causes for the model's label_0 decision: small learned biases (e.g., giving extra weight to early spike magnitude, to dual large low-frequency deflections, or to particular time-window magnitudes) and the existence in training data of visually very similar labeled-0 examples. Given these factors, the black-box misclassification is plausible but not decisive.\\n- Final decision reasoning: Weighting the low-frequency distribution, the shape of the late event (a moderate sustained hump rather than an abrupt high-frequency spike), and the minimal intermediate-frequency spread, the evidence leans to label_1. The majority of human-logic assessments (three assistants) also assign label_1. The black-box label_0 prediction is likely caused by boundary-condition similarity to some label_0 training examples or by a different weighting of spike magnitude. Because we must not take the black-box misclassification as primary evidence, I give the final label as label_1, and note label_0 as a plausible alternative for this borderline sample.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Final answer, verification and caveats:\\n- Final classification: label 1 (normal heartbeat). Rationale: the sample matches the canonical label_1 fingerprint (dominant low-frequency deep trough in the early\u2013mid window, smooth low-frequency recovery crossing baseline, moderate sustained late hump, minimal intermediate-frequency jitter). These discriminative frequency/time-frequency features outweigh the ambiguous overlapping morphology that could suggest label_0.\\n- Alternative classification: label 0 is plausible given the dataset's boundary cases and one highly similar reference labeled 0; the black-box model predicted label_0 with only a small logit margin. If an automated classifier gives label_0, it is likely relying on subtle feature weightings (early spike magnitude or particular training-instance biases) rather than on clear contradictory frequency evidence.\\n- Uncertainty statement: This is a borderline instance \u2014 the gross waveform is shared by both classes. The decisive cues are the lack of intermediate-frequency spread and the absence of an abrupt very-large late spike; both point to label_1. If future evidence (e.g., clinician labels or additional features) indicates that particular amplitude/time combinations correspond to myocardial infarction in this dataset, reclassification to label_0 could be justified, but based on the provided summaries and images label_1 is the best-supported result.\"\n  ]\n}"

In the SHAP heatmap this entire mid-phase low-frequency band is predominantly RED (strong positive SHAP values) concentrated on the 0 Hz row and adjacent low-frequency rows \u2192 judged TYPICAL (red) for the sample\u2019s model prediction (i.e., the model treats the mid trough\u2019s DC energy here as supporting the predicted label).\n- Recovery / late phase (t \u2248 34\u201355): fairly fast upward slope crossing 0 and reaching a plateau around +1.0\u2013+1.2 (peaking near t\u224845). STFT: low-frequency energy concentrated near 0 Hz during the ramp and plateau; some spread during the slope into adjacent low-frequency rows. SHAP: mixed but with light red in low-frequency rows around the ramp and plateau region, and a few mild blue spots in slightly higher low-frequency rows \u2192 judged AMBIGUOUS-to-TYPICAL (mostly red in key low-freq bins).\n- Late plateau / tail (t \u2248 55\u201396): slowly decreasing positive values toward 0 with small jitters (small amplitude).

In SHAP the dominant signature is RED in the low-frequency (0 Hz and adjacent rows) during the mid trough and during the early transient and recovery \u2014 i.e., the model treats these low-frequency components across the major events as typical for the predicted class.

The timing and amplitude ranges align closely with those label_0 patterns.\n- The main difference versus many of the label_0 misclassification cases in the documentation is the SHAP sign in the trough: the provided label_0 misclassification patterns often emphasize the mid trough being marked BLUE at the 0 Hz row (i.e., atypical and thus a driver of misclassification), whereas in this sample the 0 Hz / adjacent low-freq cells during the mid trough are predominantly RED (i.e., the model treats them as typical for its predicted label). Because of that, this sample contains the same morphological markers that make label_0 examples prone to boundary/misclassification behavior, but the SHAP coloring here indicates the model is currently interpreting those features as supporting (not opposing) its prediction.\n\nConclusion on misclassification risk and approximate logits:\n- Because the temporal morphology exactly matches the known label_0 boundary pattern (early large positive spike + broad, deep mid trough + late recovery), this sample is highly similar to examples that have caused misclassification in the past for label_0. I therefore flag it as matching the label_0 misclassification pattern. However, the SHAP heatmap here is predominantly red on the critical 0 Hz cells (mid trough) rather than blue; that suggests the model may currently accept the trough as typical and thus may not misclassify as often as the canonical boundary cases where the trough is strongly blue. For that reason I give a moderate-high confidence (score 3) rather than maximum confidence.\n- Typical logits behavior for these boundary patterns (when they do flip): the model\u2019s outputs tend to lie near the decision boundary with modest margins. For true label_0 examples that get misclassified, the model often produces logits that favor the wrong class by a small-to-moderate margin (logit difference in the range \u2248 0.4\u20131.5 in favor of the predicted/wrong class), corresponding roughly to predicted probabilities ~0.6\u20130.8 for the erroneous class. When the mid-trough is strongly blue in SHAP, the negative contribution from that region typically pushes summed logits across the threshold; when that trough is red (as here) the summed SHAP pushes toward the correct label and the model\u2019s logit margin tends to be larger in favor of the correct class.\n\nOverall judgement: the sample\u2019s waveform and time-frequency energy clearly belong to the label_0 misclassification family (so I return \"label 0\"), but because the SHAP attribution for the critical mid trough is RED (typical) rather than the problematic BLUE seen in many misclassified label_0 examples, the sample may be less likely than those canonical boundary cases to be misclassified \u2014 hence a moderate confidence score.",

This is a short-duration, high-amplitude positive spike. \\n  - Early\u2013mid stage (t \u2248 8\u201334): a pronounced, broad negative valley/trough developing from about t\u22488 and deepest near t\u224828\u201332 with amplitude \u2248 -2.0 to -2.3. The trough is wide and smooth (low volatility) rather than highly oscillatory. \\n  - Mid stage (t \u2248 34\u201360): a recovery that rises through zero and produces a sustained positive hump/plateau between t\u224840\u201355 with amplitudes \u2248 +0.8 to +1.2 (peak near 45\u201348). The recovery is relatively smooth with only modest local jitter. \\n  - Late stage (t \u2248 60\u201395): gradual decay of the hump to near baseline with a modest secondary positive bump around t\u224870\u201376 (amplitude \u2248 +0.6\u20130.9) and then small oscillations near zero with small negative dips near t\u224880\u201392.\\n- STFT / time-frequency image:\\n  - Strong low-frequency energy concentrated during the early positive spike and, especially, during the deep trough time window (roughly t\u224812\u201334). \\n  - The mid-stage recovery (t\u224834\u201360) also shows concentrated low-frequency energy (consistent with the broad sustained hump). \\n  - Little energy in high-frequency rows; intermediate-frequency energy is minor (some small spread during transitions), so the dominant spectral signature is in the lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz and immediate adjacent low-frequency rows).\\n- SHAP heatmap (model attribution):\\n  - The lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows) during the trough time window (\u2248t=15\u201334) are strongly red (high positive SHAP), indicating those low-frequency features are treated as strongly typical by the model for the sample's assigned label. \\n  - The low-frequency band during the mid recovery (\u2248t=40\u201360) is also predominantly red (typical). \\n  - The early short positive spike window shows light-to-moderate red in low-frequency rows (typical). \\n  - Intermediate frequency rows (\u22480.1\u20130.3) show only minor, mostly neutral to slightly blue tint in some mid-to-late windows (indicating minor atypical/ambiguous contribution), but these are small compared with the dominant red at the lowest frequencies.\\n- Determination of whether each feature manifestation is typical/atypical (by heatmap color):\\n  - Early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20136, low-frequency): red \u2192 typical. \\n  - Early\u2013mid broad deep negative trough (t\u22488\u201334, lowest-frequency rows): strongly red \u2192 typical (primary typical marker). \\n  - Mid recovery / positive hump (t\u224834\u201360, low-frequency rows): red \u2192 typical. \\n  - Late modest secondary bump / plateau (t\u224870\u201380, low-frequency rows): light red/neutral \u2192 weakly typical/supporting. \\n  - Intermediate-frequency spread or jitter during transitions: slight blue/neutral in a few cells \u2192 minor atypical/ambiguous contributions but not dominant.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Summarize the sample's feature pattern (phased):\\n- Early stage: very large, short positive spike (\u2248+3.0) that is marked as typical in the heatmap (low-frequency red). \\n- Early\u2013mid stage: broad, deep negative trough (\u2248 -2.0 to -2.3) from ~t=8 to ~t=34, with strong red at the lowest-frequency rows \u2014 this is the dominant typical signature. \\n- Mid stage: smooth recovery crossing zero and forming a sustained positive hump (\u2248+0.8\u20131.2) during t\u224834\u201360; low-frequency rows here are also red (typical). \\n- Late stage: small secondary bump and low-amplitude oscillations near baseline, weakly red/neutral at low-frequency rows (weakly typical); small intermediate-frequency blue patches indicate minor atypical jitter but these are not the model's main drivers.\\n- Overall pattern: early large positive transient \u2192 wide deep negative trough \u2192 smooth mid recovery to a sustained positive hump \u2192 weaker late plateau/bump. Low-frequency energy drives the model\u2019s attributions (red) across the trough and recovery windows; higher-frequency contributions are limited and slightly atypical.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare extracted pattern to provided label feature lists and patterns:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 descriptions include the same canonical morphological sequence: early positive transient \u2192 deep low-frequency valley (trough) \u2192 recovery to positive hump/plateau \u2192 optional late spike/plateau. In both labels the model treats concentrated low-frequency energy during the trough and recovery as typical (red). \\n- Key discriminant cues from the label summaries: \\n  - Label_0 emphasizes an early sharp positive transient, deep trough, mid recovery hump, and sometimes a late positive peak \u2014 all driven by low-frequency red attribution. \\n  - Label_1 likewise emphasizes early small positive transient, pronounced low-frequency deep valley (primary canonical marker), recovery, and sometimes a late spike. \\n- The sample matches the canonical pattern described for both labels, but a close comparison to the two provided reference samples shows stronger visual and attributional similarity to Reference sample 1 (Sample 23, Label 0): both have a very large early spike (~+2.5\u20133.0), a broad trough to \u2248 -2.0, and a mid recovery hump centered ~t\u224834\u201350 with very similar STFT low-frequency energy distribution and strong red SHAP at the trough and recovery. Reference sample 2 (Label 1) is also similar but its mid/late structure contains somewhat different mid-late fluctuations (and in the label_1 examples the late-stage very large spike and subsequent rebound are more characteristic in some samples). The dominant, model-typical low-frequency trough+recovery signature and a pronounced early sharp spike align particularly well with the reference label_0 example.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Decision reasoning and final label selection with similarity scoring:\\n- The model's SHAP heatmap for this test sample shows the principal discriminative features (deep trough at low-frequency and the recovery hump) are strongly marked as typical (red). This matches the canonical, strongly-typical low-frequency signature described for both labels. \\n- Given both labels share similar canonical patterns, I used the provided reference examples to break the tie. Test sample 78 closely resembles Reference sample 23 (Label 0) in the amplitude of the early spike, the depth and width of the trough, the timing and amplitude of the mid recovery hump, and the pattern of low-frequency attributions. \\n- Therefore the most consistent classification is label 0. The SHAP heatmap confirms the low-frequency trough and recovery are considered typical by the model (red), supporting assignment to the same pattern group as the label-0 reference.\\n\\nSimilarity score justification (4 = High similarity):\\n- The test sample matches the main features of the label_0 pattern (\u226580% of main features): early large positive transient, broad deep low-frequency trough, smooth mid recovery to a positive hump, and supporting late-stage small bump. The timing, amplitude ranges, and heatmap attributions closely align with the label_0 reference sample. Minor intermediate-frequency jitter is present but is a small atypical component and does not outweigh the low-frequency typical markers. Thus a high similarity score (4) to label 0 is warranted.\"\n    ]\n}",

The model will likely yield a clear logit margin in favor of the class consistent with the red mid-trough/plateau evidence (i.e., a confident score rather than a small borderline logit). For comparison, true boundary/misclassified cases typically have mixed/blue-dominant 0 Hz windows that produce net negative contributions and small logit margins (e.g., differences near 0 or slightly negative, |\u0394logit| \u2248 0.3\u20131.0). This sample\u2019s SHAP map indicates a stronger net positive contribution \u2014 I would expect a more decisive margin (\u0394logit toward the supported class on the order of \u2248 +1.0 or greater) rather than a near-zero boundary logit.\",\n        \"\",\n        \"Final judgment: although the morphology shares elements with the known misclassification family for label_0, the heatmap coloring shows the model treating the key mid-trough as typical (red) rather than atypical (blue). That removes the principal cause of boundary misclassification, so this sample is not likely to become a typical misclassification. Result: no.\"\n    ]\n}",

The model\u2019s strongest red signals for label 1 are concentrated in the 0 Hz/low-frequency rows during the deep-valley window; jitter/high-freq energy is often atypical.\\n- Label 0 summary: also often exhibits an early sharp positive transient and an early-mid deep negative trough and recovery, with low-frequency red during these events. However, the summaries for label 0 emphasize the early sharp positive transient as a typical event when the very-low-frequency row is red in the earliest window.\\n- For the test sample, the most prominent SHAP red region is the deep trough in the early\u2013mid window and the recovery hump \u2014 these are the primary typical cues in the heatmap, matching the label 1 canonical fingerprint (deep valley as primary canonical feature) very closely. The early spike exists but the heatmap does not show the early low-frequency rows being the primary red region, so the model does not rely on the early spike as the main typical marker for this sample. The presence of additional low-frequency red in a late block (t\u224875\u201395) further supports label 1 (label 1 commonly has supportive late plateau/late spike marked as typical in some samples).\\n- Conclusion from pattern matching: the sample matches the label 1 pattern more closely (deep low-frequency trough + low-frequency recovery hump + supportive late low-frequency energy). Therefore assign label 1 (normal heartbeat).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and scoring:\\n- Reference sample 1 (label 0) shows a sequence early positive spike \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery hump; in that reference the early positive transient is a clear typical marker (low-frequency red early). Our sample has a very large early spike but the SHAP heatmap does not mark the earliest low-frequency row as the dominant typical region \u2014 the model instead emphasizes the trough and recovery. That makes our sample less consistent with reference label 0's emphasis on an early typical spike.\\n- Reference sample 2 (label 1) shows the canonical valley\u2192recovery pattern with strong low-frequency red at the trough; that aligns closely with our sample\u2019s heatmap (strong red at trough) and waveform. The late weak hump/plateau with some low-freq red also matches label 1 references.\\n- Similarity scoring (chosen label 1): The test sample matches the main features of label 1 (deep valley at early\u2013mid with very strong low-frequency SHAP red, smooth recovery to positive hump, late low-frequency support). Most key features (>80%) align with the label 1 feature list and the reference sample 2, so I assign the highest similarity score of 4 (High similarity).\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1. Main reasons: the model\u2019s SHAP heatmap strongly flags the deep negative trough and the subsequent low-frequency recovery as typical (bright red at 0Hz rows in the mid-time window), and this mid-trough + recovery pattern is the canonical fingerprint for label 1 in the provided feature summaries. Although there is a large early spike in the waveform, the heatmap does not elevate that early spike to be the principal typical feature, so the overall pattern and the model\u2019s own importance map indicate label 1.\"\n    ]\n}"

This is the dominant TF block.\\n  - Low-frequency energy is also present during the recovery hump (~t34\u201350) and modestly during the late bump; there is little spread into higher frequency bands, indicating low jitter/high smoothness.\\n  - The early sharp positive transient shows low-frequency energy but not a wide high-frequency footprint.\\n- SHAP heatmap (model contribution coloring):\\n  - The trough time-window (approx t\u224812\u201334) shows strong red at the lowest-frequency rows (0Hz and adjacent rows) \u2014 these are strongly positive SHAP contributions (typical features for the predicted label).\\n  - The mid recovery and late modest bump also show light-to-moderate red in low-frequency rows (supporting/typical contributions).\\n  - A small localized blue patch appears at the absolute lowest-frequency cell(s) during the very early transient (the earliest time column in the 0Hz row) \u2014 a minor negative/atypical marking.\\n  - A small mid-frequency blue patch is visible around the recovery transition (localized), indicating a small intermediate-frequency contribution the model treats as atypical/ambiguous.\\n  - Overall, red dominates the trough and recovery low-frequency region; blue is sparse and localized to minor cells (early 0Hz cell and a tiny mid-frequency patch).\\n- Classification of manifestations by typicality (per heatmap rules):\\n  - Broad deep trough (t\u224812\u201334), low-frequency (0Hz & adjacent rows): typical (red, decisive).\\n  - Recovery hump (t\u224834\u201350), low-frequency: typical/supporting (light\u2013moderate red).\\n  - Early large positive transient: mixed \u2014 adjacent low-frequency components are neutral-to-slight-red (ambiguous/weakly-typical) but the absolute 0Hz early cell is slightly blue (minor atypical contribution).\\n  - Intermediate-frequency jitter components: minimal and localized; their blue marking is minor and does not dominate the attribution.\\n  - Late small bump/plateau: weakly typical (low-frequency light-red).\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Evaluate the black-box model\u2019s prediction and confidence:\\n- Model logits: [-3.337175130844116, 3.321147918701172]. The logit difference (~6.66) corresponds to a very large probability margin in favor of label 1 (roughly ~0.9987 for label 1 vs ~0.0013 for label 0 by softmax). This indicates the model is highly confident in its numerical score for label 1.\\n- Heatmap agreement with the numerical confidence: the SHAP heatmap shows a dominant red block coinciding with the broad trough and recovery (the primary discriminative event). According to the provided label summaries, the model treats a strong low-frequency deep trough + recovery as the canonical signature for label 1. The presence of a large, strongly-red low-frequency block thus aligns with the model\u2019s high logit for label 1 and supports high confidence.\\n- Potential confusion / boundary indicators: the early absolute 0Hz blue cell and a small mid-frequency blue patch introduce minor atypical signals, but they are localized and small compared with the large typical red trough region. The waveform morphology itself (early spike \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 late plateau) is shared across both labels in the summaries, so the decisive factor is which time-frequency components the model treats as typical. Here the model\u2019s SHAP emphasizes the trough/recovery low-frequency energy (favoring label 1). Therefore this is not a borderline case in the model\u2019s view \u2014 the dominant typical features outweigh the minor atypical marks.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Cross-check with label summaries and other assistants:\\n- The label summaries describe label 1 as: early small positive transient \u2192 pronounced deep low-frequency valley (~t12\u201336) \u2192 recovery to positive hump \u2192 late plateau/optional late spike; and they emphasize that the deep low-frequency valley is the primary canonical marker (0Hz & adjacent low-frequency rows marked red in label 1 examples).\\n- The sample\u2019s dominant SHAP red region occurs precisely at the trough and recovery low-frequency rows, matching label 1\u2019s canonical fingerprint.\\n- All three independent assistants concluded label 1 with high similarity scores and provided nearly identical reasoning (they all pointed to the same decisive deep trough & red low-frequency SHAP block). The black-box model also predicted label 1 with a very strong logit margin. These three independent sources plus the heatmap are consistent.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final judgment about credibility and final classification:\\n- Credibility assessment: The black-box model\u2019s prediction of label 1 is credible. The very large logit margin indicates high model confidence numerically, and the SHAP heatmap shows that the model\u2019s confidence is based on a large, typical feature block (deep trough and recovery in low-frequency rows) rather than on spurious or widely conflicting signals. The small blue spots (early 0Hz cell and tiny mid-frequency patch) are minor and localized, so they do not meaningfully undermine the prediction.\\n- Risk of misclassification: Low in this case. Although waveform morphology is similar between labels in general, the heatmap shows clear feature-level preference for label 1\u2019s canonical low-frequency trough signature. That makes this sample a typical label-1 example for the model rather than a boundary sample.\\n- Final classification decision: label 1 (normal heartbeat). This matches the black-box model and the three assistants; given the dominant typical features, the high logit margin, and consistent SHAP support, label 1 is the most reasonable and supported result.\"\n  ]\n}"

Morphology: low amplitude, not sharp or very steep. Volatility: low.\\n- Early\u2013mid stage (t \u2248 8\u201328): a pronounced, broad negative trough reaching about \u22122.3 to \u22122.6 (largest negative excursion).

There is only modest spread into intermediate frequencies during transitions; overall the main events are dominated by low-frequency content (no wide-band high-frequency jitter).\\n- Summary of sample feature pattern: small early bump \u2192 deep broad low-frequency trough \u2192 smooth low-frequency recovery to a sustained positive plateau \u2192 late large positive spike with quick decay. Volatility is generally low; the STFT shows concentrated low-frequency energy for the core events.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Which features could cause misclassification / boundary behavior:\\n- Shared core features for both labels: both label_0 and label_1 descriptions include a deep early-to-mid negative trough followed by recovery and sometimes a late positive peak. Because these central elements are common, they make the sample inherently boundary-like.\\n- Potential label_0-like cues that could confuse a classifier: label_0 examples often highlight an early sharp positive transient in some cases and intermediate-frequency jitter during transitions. If a classifier weighs any early positive spike or any intermediate-frequency spread heavily toward label_0, that may cause misclassification. In this sample the early positive transient is small (favoring label_1) and intermediate-frequency energy is limited (STFT shows mostly low-frequency energy), so those label_0-like cues are weak.\\n- Conclusion of Step 2: the dominant trough+recovery pattern is shared (makes it a boundary case), but the small early bump and the low intermediate-frequency content reduce the support for label_0-specific distinguishing features. Therefore the sample is a boundary instance but more consistent with label_1 distinguishing cues.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching sample features to label summaries (without over-weighting boundary features):\\n- Label 1 canonical fingerprint (from provided summary): early small positive transient, pronounced low-frequency deep valley (~t12\u201336), smooth recovery crossing baseline to a positive hump/plateau, and optional late spike \u2014 with the model treating the deepest low-frequency valley + recovery as the strongest typical markers (red in heatmaps).\\n- Label 0 fingerprint: also can include trough+recovery and late peaks, but often emphasizes either a pronounced/sharp early positive transient and/or notable intermediate-frequency spread during transitions for some typical label_0 examples.\\n- Mapping: sample 82 matches label_1 strongly on four main points: (1) early transient is small (label_1-typical), (2) deep broad trough occurs in the label_1-expected time window and is dominated by low-frequency energy (a high-weight label_1 feature), (3) smooth recovery to low-frequency plateau (label_1-typical), (4) late spike is allowed/treated as typical in many label_1 examples. The STFT low-frequency dominance during trough and recovery is a decisive match to label_1's typical signature. The sample lacks a strong early sharp spike or broad intermediate-frequency jitter that would favor label_0, so those potential label_0 cues are weak and should not be used as primary evidence.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Consideration of other assistants' analyses and the black-box model result:\\n- All three independent assistants concluded label 1 with high similarity (score 4) and gave near-identical feature descriptions matching the ones above. Their consensus supports label 1.\\n- Black-box model prediction: label 1. Logits provided are [-0.05234825611114502, 1.5403223037719727]. Converting to softmax: approx probability for label 0 \u2248 0.17, label 1 \u2248 0.83 \u2014 the model assigns substantially higher probability to label 1. This aligns with the feature-based assessment.\\n- Classification accuracy meta-data: label 0: 0.9167, label 1: 0.8906 \u2014 both classes have similar overall accuracy on the dataset, indicating some chance of boundary confusion; however here both the black-box and human analyses agree on label 1.\\n- Alternative possibility: because label_0 and label_1 share the central trough+recovery morphology, a classifier that overly weights small early spikes or small intermediate-frequency components could decide label_0. Given the sample lacks strong such features, label_0 is a plausible alternative but less supported.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Final decision, reasoning summary, and verification:\\n- Final classification: label 1 (normal heartbeat). Primary reasons:\\n  1) The sample exhibits the canonical label_1 sequence described in the dataset documentation: small early bump \u2192 deep low-frequency trough in the expected time window \u2192 smooth low-frequency recovery to a positive plateau \u2192 late positive spike. \\n  2) STFT evidence: energy for the trough and recovery concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows (the label_1 'red' signature). There is minimal spread into intermediate/high frequencies (which would have supported label_0 in many references).\\n  3) Independent human analyses (three assistants) all concluded label 1 with high similarity, and the black-box model also predicts label 1 with ~0.83 probability \u2014 strong convergent evidence.\\n- Alternative (less likely) classification: label 0. Rationale for alternative: the central trough+recovery pattern is also present in many label_0 examples and some label_0 references visually resemble this sample; therefore a boundary misclassification is plausible if a model over-weights subtle early or transition features. However, those label_0 cues are weak here.\\n- Verification of compliance with the task requirements: I extracted explicit amplitude/time ranges, STFT frequency-concentration observations, assessed boundary-causing features and avoided using those ambiguous features as primary classification basis, compared the sample to both label summaries, incorporated other assistants' results and black-box output, and provided a final label with an explicit alternative.\\n\\nConclusion: classify Sample 82 as label 1 (normal heartbeat).\"\n  ]\n}"

The model\u2019s SHAP heatmap highlights the trough\u2019s low-frequency block as the major positively-weighted (red) region and marks only a small late intermediate-frequency patch as atypical (blue). Overall the dominant time\u2013frequency signature is low-frequency and strongly red in the trough window \u2014 a clear typical signature according to the heatmap.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Evaluate the black-box model's classification result and logits/confidence:\\n- The black-box model predicted label 1 with logits [-3.174499273300171, 2.976969003677368]. Converting to probabilities gives an overwhelmingly strong preference for label 1 (softmax P(label1) \u2248 0.998, P(label0) \u2248 0.002). The model is numerically highly confident.\\n- The SHAP heatmap supports this confidence: a large contiguous low-frequency red block during the trough (the strongest amplitude deviation) is exactly where the model places positive evidence for its prediction. The early transient and recovery are also red/light-red in low frequencies \u2014 additional supporting evidence. The blue atypical area is small and localized late at intermediate frequencies, not dominant.\\n- Therefore the model\u2019s high numeric confidence is consistent with the heatmap semantics: dominant typical features for label 1 are present and strongly weighted by the model. This is not a borderline pattern from the model\u2019s perspective.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Cross-check against label summaries and the three assistants' results:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 summaries describe a similar broad morphology (early bump \u2192 deep valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 plateau). That makes raw waveform morphology alone ambiguous between the two labels in some cases. The discriminator in the provided summaries and the SHAP-guided interpretation is where the model places importance in the time-frequency plane: label_1 canonical fingerprint focuses on the deep low-frequency trough (t\u224812\u201336) as the core typical marker; label_0 examples can also have those elements but often emphasize a particularly strong early sharp spike or include more intermediate-frequency spread during transitions or pronounced late spikes.\\n- In this sample the early positive transient is present (~+2.0) but the most decisive and dominant pattern is the broad, smooth deep trough with concentrated low-frequency energy and strongly red SHAP values \u2014 exactly the structure described as the canonical, most-typical evidence for label 1 in the provided summaries.\\n- The three assistants produced two independent label-1 assessments and one label-0 assessment. Weighing the evidence: the two label-1 analyses emphasized the SHAP heatmap\u2019s strong red trough block as decisive; the label-0 analysis argued the early sharp spike plus the full combination could match label-0 references. Given that the heatmap\u2019s strongest positive evidence is colocated with label-1\u2019s canonical low-frequency trough region, the balance of evidence (SHAP placement + STFT concentration + waveform) favors label 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final judgment about credibility and final classification:\\n- Credibility of the black-box model\u2019s label 1: high. The numeric logits show the model is highly confident, and the heatmap shows the model\u2019s confidence is grounded in a large, coherent, low-frequency region (the trough) that it treats as strongly typical (red). The small blue area at intermediate frequencies late is minor and insufficient to overturn the dominant red signature.\\n- Risk of misclassification / boundary status: Low. Although both classes share similar morphological building blocks, the classifier\u2019s explanation (SHAP heatmap) gives consistent, dominant positive evidence for label 1; this makes the sample a typical label-1 instance from the model\u2019s perspective rather than a boundary example. The lone label-0 assistant shows reasonable alternative reasoning (noted similarities), but it did not identify any strong intermediate-frequency or atypical features that would contradict the strong red trough evidence.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1 (normal heartbeat). The black-box prediction of label 1 is credible and well-supported by the heatmap (dominant low-frequency red trough), the STFT (energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows during the trough), and the line plot morphology (broad smooth deep trough + recovery + sustained plateau). The model\u2019s large logit gap corroborates the high confidence shown by the explanation heatmap.\"\n  ]\n}"

Manifestation: large, brief early positive spike with sharp flanks.  \\n  - Early\u2011mid stage (t \u2248 8\u201330): a prolonged broad negative valley/trough. Minimum amplitude \u2248 -2.0 to -2.2 around t\u224824\u201328; the trough is wide and smooth (low volatility).  \\n  - Mid stage (t \u2248 34\u201360): a recovery that crosses 0 around \u2248 t=38\u201340 and builds to a sustained positive hump/plateau with amplitudes ~0.6\u20131.1 (peaks near t\u224845\u201350). The hump is relatively smooth and persists many time steps.  \\n  - Late stage (t \u2248 60\u201395): mild decay from the mid hump back toward baseline, small fluctuations around 0 in the very late window (~80\u201395) \u2014 no very large late spike, only moderate bumps.\\n\\n- Time-frequency image (STFT):\\n  - Strong energy concentrated at the very-low-frequency row (0 Hz and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows) during the early\u2011mid trough window (roughly t\u224815\u201335) \u2014 consistent with a large slow deviation (deep trough).  \\n  - A distinct low-frequency energy band during the mid recovery/hump (t\u224840\u201360).  \\n  - Early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20136) also produces energy primarily in the low-frequency rows (the spike is brief but large). There is little wide-band high-frequency energy overall (no extensive high-frequency jitter), though small higher-frequency content appears late and is weak.\\n\\n- SHAP heatmap (contribution to classifier):\\n  - Very-low-frequency rows (0 Hz and adjacent lowest rows): strongly red in the time window covering the deep trough and the subsequent recovery (approx t\u224815\u201345). This indicates the model considers these low-frequency events in that time window as strongly typical for the predicted label.  \\n  - Early window (t\u22480\u20138): low-frequency components around the early spike show light\u2011to-moderate red (typical) contribution \u2014 i.e., the model treats the early positive transient as supportive.  \\n  - Mid-intermediate frequencies around late-mid times (approx t\u224860\u201380): small patches of light-blue (negative SHAP) that indicate some intermediate-frequency content in those windows is considered atypical or confusing for the label. Overall, the dominant pattern in the heatmap is red concentrated on the very-low-frequency rows across the trough & recovery intervals; only limited blue appears in intermediate frequencies and late windows.\\n\\n- Determination of per-feature typicality (by SHAP color mapping):\\n  - Early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20138): mostly red at the lowest frequencies \u2192 classified as a typical feature by the model.  \\n  - Broad deep negative trough (t\u22488\u201330): strongly red at the 0Hz/lowest-frequency rows \u2192 typical feature.  \\n  - Mid recovery / positive hump (t\u224834\u201360): red at lowest-frequency rows \u2192 typical feature.  \\n  - Late small fluctuations (t>70): weak/near-neutral to slight-blue at intermediate frequencies \u2192 minor atypical/ambiguous contributions.  \\n  - Higher-frequency jitter: largely absent; when present at late times it is light-blue/ambiguous \u2192 not considered typical.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Sample feature pattern (combination & phases):\\n- The sequence is: large early sharp positive transient \u2192 quick drop into a broad deep negative trough \u2192 smooth recovery crossing zero into a sustained positive mid-hump \u2192 slow decay to baseline with small late jitters.  \\n- Heatmap mapping to phases: the classifier marks the early spike and especially the trough + recovery as typical via red low-frequency SHAP values; only small, localized intermediate-frequency patches later are blue (atypical).  \\n- In short, the sample exhibits the classical pattern: early spike + deep, low-frequency trough + smooth low-frequency recovery hump. The classifier's heatmap treats the main low-frequency events (trough and recovery) as strongly typical and supportive of the label.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare to label feature sets and pattern lists:\\n- Both label 0 and label 1 reference descriptions include the canonical sequence: early positive transient \u2192 deep negative valley (~t\u22488\u201330) \u2192 recovery to positive hump (t\u224830\u201360) \u2192 late plateau/spike optional. For both labels the deep valley and recovery low-frequency energy are key typical features.  \\n- Distinguishing points in the provided summaries: label 0 emphasizes early sharp positive transient (t\u22648) and strong low-frequency trough + recovery as typical in several reference samples; label 1 also lists the deep valley as the primary canonical feature but in some label-1 samples there are occasional 0Hz blue anomalies or other ambiguous low-frequency cells.  \\n- For sample 89, the early sharp positive transient is large (+~3) and the heatmap marks both the early transient and the trough/recovery low-frequency components as red (typical). This combination (prominent early sharp positive transient + broad deep trough with strongly red low-frequency SHAP + typical mid recovery) corresponds very closely to the label-0 pattern descriptions (label_0 feature list explicitly notes early sharp positive transient as a typical signature when the 0\u2013low-frequency row is red, and the sample exhibits exactly that). While label 1 also shares many features, the SHAP here shows a particularly strong red signature tied to the early spike and trough in a way aligned with label 0 reference patterns.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples:\\n- Reference sample 1 (label 0, sample 35) shows a very similar morphology: an early large positive transient, a broad deep trough to \u2248 -2.0, and a smooth recovery hump with low-frequency red in the key windows. The sample 89 pattern is visually and time-frequency/SHAP-wise highly similar to that reference (timing of trough & recovery, magnitudes, and red low-frequency SHAP alignment).  \\n- Reference sample 2 (label 1, sample 66) is also similar in morphology; however, in the label-1 summaries some samples (and their SHAP) show either smaller early spikes or occasional 0Hz blue artifacts around the trough in some cases. Sample 89's heatmap does not show such confusing 0Hz blue artifacts in the main trough window \u2014 instead it shows clear low-frequency red \u2014 which aligns it more with the label-0 references.\\n\\nSimilarity scoring justification (final comparative quantification):\\n- Label 0: High similarity (4 points). Rationale: sample 89 matches the main label-0 fingerprint strongly \u2014 a large early sharp positive transient, a broad low-frequency deep trough, and a smooth recovery hump \u2014 and the heatmap marks these low-frequency regions as typical (red). Visual/time-frequency/SHAP alignment with label-0 reference sample 35 is strong (>80% of main features match).  \\n- Label 1: Moderate similarity (3 points, noted here for transparency). Rationale: many key morphological features (trough + recovery) are shared with label 1 and are typical there as well, so there is significant overlap; nonetheless the particularly strong early sharp spike + the clear red low-frequency signature for early spike + trough favors label 0 over label 1.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 (myocardial infarction event). The model-relevant evidence is the presence of a large early sharp positive transient and a broad deep low-frequency trough followed by a smooth low-frequency recovery \u2014 and all these main events are marked red (typical) in the SHAP heatmap for this sample, matching the label-0 canonical pattern and reference sample 35 very closely.\"\n    ]\n}",

Both labels therefore share the main slow low-frequency pattern. Key distinguishing clues in the documentation were how the model treats certain frequency components as typical vs atypical across the labels:\\n  - For label_1 the canonical hallmark described is the deep low-frequency valley (~t=12\u201336) with strong red in the 0Hz band and recovery to a positive plateau; late-stage spikes can also be typical in some label-1 samples.\\n  - For label_0 descriptions the model also considered early sharp positive transient + deep trough + mid recovery as typical when their energy is concentrated at the lowest frequencies, and intermediate-frequency jitter during transitions was often treated as atypical.\\n\\n- Which label matches more closely? Sample 89 matches the label_1 canonical fingerprint extremely well: strong red at the 0Hz band over the deep valley window, a smooth recovery that becomes a sustained positive plateau, and a modest early positive transient. These are exactly the three main typical features highlighted in the label_1 aggregated pattern. The presence of some intermediate-frequency negative SHAP during the late plateau is not contradictory because both label summaries treat jitter/mid-frequency spread as ambiguous or atypical; it does not outweigh the strong low-frequency typical signals in the trough and recovery.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples:\\n\\n- Reference sample 2 (Sample 66, Label 1) is visually and spectrally very similar to Sample 89: both show the same early positive spike \u2192 deep broad trough \u2192 smooth recovery into a positive plateau pattern, and both have STFT energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows at the trough and recovery times. The SHAP patterns are also comparable \u2014 strong red low-frequency blocks at the trough and recovery windows. This high resemblance supports labeling Sample 89 as label 1.\\n\\n- Reference sample 1 (Sample 35, Label 0) also shares the generic valley\u2192recovery structure, but sample 35\u2019s later-time behavior and the exact SHAP emphasis differ subtly from Sample 89; the match to label 1 is closer, both in waveform timing of peak/trough and in the SHAP emphasis placement.\\n\\nSimilarity scoring justification (for chosen label_1):\\n- Number of main feature matches: early positive transient (match, typical), deep extended negative trough concentrated in low frequencies (strong match, strongly typical), smooth recovery to a sustained positive plateau (match, typical). These are the primary features used by the model according to the heatmap and the label_1 description. The only minor discrepancy is small intermediate-frequency blue patches in the late plateau (acknowledged as typical/expected ambiguity). \\n- Conformity: >80% of label_1\u2019s main features are present and marked typical by the SHAP heatmap. Therefore the similarity is high -> score 4.\\n\\nFinal decision summary:\\n- Predicted label: label 1 (normal heartbeat pattern as defined in the reference list).\\n- Rationale: Sample 89 contains the canonical sequence (early brief positive transient \u2192 strong broad negative trough with concentrated low-frequency energy \u2192 smooth recovery to a sustained positive plateau), and the SHAP heatmap marks the trough and recovery low-frequency components as strongly typical (red). This pattern closely matches the label_1 pattern and matches the provided label_1 reference sample (Sample 66). The minor intermediate-frequency blue patches during late plateau are small and do not contradict the dominant label_1 indicators.\\n\\n(End of analysis.)\"\n    ]\n}",

Logits: [-3.2644529342651367, 3.981354236602783]. Converting logits to probabilities via softmax gives an overwhelmingly large probability for label 1 (exp(3.981) >> exp(\u22123.264)), i.e. model probability for label 1 \u2248 0.9993 and for label 0 \u2248 0.0007. This is a very large margin in logit space and indicates the model itself is highly confident in label 1.\\n- Heatmap corroboration: the SHAP heatmap shows broad, strong red concentrated in the very-low-frequency rows during the trough and recovery windows \u2014 the same time/frequency regions that are the principal distinguishing features in the supplied label summaries. According to the rules, predominant red in these key regions signifies the model regards these features as typical for the predicted label.\\n- Atypical/confusing signals: only small, localized blue patches appear in intermediate frequencies later in time. They do not dominate any of the principal event windows (early spike, trough, or recovery). Per the decision rules, the presence of a few blue patches in minor late/intermediate-frequency regions indicates minor ambiguity but not strong confusion.\\n- Conclusion on confidence and boundary status: the combination of (a) very large probability margin in logits and (b) SHAP heatmap dominated by red in the diagnostically important low-frequency trough-and-recovery regions indicates the model is confident and that this is not primarily a boundary case. The sample is therefore likely a typical example (from the model\u2019s perspective) of the label it predicted rather than a marginal/ambiguous case.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare against label feature summaries and the three assistants\u2019 classifications, and pick most reasonable final label:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 descriptions share the core morphological sequence: early positive transient \u2192 broad deep trough \u2192 recovery to a positive hump/plateau. This makes raw waveform morphology alone ambiguous between labels when considered out of context.\\n- Differences in the provided summaries that help discriminate:\\n  - Label_1 summaries emphasize that the deep low-frequency trough (\u2248t=12\u201336) and its low-frequency signature are the canonical, strongly typical markers, with recovery to a plateau also marked typical; some label_1 reference samples include late spikes but not always.\\n  - Label_0 summaries also list early sharp positive transients + broad trough + recovery as typical in several samples, but they often note intermediate-frequency jitter or distinctive late spikes in some reference examples as distinguishing behaviors. Label_0 descriptions sometimes highlight that intermediate-frequency spread during transitions can be atypical/ambiguous.\\n- For this sample:\\n  - The heatmap strongly highlights 0Hz/low-frequency energy in the trough and recovery windows (red), exactly the hallmark called out as the main typical fingerprint for label_1 in the reference summaries.\\n  - The early spike is present and low-frequency-red as well \u2014 supportive but not uniquely decisive (both labels can show it).\\n  - The small intermediate-frequency blue patches are limited and late; they do not flip the overall evidence.\\n- Three assistants\u2019 votes: two assistants concluded label 1 (both gave strong rationale about the low-frequency trough+recovery being typical for label 1), and one assistant concluded label 0 (justifying via similarity to some label_0 examples). The assistant majority and the model\u2019s own strong confidence both favor label 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Verification and final decision:\\n- Re-check for overlooked cues that might favor label 0: label_0 would be more plausible if there were prominent intermediate-frequency spread, strong atypical blue in the 0Hz trough cells, or a late sharp spike characteristic of some label_0 examples. The SHAP does not show those patterns dominating \u2014 the trough 0Hz cells are red, not blue.\\n- The evidence (waveform, STFT, SHAP) consistently indicates the key diagnostic low-frequency trough and recovery are typical according to the model and align with the label_1 canonical fingerprint described in the dataset notes.\\n\\nFinal conclusion:\\n- The black-box model\u2019s classification (label 1) is credible and well supported: (1) the logits show a very strong margin in favor of label 1, (2) the SHAP heatmap is dominated by red in the principal low-frequency trough and recovery regions (typical features), and (3) only minor localized atypical intermediate-frequency contributions are present, insufficient to overturn the dominant evidence. Two of three external assistant analyses also supported label 1. Therefore the best final label is label 1 (normal heartbeat pattern).\"\n    ]\n}"

Peak amplitude \u2248 +2.5\u2013+2.8 at about t=2\u20134, then a rapid decline crossing baseline near t\u22488. Shape: sharp-ish rise and short-duration positive bump. Volatility: relatively smooth on the spike, no strong high-frequency jitter visible in the line plot.\\n- Early\u2013mid stage (t \u2248 8\u201328): a pronounced, broad negative valley. Minimum around t\u224826\u201328 with amplitude \u2248 -2.6 to -2.8. Morphology: broad trough with smooth descent, low high-frequency oscillation inside the trough.\\n- Mid stage / recovery (t \u2248 30\u201350): a relatively rapid recovery from trough that crosses y=0 around t\u224834\u201336 and settles into a sustained positive hump/plateau around 0.4\u20130.7. The recovery is fairly smooth with small local fluctuations but no large jitter.\\n- Late stage (t \u2248 70\u201380): a modest late positive bump centered \u2248t=75 with amplitude \u2248+0.6\u2013+0.8, followed by a gradual decay towards baseline and near-zero small fluctuations for t>80.\\n\\nTime\u2013frequency (STFT) image:\\n- Strong energy concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz row and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows) in the window roughly from t\u224815\u201334 (coincident with the deep negative trough). This is a pronounced low-frequency block (high magnitude) indicating that the trough is a slow, large-amplitude event.\\n- Moderate low-frequency energy again in the mid-late window (t\u224836\u201360) corresponding to the recovery and sustained hump.\\n- No wide spread of energy into high-frequency rows during the key trough or recovery windows \u2014 the energy is mostly concentrated in the very-low-frequency band (only limited spread into the adjacent low-frequency rows). Very little high-frequency energy overall, indicating low jitter.\\n\\nSHAP heatmap (model contribution):\\n- Very-low-frequency (0 Hz row and adjacent low-frequency rows) in the early-to-mid trough window (approx t\u224815\u201334) is strongly red \u2014 highest positive SHAP contributions in the sample. Interpretation: the model regards the low-frequency trough energy in that time window as a strongly typical feature for the predicted label.\\n- The low-frequency rows in the recovery/mid window (t\u224836\u201360) are also red to mildly red \u2014 considered typical (supportive) by the model for that region.\\n- The earliest positive transient (t\u22480\u20138) at the lowest-frequency rows shows some positive/red SHAP contribution as well, though less intense than the trough block; thus it is also treated as typical albeit not the single strongest contributor.\\n- Intermediate-frequency rows (mid frequencies) show mostly neutral to faint blue/white patches in various windows but no dominant blue signature overlapping the major trough and recovery events; this indicates that any higher-frequency content (jitter) is minimal and not strongly regarded as atypical.\\n\\nClassification-pertinent typing of each extracted feature (based on SHAP colors):\\n- Early positive transient (t\u22480\u20138): low-frequency contribution marked mildly red \u2192 typical feature for the model.\\n- Deep negative valley (t\u22488\u201328): very-strong red at lowest-frequency rows \u2192 strongly typical feature.\\n- Mid recovery / positive hump (t\u224834\u201360): low-frequency rows light-to-moderate red \u2192 typical feature.\\n- Late modest positive bump (t\u224870\u201380): the low-frequency component shows mild positive SHAP (light red) \u2192 treated as typical/ supportive (not strongly decisive).\\n- Intermediate/high-frequency content: largely neutral to faint-blue in some non-core regions \u2192 considered atypical/ambiguous but not dominant here.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern summary for Sample 90:\\n- Combined pattern (phase sequence): early short positive transient \u2192 large broad negative trough (dominant) \u2192 smooth recovery crossing baseline to form a sustained mid positive hump \u2192 mild late positive bump and return to baseline.\\n- Frequency decomposition & model interpretation: the dominant events (trough and recovery) are concentrated in the very-low-frequency band and are strongly marked red in the SHAP heatmap (typical features). The early spike and late bump also have low-frequency support and mild red markings (typical). There is minimal intermediate/high-frequency spread (so jitter is not a confounding atypical feature).\\n- Conclusion of Step 2: Sample 90 displays the canonical valley\u2192recovery morphology, with the deep low-frequency trough (t\u224815\u201334) being the single strongest typical signature according to the SHAP heatmap; early transient and mid recovery are supportive typical features.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match with label feature lists and patterns:\\n- The provided label summaries show both labels (label_0 and label_1) can display the sequence: early positive transient \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery to positive hump \u2192 late plateau/bump. The crucial discriminant in the summaries is how the model treats the low-frequency trough & recovery and the presence/interpretation of intermediate-frequency jitter or late large spikes.\\n- Label_1 summary emphasizes: the deep negative valley around ~t=12\u201336 concentrated in 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows is the primary canonical typical marker and is strongly red in SHAP in reference samples. Also, label_1 often has a smooth recovery crossing y=0 and a late-stage plateau or optional late spike that the model treats as typical.\\n- Sample 90's features align very closely with that canonical label_1 pattern: (1) a pronounced deep trough in the correct time window with strong low-frequency energy and very strong red SHAP contribution, (2) a smooth recovery crossing to a sustained positive hump with low-frequency red support, (3) an early small positive transient and a modest late bump that are also marked typical (light red) \u2014 all matching the label_1 pattern descriptions.\\n- Label_0 also contains examples with early spike + trough + recovery, but the label_0 summary notes occasional intermediate-frequency spread / jitter being atypical and sometimes stronger late spikes that have mixed frequency contributions. In Sample 90, there is little intermediate-frequency energy and no unusually sharp late spike; the strongest model signal is the low-frequency trough in the canonical trough time-window, which the label_1 summary explicitly highlights as the main typical fingerprint.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final scoring justification:\\n- Reference sample (Label 1, Sample 80) shows almost identical morphology to Sample 90: early positive transient, deep trough around the same time, recovery to plateau, and a late modest spike; its STFT and SHAP also show the deep trough energy concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows and red SHAP there. Sample 90's STFT and SHAP match this pattern closely.\\n- Reference sample (Label 0, Sample 57) also shares some morphological similarity (early spike + trough + recovery), but the label_0 examples in the summary often include stronger early spikes and sometimes more mixed intermediate-frequency contributions. The decisive evidence is the SHAP heatmap: Sample 90's strongest SHAP red is the low-frequency trough region in the canonical time-window that the label_1 description calls the primary identifying signature. The match to label_1's canonical marker is therefore stronger.\\n\\nSimilarity scoring (1\u20134 scale):\\n- Similarity to label 1: 4 (High similarity). Rationale: Sample 90 matches \u226580% of the main label_1 features: the deep low-frequency trough (strong red SHAP), smooth recovery crossing baseline to a sustained positive hump (red/typical), early positive transient and late small bump (both typical/light-red). Time-frequency and SHAP patterns closely mirror the provided label_1 reference.\\n- Similarity to label 0: 2 (Low similarity). Rationale: although morphological shape is similar in a broad sense (both labels can show spike\u2192trough\u2192recovery), the model's SHAP emphasis (very strong red in trough low-frequency rows in the canonical trough window) and the lack of intermediate-frequency atypical components or a pronounced late sharp spike make label_1 a better match; thus only limited overlap with label_0's more specific typical patterns.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1. The model-interpretation heatmap (SHAP) places the strongest positive contribution on the deep low-frequency trough in the canonical trough time-window (a primary typical marker for label 1). The rest of the waveform (early transient, recovery, small late bump) is supportive and also marked typical. Consequently, Sample 90 most closely matches the label_1 pattern.\"\n    ]\n}"

The trace rises from ~+1.0 to a peak \u2248+3.0 (steep rise and relatively rapid fall). In the STFT this window shows concentrated, strong low-frequency energy at the 0Hz / lowest-frequency row (high magnitude). Little intermediate/high-frequency spread is visible during this early spike (energy concentrated in lowest rows).\\n- Early-to-mid stage (t \u2248 9\u201340): After the early spike the signal falls through baseline and develops a broad, smooth negative trough. The trough minimum is around t\u224836\u201340 with amplitude \u2248 -1.7 to -2.0. Morphology is broad and smooth (low volatility), occupying many time steps rather than a narrow spike. STFT shows strong low-frequency energy aligned with this trough window (bright energy in the lowest frequency rows), with only weak/intermittent intermediate-frequency content.\\n- Mid recovery (t \u2248 40\u201360): Slow, steady recovery from the trough back to and across y=0. The ramp-up is smooth and the STFT shows continued low-frequency energy during this ramp; intermediate-frequency energy is minimal.\\n- Late stage (t \u2248 60\u201395): A sustained, moderate positive plateau/hump with amplitudes roughly 0.3\u20130.8 and modest small fluctuations (no very large late spike). STFT shows low-to-moderate low-frequency energy in this late window; there is no concentrated wide-band (intermediate/high frequency) energy indicating strong jitter. Overall volatility in the late plateau is low.\\n- Summary of spectral content: Dominant energy is in the lowest-frequency rows during the early spike, trough, and recovery windows. There is minimal intermediate-frequency spread (little jitter), and no late abrupt high-amplitude spike with broad frequency content.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern (phase-wise combination):\\n- Pattern sequence: (1) early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20138, large amplitude), (2) broad early-to-mid deep negative trough (t\u22489\u201340, smooth and large negative excursion), (3) smooth mid recovery crossing baseline (t\u224840\u201360), (4) sustained moderate positive plateau (t\u224860\u201395) with low volatility. Spectrogram confirms low-frequency dominance for the main events and absence of significant intermediate/high-frequency jitter or a late sharp spike. This is a canonical spike \u2192 trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 plateau morphology where the trough is broad and low-frequency-dominated.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison to provided label feature lists and initial similarity scoring:\\n- Label 0 (myocardial infarction event) features: described typical signature includes an early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20138), an early-to-mid broad deep negative trough (t\u22488\u201330+), a mid recovery positive hump, and sometimes a late plateau or secondary peak. Label-0 descriptions emphasize dominant low-frequency energy for these events and treat intermediate-frequency jitter as atypical. Sample 92 matches these main aspects closely: early sharp spike, broad deep trough, smooth recovery, late plateau, and strongest energy in the lowest-frequency rows. Initial similarity: high.\\n- Label 1 (normal heartbeat) features: also lists a similar sequence in many reference samples (early small positive transient \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery \u2192 late plateau/optional late spike). The major differences in the label-1 descriptions are that some label-1 reference examples include large late spikes (>3.0) and sometimes more intermediate-frequency components during late events; label-1 canonical emphasis is the deep low-frequency valley around t\u224812\u201336 as primary indicator. Sample 92 shares elements of this sequence (valley + recovery), so there is some similarity, but the early spike in 92 is particularly sharp and large and the sample lacks the large very-late spike or pronounced intermediate-frequency jitter that some label-1 examples show. Initial similarity: moderate-to-low.\\n- Numeric similarity (initial): label 0 = 4 (high similarity); label 1 = 2 (low similarity). These numeric assessments reflect how many and how closely the sample's main features match each label's typical features (4 = main features \u226580% matched; 2 = 1\u20132 weakly correlated matches, <50% conformity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and finalize classification:\\n- Comparison with the four similar reference samples (Samples 14, 6, 84, 85 \u2014 all labeled 0): Visual morphology and STFT patterns match very closely. All have the big early positive transient (t~0\u20138), broad deep trough in the early-mid portion (t~20\u201344) with amplitude near -2, smooth recovery crossing baseline around mid-late window, and a late moderate plateau around 0.3\u20130.8. Their STFTs also show concentrated low-frequency energy during the same windows. Sample 92 closely mirrors these features in timing, amplitude ranges and spectral concentration. This strongly supports label 0.\\n- Comparison with the two dissimilar reference samples (Samples 1 and 81 \u2014 both labeled 1): Those label-1 examples show different distinguishing elements (notably large late spikes and more intermediate-frequency energy in the later window, and different mid-phase shapes). Sample 92 does not show a strong late spike or broad intermediate-frequency spread; its late activity is a smooth plateau. The differences from these label-1 references reduce the probability of label 1.\\n- Consideration of ambiguous overlap: Both labels' feature lists admit a similar spike\u2192trough\u2192recovery sequence, and the model can confuse boundary cases. However, the decisive aspects here are (i) the very pronounced early sharp positive transient (large amplitude), (ii) the broad, smooth trough concentrated at low frequencies, and (iii) the absence of a large late spike or significant intermediate-frequency jitter \u2014 this combination matches the label-0 canonical description particularly well (label-0 references consistently show the same sequence and spectral signature).\\n\\nFinal decision and confidence scoring:\\n- Predicted label: label 0 (myocardial infarction event).\\n- Overall confidence / similarity score for the predicted label: 4 (high similarity). The sample matches the main label-0 features (early large sharp positive transient; broad low-frequency-dominated negative trough; smooth recovery to sustained positive plateau) in timing, amplitude range, morphology and spectrogram distribution \u2014 matching \u226580% of the label-0 typical features.\\n- For clarity, similarity to each label (explicit): label 0 = 4, label 1 = 2. Label 1 is not scored higher because the key distinguishing elements of some label-1 references (large late spike, more late intermediate-frequency energy) are absent in sample 92, while the early-large-spike + broad trough + low-frequency dominance are hallmarks of the label-0 examples supplied.\"\n    ]\n}",

This overlap is the main source of boundary ambiguity.\\n\\n- Potential misclassification triggers in this sample:\\n  1) The presence of a pronounced deep trough and smooth recovery (Phases B and C) is a strong feature used by both label descriptions; if the classifier weights the trough/recovery more heavily than the early spike amplitude/timing, it may be pulled toward label 1 as well.\\n  2) Late-time plateau morphology is present in both labels; absence of a discriminative late large spike (which appears in some label_1 references) removes a distinguishing marker and could make the sample appear more ambiguous.\\n\\n- Features that are NOT likely to cause misclassification here:\\n  - Intermediate/high-frequency jitter: the STFT shows minimal spread into intermediate frequencies, so jitter is not a confounder for this sample (it would cause atypical markings but it's weak here).\\n\\nStep 2 conclusion: The primary boundary/confusion factor is the shared deep trough + recovery motif (common to both labels). The distinguishing feature that reduces ambiguity for label_0 is the very large early sharp positive transient (Phase A) combined with the specific timing/amplitude profile that closely matches label_0 reference examples.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching extracted features with the provided label summaries (avoid treating ambiguous features as decisive):\\n\\n- Match to label_0 (myocardial infarction event) summary:\\n  - Label_0 typical features: early sharp positive transient at t\u22480\u20138 (often large amplitude), early-to-mid broad deep negative trough (dominant, low-frequency), mid recovery positive hump (t\u224830\u201360), and sometimes a late plateau/secondary peak. Label_0 examples emphasize strong energy in the lowest-frequency rows for these events and consider intermediate-frequency jitter atypical.\\n  - Correspondence: The sample displays all of these label_0 hallmark features: (i) a prominent early sharp spike (~+3.0 at t\u22485\u20137), (ii) a broad deep trough to \u2248-2.0 with concentrated low-frequency STFT energy, (iii) a smooth mid recovery crossing baseline near t\u224855\u201360, and (iv) a late plateau rather than a late spike. The STFT aligns with label_0's low-frequency-dominant heatmap signature.\\n  - Conclusion: strong alignment with label_0; most discriminative components (especially the early spike amplitude and timing + low-frequency trough) are consistent with label_0 typical patterns.\\n\\n- Match to label_1 (normal heartbeat) summary:\\n  - Label_1 typical features: early positive bump, deep negative valley (~t12\u201336) with low-frequency energy, recovery to positive hump/plateau, and sometimes a late large positive spike (in some examples). Label_1 similarly treats broad low-frequency valley and recovery as canonical.\\n  - Correspondence: The sample shares the deep trough + recovery + late plateau sequence, so there is nontrivial similarity to label_1. However, many label_1 reference examples emphasize either certain late-stage spikes or somewhat different early bump amplitudes/timings; the very large early spike in this sample is more characteristic of the label_0 references.\\n  - Conclusion: moderate alignment with label_1 due to the shared trough\u2192recovery motif, but weaker than alignment to label_0 because of differences in the early peak's magnitude/timing and the absence of some label_1-specific late features (e.g., a very large late spike).\\n\\n- Critical note per instructions: Do not treat the shared trough/recovery as sole decisive evidence because it is a cross-label commonality (a potential misclassification source). Instead give extra weight to discriminative features: the early sharp positive transient amplitude/timing and the STFT's concentrated low-frequency signature across early/trough/recovery windows \u2014 these favor label_0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Integrating other analysts' results and the black-box model output:\\n\\n- Other assistants' consensus: All three external assistants concluded label 0 with high similarity scores (each reported label 0 with high confidence, emphasizing the same distinguishing features: very large early spike, broad deep trough, low-frequency-dominated STFT, and smooth recovery/late plateau). Their independent analyses align closely with my extracted features and discriminative reasoning.\\n\\n- Black-box model result: The black-box predicted label 0 as well (logits [0.2352350950241089, -1.7448430061340332], predicted label 0). Reported classification accuracies for labels are high for both labels (label 0: 0.9167, label 1: 0.8906) indicating the model is generally effective and that this sample is not trivially ambiguous to the model. The model's logit signs indicate class 0 is favored.\\n\\n- Reconciliation: Both the model and the three assistants independently selected label 0; their reasoning matches the discriminative features I prioritized. The primary shared-trough feature could have supported label_1, but both the model and assistants emphasize the early large spike and the precise low-frequency energy distribution as decisive in favor of label_0.\\n\\nStep 4 conclusion (final classification and alternative):\\n- Final (most reasonable) classification: label 0. Rationale: The sample matches label_0's prototypical pattern in timing, amplitude, and frequency content \u2014 especially the very large early sharp positive transient (Phase A) plus broad, smooth low-frequency trough and smooth mid recovery crossing baseline near the same times that label_0 references do. STFT energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows during the early spike and trough strengthens the label_0 match. The presence of the trough and recovery alone is not decisive because that pattern is shared with label_1, but the additional discriminative features (large early spike magnitude and the match to label_0 reference timing/morphology) justify label_0.\\n\\n- Alternative (secondary plausible) classification: label 1 (moderate plausibility). Rationale: Because label_1's summary also contains a deep low-frequency valley and recovery (features present here), and because some label_1 examples share many morphological similarities, label_1 cannot be ruled out completely. However, it is the less likely label given the discriminative early-spike characteristic and STFT profile.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Final verification of reasoning and checking for potential oversight:\\n- Reviewed whether any discriminative features were ignored: The key discriminative feature is the large early spike (amplitude \u2248 +3.0) which strongly aligns with the label_0 reference set; I have repeatedly emphasized this and the STFT's low-frequency concentration. I have not relied solely on the trough/recovery pattern, which is shared between labels, in accordance with the instructions not to treat shared/misleading features as decisive.\\n- Confirmed STFT interpretation: high energy concentrated at 0Hz / lowest-frequency rows aligns with large, smooth deviations (early spike and broad trough) rather than jitter; intermediate- and high-frequency energy is minimal, so jitter-based atypicality is not a confounding factor here.\\n- Cross-checked consensus: Both model and three assistants predicted label 0; they used similar discriminative reasoning.\\n\\nFinal answer (after comprehensive verification):\\n- Primary predicted label: label 0 (myocardial infarction event).\\n- Secondary/alternative plausible label: label 1 (less likely, because of shared trough/recovery motif but lacking other label_1-specific late features).\\n\\nTherefore, based on (1) the extracted time-domain morphology (very large early spike, broad trough, smooth recovery, late plateau), (2) the STFT showing dominant low-frequency energy in the early/trough/recovery windows and little intermediate-frequency spread, (3) the match to label_0 reference patterns, (4) agreement among three other assistants and the black-box model, and (5) careful handling of shared features that could mislead classification, the most reasonable and best-supported classification for this sample is label 0.\"\n  ]\n}"

In Sample 93 the SHAP color for the 0 Hz mid-trough is dominantly red (i.e., the model treats that DC trough as typical/supporting for the chosen label).

Because the SHAP map here marks the core DC regions as red, the model is less likely to flip and misclassify than the worst-case boundary examples; nevertheless, the overall pattern is one commonly seen in label_0 samples that become borderline. For genuinely boundary label_0 instances in the provided set the black-box often produces logits near the decision boundary (logit difference around -1 to +1), and when the mid DC trough is flagged atypical the sign can flip (favoring label_1) producing a negative margin of magnitude ~1\u20132.

Potentially confusing elements present in the sample:\",\n    \"   - The pronounced early sharp positive transient plus a later distinct positive peak are features that appear in both labels' descriptions; if the classifier weights early spike prominence heavily, it may favor label_0 in some learned patterns.\",\n    \"   - The late sharp drop after the late peak is somewhat abrupt; abruptness can sometimes create higher-frequency components in real signals. However, in the STFT the intermediate-frequency energy is weak, so this is only a minor confusion factor.\",\n    \"3. Evidence that likely reduces misclassification risk:\",\n    \"   - Lack of broad intermediate-frequency spread (i.e., minimal jitter) reduces alignment with label_0's more ambiguous/atypical intermediate-frequency patterns that the summaries flagged as distinguishing for some label_0 examples.\",\n    \"4. Summary: the main source of ambiguity is the shared overall morphology (present in both labels). The STFT reduces ambiguity by showing dominant low-frequency energy which, per the provided label summaries, is a stronger canonical fingerprint of label_1 in this dataset. Thus the sample is a boundary case due to morphological overlap but leans toward label_1 because of its time-frequency signature.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching sample features to the label feature summaries and preliminary judgment (excluding misclassification-prone cues as primary evidence):\",\n    \"1. Match to label_1 (normal heartbeat) key points:\",\n    \"   - Early small/large positive transient: sample contains this (match).\",\n    \"   - Pronounced deep negative valley around t\u224812\u201336 with concentrated low-frequency energy: sample contains this with the STFT strongly showing low-frequency concentration (strong match and a decisive time-frequency signature for label_1 in the summaries).\",\n    \"   - Smooth recovery crossing baseline into a positive hump/plateau: sample contains this (match).\",\n    \"   - Late-stage small-to-moderate positive spike and optional sharp post-peak rebound: sample contains a moderate late spike and rebound; label_1 summaries show such late spikes can be typical in many label_1 examples (match).\",\n    \"   - Intermediate/high-frequency jitter is minimal in the sample (this is consistent with the label_1 typical pattern where jitter is treated as atypical).\",\n    \"   - Overall: high conformity with label_1 typical features, especially because the decisive, repeatedly emphasized marker in label_1 descriptions is the low-frequency-dominant deep trough during the early-mid window \u2014 present here.\",\n    \"2. Match to label_0 (myocardial infarction) key points:\",\n    \"   - Label_0 also lists early sharp positive transients, deep negative valleys, recovery humps, and sometimes late peaks\u2014so the morphological overlap is substantial (moderate match).\",\n    \"   - The label_0 summaries often call out intermediate-frequency spread/jitter or mixed-frequency anomalies during transitions as an atypical/ambiguous fingerprint in several label_0 examples. Our sample shows little of that (weak match).\",\n    \"   - Some label_0 references do have similar low-frequency-dominant patterns, so match is non-negligible; however, given the emphasis in the reference summaries that label_1's core discriminant is a strong low-frequency trough block while label_0 often has ambiguous intermediate-frequency contributions, the current sample aligns more cleanly with the label_1 fingerprint (preliminary judgment favors label_1).\",\n    \"3. Preliminary judgment (explicit): label_1 is the better match. Do not treat the mere presence of an early sharp spike or a late positive peak (features shared across labels) as the decisive basis, because those are misclassification-prone shared features. Instead, rely on the STFT low-frequency concentration in the trough and recovery windows as the decisive evidence \u2014 this strongly favors label_1.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Compare with other assistants' analyses and the black-box model output, then form final classification and an alternative:\",\n    \"1. Three assistants' conclusions: all three independently concluded label_1 with high similarity/confidence (score 4).

Interpretation: the model's logit for class 0 is marginally higher than for class 1 (less negative), producing a prediction of label 0. The margin is small (difference \u2248 0.1646), indicating low confidence / borderline decision. This supports the idea that the sample is a boundary case.\",\n    \"3. Why the black-box might predict label 0 despite spectral evidence for label_1:\",\n    \"   - Learned bias: the model may place extra weight on certain morphological cues present here (e.g., sharpness of the early transient, presence/shape of the late spike or the final rapid negative rebound) that in training correlated with label_0 in some examples, causing it to tip toward label_0 for borderline inputs.\",\n    \"   - Insensitivity to subtle STFT cues: the classifier may rely more on raw waveform shapes or learned filters that respond to spike amplitudes/ratios instead of the concentrated low-frequency block emphasized in the human-readable summaries. This can produce disagreement when the sample has features common to both labels but a spectral signature that humans deem diagnostic.\",\n    \"   - Small logit margin indicates the model was uncertain and near the decision boundary \u2014 consistent with human analysts\u2019 consensus for label_1 but model indecision.\",\n    \"4. Final classification decision and alternative:\",\n    \"   - Primary (final) result: label_1. Reasoning summary: the sample's dominant and diagnostically emphasized feature is a broad, deep trough in the early\u2013mid window with concentrated low-frequency energy in the STFT and a smooth recovery + plateau \u2014 this low-frequency trough + recovery is repeatedly marked in the provided label_1 feature list as the canonical hallmark of label_1. The line plot and STFT match label_1 strongly. Multiple independent human-analyst reviews reached label_1 with high confidence, reinforcing this conclusion.\",\n    \"   - Alternative result: label_0. Rationale for alternative: morphological overlap (early sharp spike, large trough, late peak) is substantial; the black-box predicted label_0 (though with a small margin). Because label_0 can show similar low-frequency patterns in some examples, label_0 remains a plausible alternative in a strict boundary-case sense.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 5 \u2014 Verification and final check for missed features or bias: ensure decisive cues were not ignored:\",\n    \"1. Re-check of decisive spectral cue: the STFT shows the brightest/strongest block in the lowest-frequency rows during the trough and continued low-frequency energy through recovery and late plateau \u2014 this characteristic was central to label_1 descriptions and is present here. No contradictory strong intermediate-frequency energy appears elsewhere that would reverse the match toward label_0.\",\n    \"2. Consideration of misclassification-prone cues: early sharp transient and late spike are shared by both classes and thus were deliberately downweighted in my decision rationale; the model probably relied on these shared cues more heavily. Because I explicitly avoided making those shared features decisive, the decision is robust to that misclassification risk.\",\n    \"3. Decision consistency: multiple independent human analyses and spectral evidence consistently favor label_1. The black-box's opposite prediction is consistent with a boundary-case misclassification (small logit margin), not definitive evidence that human-spectral interpretation is wrong.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Conclusion (final answer):\",\n    \"   - Most reasonable classification: label_1 (normal heartbeat) \u2014 primary result.\",\n    \"   - Alternate plausible classification: label_0 (myocardial infarction) \u2014 viable given morphological overlap and the black-box model's decision, but less supported when spectral concentration in the low-frequency trough is taken as decisive evidence.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Concise final statement: the sample is a boundary case because both labels share the broad spike\u2192trough\u2192recovery morphology, but the concentrated low-frequency energy during the deep trough and the smooth recovery/plateau pattern strongly favor label_1; the black-box predicted label_0 with a small margin, likely due to its reliance on shared morphological cues.\"\n  ]\n}"

Thus, superficially both labels can present similar gross morphology. The deciding differentiators from the provided summaries and the heatmap are the exact typicality markings (which frequency rows/time regions the model considers typical vs atypical).\\n- Key matches to label_1 (my reasoning):\\n  - The model's heatmap strongly marks the deep-negative trough low-frequency block (t\u224815\u201334) as typical (red). Label_1's summary repeatedly states that the deep negative valley localized in the 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows (time window ~12\u201336) is the primary canonical signature the model uses for label_1. This is an excellent match.\\n  - The recovery/hump (t\u224834\u201350) low-frequency red cells align with label_1's typical mid recovery feature (label_1 description: recovery crossing y=0 to a positive hump is typically low-frequency red). Another match.\\n  - The early positive transient shows mixed markings with a small absolute-0Hz blue cell (atypical) but adjacent low-frequency rows are red. Label_1's summary acknowledges that some samples show a blue spot at the absolute 0Hz row for the early transient (they explicitly cited Sample 2 as having a 0Hz blue at the early window) \u2014 thus the sample's early mixed marking maps well to known label_1 ambiguities. \\n  - The absence of a very large late spike and the presence instead of a modest plateau/slow decay fit label_1's common pattern (label_1 often shows a plateau or an optional late spike; here the optional spike is not present, which is acceptable for label_1).\\n- Contrasts with label_0: \\n  - Label_0 examples also show early spike + trough + recovery patterns and in some label_0 samples late spikes. But label_0 descriptions emphasize the early sharp positive transient being typically marked red in the lowest-frequency band for that label. In our sample, the absolute 0Hz early cell is blue (atypical) while only adjacent low-frequency rows are red, which maps less cleanly to the prototypical label_0 marking. \\n  - Additionally the strong central low-frequency red block is a stronger hallmark described in the label_1 summary (label_1 repeatedly described the deep valley at 0Hz as the primary canonical feature). While label_0 can have similar low-frequency valleys, the particular pattern of early absolute-0Hz atypicality combined with a dominant mid-trough 0Hz-red block is described in label_1's example samples. \\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and finalize classification decision:\\n- Reference sample 2 (Label 1, Sample 69) shows a very similar shape to the test sample: large early positive transient (to ~+3.3), a deep broad trough to ~-2.0, and a recovery to a positive plateau around 0.7\u20130.9. Its STFT and heatmap emphasize the deep trough low-frequency region as red/typical \u2014 very close to the test sample pattern and heatmap semantics. This strong similarity supports assigning label 1.\\n- Reference sample 1 (Label 0, Sample 56) also shares the valley\u2192recovery morphology but the overall heatmap emphasis and some temporal differences (and label_0 examples sometimes include a later large spike or different early 0Hz marking) make it a slightly less close match than Reference 2 for the test sample. The test sample's early slight absolute-0Hz blue and the dominant mid trough low-frequency red block align more closely with the label_1 reference examples.\\n- Final decision: label 1 (normal heartbeat). The classifier\u2019s SHAP heatmap signals that the most decisive, strongly red blocks correspond to the deep trough at low frequencies and the subsequent recovery \u2014 this is the canonical, model-favored pattern for label_1 in the supplied documentation and reference sample 2. The early small absolute-0Hz blue cell and the intermediate-frequency blue patches during the recovery are minor atypicalities but do not override the strong typical mid-trough signal.\\n\\nSimilarity scoring justification (quantitative):\\n- Similarity to label_1: 4 (High similarity). Rationale: the test sample matches the main canonical features for label_1 (>80% of the primary features): prominent deep low-frequency trough, recovery to positive hump, and supportive low-frequency energy in those windows. Heatmap typicality (strong red) during the trough/recovery is the decisive evidence. Early minor 0Hz atypicality and some intermediate-frequency jitter are known and documented label_1 ambiguities and do not contradict the overall match.\\n- Similarity to label_0: 2 (Low similarity). Rationale (not part of the primary output score but for transparency): although label_0 sometimes displays similar gross morphology, the test sample\u2019s heatmap markers (absolute early 0Hz blue + dominant mid trough red pattern) and the close resemblance to the provided label_1 reference mean the test sample is less consistent with the prototypical label_0 patterns.\\n\\nConclusion: The sample's combination of (1) a dominant low-frequency deep negative trough marked strongly red by the model and (2) a low-frequency recovery/hump marked red \u2014 together with the close match to the label_1 reference sample \u2014 indicates classification as label 1.

STFT: low-frequency energy is weaker than earlier; heatmap low-frequency cells in late-mid windows show light-red to neutral; some mid-frequency cells show slight blue around transition periods. Interpretation: late plateau is weakly-typical (supporting) while the small mid-frequency contributions (small blue patches) are treated as atypical/ambiguous.\\n- Intermediate/high-frequency jitter: Minor localized mid-frequency blue markings (notably around the transition into the mid/late interval) indicate small higher-frequency components are considered atypical or ambiguous by the model.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 concise feature pattern of the sample:\\n- Sequence: early sharp positive transient (t0\u20138, mostly typical) \u2192 broad deep negative trough (t8\u201332, strongly typical) \u2192 smooth recovery to a positive hump (t32\u201350, typical) \u2192 late low-amplitude plateau with slight negative drift and small jitters (t50\u201395, weakly typical / some atypical mid-frequency components).\\n- Frequency-wise: dominant low-frequency energy (0 Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows) during trough and recovery; heatmap marks these low-frequency regions red (typical) and marks some isolated mid-frequency strips blue (atypical). Overall the model\u2019s SHAP heatmap treats the core low-frequency trough+recovery sequence as the main typical signature for the predicted label and treats small higher-frequency jitters as atypical.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 match to provided label feature lists:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 descriptions share the canonical sequence early bump \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery hump \u2192 late plateau/spike. The distinguishing aspects: label_0 descriptions emphasize an early sharp positive transient + broad negative valley + mid recovery hump and often no very large late spike (or a smaller late plateau), while label_1 descriptions often include the canonical valley+recovery but in many reference label_1 samples a late large positive spike (t\u224885\u201392) is present and treated as typical for label_1 in those cases.\\n- The test sample matches the label_0 canonical pattern very closely: pronounced early sharp positive peak, broad deep trough dominated by low-frequency energy (strong red), smooth recovery hump dominated by low-frequency red, and the absence of a large late positive spike (instead there is a lower-amplitude late plateau). The heatmap on this sample highlights (in red) the exact low-frequency trough and recovery windows that are described as typical for label_0 in the feature summary.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 cross-check with provided reference samples and final decision:\\n- Reference sample 56 (label 0) is visually and frequency-wise highly similar: early positive spike, deep smooth trough to \u2248 \u22122, recovery hump to \u2248 +1, late modest plateau. The SHAP/time-frequency patterns line up closely with the test sample (dominant red in low-frequency trough and recovery). Reference sample 69 (label 1) also shows the valley\u2192recovery sequence but many label_1 examples often include a more pronounced late positive spike which is absent in the test sample.\\n- Given the very close match of the main features (early spike + deep low-frequency trough + smooth low-frequency recovery + no large late spike), and the heatmap marking of those low-frequency trough/recovery regions as strongly typical (red), the sample best matches label 0 (myocardial-infarction-style pattern in the provided descriptions).\\n\\nSimilarity/confidence scoring rationale: I give the assigned label (label 0) a score of 4 \u2014 high similarity. Rationale: the major, decisive features (\u226580%) listed for label 0 \u2014 early sharp positive transient, broad deep trough with strong low-frequency energy, and smooth recovery hump \u2014 are all present and marked as typical by the heatmap. By contrast, while label 1 shares several features, the absence of a characteristic large late positive spike and the stronger correspondence to the label 0 reference sample make label 0 the best match.\"\n    ]\n}"

Morphology: a short-duration sharp spike with steep flanks.\\n  - Early-to-mid trough (t \u2248 8\u201334): a broad, smooth negative valley that reaches about \u22122.0 (deepest near t\u224826\u201330). Morphology: wide, low-volatility trough (slow descent and slow recovery), occupying many time steps.\\n  - Mid recovery/hump (t \u2248 34\u201350): a relatively rapid ascent crossing y=0 and producing a sustained positive hump/plateau with amplitude \u2248 +0.8\u20131.0 around t\u224840\u201345.\\n  - Late stage (t \u2248 50\u201395): gradual decay from the mid hump into a low-amplitude plateau and slight negative drift late (small fluctuations around 0, no very large late spike >+3).\\n- Time-frequency image (STFT):\\n  - Strong energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows (0 Hz row and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows) during the deep-trough time window (~t 12\u201334) and during the recovery (~t 34\u201350).\\n  - The early spike produces low-frequency energy but with less exclusive concentration in the absolute 0Hz row than the trough window (energy present in low-frequency neighbors as well).\\n  - Little energy spread into high frequencies overall; only modest intermediate-frequency energy during some transition windows (i.e., limited jitter content).\\n- SHAP heatmap (typicality / contribution):\\n  - Dominant red block at the lowest-frequency rows centered on the mid trough and the recovery window (roughly t\u224815\u201350). Interpretation: the model treats this mid trough + recovery low-frequency energy as strongly typical evidence for the predicted label.\\n  - Early-time columns (t\u22480\u20138): adjacent low-frequency rows show light-to-moderate red, but the absolute 0Hz cell in the very early column shows a small blue patch. Interpretation: the early spike has mixed marking \u2014 largely supported by low-frequency neighbors but with an atypical signal at the single 0Hz cell.\\n  - Small blue (negative SHAP) patches appear in an intermediate-frequency row during the mid/late transition (~f\u22480.18\u20130.25, t\u224850\u201370). Interpretation: the model regards that intermediate-frequency content (some localized jitter) as atypical/confusing.\\n  - Late-time low-frequency cells are near-neutral to light-red (weakly supportive), consistent with a late plateau rather than a pronounced late spike.\\n- Summary of classification-relevant feature labels (typical/atypical/ambiguous):\\n  - Deep negative trough (t\u224812\u201334) in 0Hz + adjacent low-frequency rows: strongly typical (red) \u2014 high positive evidence.\\n  - Mid recovery/hump (t\u224834\u201350) in low-frequency rows: typical (red) \u2014 supporting evidence.\\n  - Early sharp positive transient (t\u22480\u20138): ambiguous \u2014 adjacent low-frequency rows moderately typical but the absolute 0Hz cell is slightly atypical (blue). Overall: mixed/partly-typical but not uniformly typical.\\n  - Intermediate-frequency jitter during transition (~t\u224850\u201370): atypical (blue) but small in magnitude compared with the mid-trough/red block.\\n  - Late plateau (t>60): weakly-typical or neutral (light red / near-zero SHAP).\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Evaluate the black-box model's prediction & logits/confidence:\\n- Provided logits: [-3.2489, 3.7860]. Converting to probabilities (softmax) yields an overwhelming probability for label 1 (exp(3.786)/[exp(3.786)+exp(-3.249)] \u2248 >0.99). The model is numerically highly confident for label 1.\\n- Does the heatmap support that confidence? Yes: the SHAP heatmap shows a large, contiguous red low-frequency block over the trough + recovery windows \u2014 these are exactly the time/frequency regions the model uses as decisive, and red dominance in that block indicates typical features for the predicted label. Although there are small blue patches (an early 0Hz cell and a narrow intermediate-frequency region during transition), they are limited in extent and magnitude compared with the strong red block.\\n- Conclusion about model confidence & boundary status: the model's logit gap is large and the heatmap contains a dominant typical (red) low-frequency region corresponding to the deepest trough and recovery. That pattern gives strong, consistent evidence in favor of the predicted class. The small atypical marks indicate minor ambiguous components but do not overturn the main evidence. Thus the sample is not a strong boundary case \u2014 the black-box model's prediction is well supported by its own SHAP map and the signal's dominant low-frequency morphology.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Compare to label summaries and other assistants' analyses:\\n- Both labels' summaries describe a common gross morphology (early positive transient \u2192 deep negative valley \u2192 recovery hump \u2192 late plateau/spike). The decisive discriminators in the documentation were which time-frequency components the model marks as typical vs atypical (particularly whether the early spike is strongly typical in the absolute 0Hz row).\\n- Label-specific mapping from the summaries:\\n  - Label 1 canonical emphasis: deep valley (0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows) in ~t12\u201336 marked strongly red; recovery also low-frequency red. Early spike can be present, and label-1 samples sometimes show the early 0Hz cell as a small blue (documented ambiguity).\\n  - Label 0 canonical emphasis: early sharp positive transient is often a strongly typical low-frequency event (red at earliest low-frequency rows) combined with trough+recovery. Label-0 summaries typically show the early spike strongly red in 0Hz rows for many examples.\\n- Match to this sample: the strongest red block in this sample is the trough + recovery at low frequencies \u2014 that aligns with label 1's primary canonical fingerprint. The early spike here has a mixed signature: adjacent low-frequency rows red but the absolute 0Hz cell slightly blue \u2014 this mixed early marking maps more naturally to documented label-1 ambiguities (label-1 examples were explicitly noted to sometimes show a blue 0Hz cell early). If the early 0Hz cell had been strongly red, the sample could more strongly favor label 0; instead the split marking reduces support for label 0.\\n- Cross-checking the three assistants: two independent assistants concluded label 1 with high similarity scores; one assistant favored label 0 citing similarity of early spike + trough + recovery. Given the heatmap's specific pattern (dominant mid-trough low-frequency red + early absolute-0Hz blue), the balance of evidence supports label 1 as the better match. The black-box model also predicted label 1 with large margin.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Final verification and judgement:\\n- Weighing all evidence: (a) the black-box model's logits indicate a very high probability for label 1; (b) SHAP heatmap shows a dominant red low-frequency block over the trough and recovery (strongly typical per the model); (c) the early spike is mixed/ambiguous in the heatmap (small blue at 0Hz) which reduces support for label 0; (d) intermediate-frequency blue patches are minor and localized; (e) two out of three assistants independently judged label 1 and their rationales match the same decisive features.\\n- Decision: classify as label 1. Rationale summary: the decisive, model-emphasized features (deep trough and recovery concentrated in the 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows) are strongly typical according to the SHAP heatmap and match the label-1 canonical signature in the provided summaries. The model's large positive logit for label 1 is consistent with this SHAP evidence. Minor atypical markings do not outweigh the strong typical block, so this is not primarily a boundary/uncertain case.\\n- Final confidence judgement: the black-box model's prediction is credible and supported by the heatmap; final classification = label 1.\"\n    ]\n}"

Little spread into high frequencies. \\n  - SHAP heatmap: The 0 Hz row and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows over this trough time block are strongly red (high positive SHAP). Interpretation: the deep negative trough is treated as a strongly typical feature by the model (typical, dominant low-frequency). \\n\\n- Recovery / mid-to-late stage (t \u2248 36\u201360):\\n  - Line: Smooth recovery crossing baseline around t\u224840\u201346 and rising into a sustained positive hump/plateau, amplitude roughly 0.3\u20130.9 initially and then increasing later. The ramp is relatively smooth (low volatility). \\n  - STFT: Low-frequency energy during the ramp and plateau; some mild intermediate-frequency energy in transition points but not dominant. \\n  - SHAP heatmap: Low-frequency rows over the recovery / hump interval show red/pale-red shading (typical). Some sparse blue/nearneutral markings appear at a few intermediate-frequency rows during the steeper portions of the ramp (indicating minor ambiguous/atypical oscillatory contribution), but the main low-frequency contribution remains red. Interpretation: recovery/hump is a typical feature in its low-frequency components; any small mid-frequency jitter is ambiguous/weakly atypical.\\n\\n- Late stage (t \u2248 60\u201395):\\n  - Line: A moderate late positive hump/peak centered \u2248 t=70\u201376 with amplitude \u2248 1.0\u20131.3, then decline toward baseline with small jitters near the end.

There is little-to-no strong blue in the late low-frequency rows. Some intermediate-frequency cells in transition windows show faint blue/neutral \u2014 those are ambiguous but minor.

Overall these are minor compared to dominant low-frequency red blocks.\\n\\nSummary of feature-typicality decisions (per heatmap):\\n- Early sharp positive transient (low-frequency components): typical (red) .\\n- Deep broad negative trough (low-frequency): strongly typical (red).\\n- Recovery to positive hump (low-frequency): typical (red); small intermediate-frequency transition components: ambiguous/weakly atypical (blue/neutral). \\n- Late moderate positive hump/plateau (low-frequency): typical (pale red). \\n- Short intermediate-frequency jitter during some transitions: atypical/ambiguous (blue patches) but minor relative to main low-frequency features.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Feature pattern of sample 99 (combination & phases):\\n- Pattern sequence: Early large positive transient (t\u22480\u20138, typical low-freq) \u2192 Deep broad negative trough (t\u224810\u201336, strongly typical low-freq) \u2192 Smooth recovery crossing baseline and sustained positive hump (t\u224836\u201360, typical low-freq with minor ambiguous intermediate-frequency content during transitions) \u2192 Moderate late positive hump/plateau (t\u224860\u201380, typical low-freq) \u2192 return to baseline with small jitters (t>80, largely neutral/weak). \\n- Dominant time-frequency signature: strong concentration of energy and model-attributed importance (red) on the lowest-frequency rows during the trough and during the recovery/hump windows. Intermediate-frequency contributions are limited and sometimes flagged as slightly atypical, but they are not dominant.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature lists/patterns:\\n- Label 1 canonical fingerprint (from provided summary): early small positive transient \u2192 pronounced low-frequency deep valley (~t12\u201336) \u2192 recovery crossing baseline to positive hump (~t36\u201355) \u2192 late-stage plateau or optional late spike; model treats deep-valley low-frequency block as the principal typical marker for label 1.\\n- Label 0 summary: also often shows early sharp positive transient \u2192 broad deep negative trough \u2192 mid recovery hump and sometimes late secondary peak. Many label 0 reference examples show similar low-frequency red marking for the early spike and trough.\\n\\nComparison and reasoning: sample 99 exhibits the full canonical sequence emphasized for label 1: distinct early positive transient, a pronounced broad deep low-frequency trough exactly in the mid-interval, and a smooth recovery crossing into a sustained positive hump and a moderate late hump. The SHAP heatmap in sample 99 specifically marks the trough and the recovery/hump low-frequency rows as red (the characteristic sign the model uses to identify label 1 in the provided label_1 descriptions). While label 0 can show a very similar set of events, the reference label-1 sample (Reference sample 2) shows a near-identical morphology and similar placement/amplitude of the late hump and the smooth recovery; sample 99's mid and late amplitudes and the absence of an extremely abrupt large late spike align more closely with the label-1 reference than with label-0 reference sample 1 (which shows a stronger distinct late spike near the end). Crucially, the model's SHAP marks in sample 99 emphasize the deep trough's low-frequency block as strongly typical (red), which the label_1 description identifies as the main canonical indicator of label 1. Therefore the pattern in sample 99 matches the label 1 canonical pattern with high fidelity.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and scoring:\\n- Reference sample 2 (label 1) similarity: morphology is highly similar \u2014 early positive transient, pronounced trough to \u2248-2, smooth recovery to a positive plateau and then a gradual decline. STFT/heatmap patterns (dominant low-frequency energy in trough and recovery colored red) are closely aligned. => Strong match.\\n- Reference sample 1 (label 0) similarity: also shares many elements (early spike, trough, recovery), but differs in the presence/timing/amplitude of late very-large spikes in the label-0 reference and in some of the higher-frequency transition content. Sample 99's later hump is moderate and the trough/recovery sequence matches the label-1 canonical description more directly.\\n\\nAssigned similarity score (1\u20134) for the chosen label (label 1): 4 (High similarity). Rationale: the major characteristic features enumerated for label 1 (early positive transient, a dominant broad low-frequency deep valley in the mid-interval, and subsequent smooth recovery into a positive hump/plateau with low-frequency SHAP red markings) are present and marked as typical by the model's SHAP heatmap. Over 80% of the key label-1 features match in both time, amplitude behavior and heatmap coloration; minor intermediate-frequency blue patches (atypical) are present but do not outweigh the dominant low-frequency typical features.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1.\"\n    ]\n}",

This is not a marginal/borderline logit; the model is confidently favoring label 1.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Cross-check with label summaries and the three assistants' analyses:\\n- Both label_0 and label_1 descriptions note the sequence early positive transient \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery; the distinguishing emphasis in the provided summaries is that label_1 strongly uses the deep low-frequency mid-trough (\u2248t12\u201336) as its principal canonical marker (very-red in many reference SHAP examples). Label_0 examples sometimes emphasize different timing or very-large late spikes in some samples.\\n- The test sample's most prominent SHAP and STFT signatures align with the label_1 canonical fingerprint: a broad, smooth, deep trough centered near t\u224830 with concentrated low-frequency energy and very-strong red SHAP values, plus supporting early and recovery low-frequency red. The three other assistants all concluded label 1 (two with high similarity scores and one with moderate similarity), which matches this interpretation.\\n- Potential ambiguity: both labels can present similar morphological sequences; however the decisive evidence here is the dominant, very-red low-frequency trough block that matches label_1's primary identifier in the summary. The limited blue at intermediate frequencies is insufficient to overturn that match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Final assessment and decision whether this is a boundary sample:\\n- The model's high predicted probability for label 1 is justified by the heatmap: large coherent red regions correspond to the main diagnostic event (broad trough) and supporting events (early transient and recovery). The presence of small blue patches during transitions introduces only minor ambiguity.\\n- Therefore the sample is not a borderline case likely to be misclassified; it is a typical example supporting label 1 according to both the SHAP explanation and the time-frequency energy distribution.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1 (normal heartbeat). Justification: concordant evidence from the line plot, STFT, SHAP heatmap (dominant red low-frequency trough), the black-box model's high-confidence logits (p\u22480.99 for label 1), and independent analyses by the three assistants all indicate label 1 is the most reasonable classification.\"\n    ]\n}"
