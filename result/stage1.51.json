                "Negative baseline with small high-frequency jitter (start and end segments). Manifestation: relatively steady negative offset values that differ by sample: Sample 1 baseline ~ -0.6, Sample 2 baseline ~ -1.2, Sample 3 baseline ~ -0.3, Sample 4 baseline just below/around 0.0. Shape/stability: long duration, low-amplitude periodic micro-oscillations (visible as thin sawtooth-like jitter in line plots). Time-frequency: low-frequency/near-0Hz energy present during baseline (strongest at the 0Hz row in STFT). Heatmap color mapping: early/late baseline often shows positive contribution (red) in the 0Hz row for some samples (e.g., Sample 2 early baseline strongly red at 0Hz), but in samples where an elevated event occurs later the 0Hz row during that time can turn blue (inhibitory). Summary: baseline DC at 0Hz is often informative; red at 0Hz indicates the baseline value range is typical for the label, blue at 0Hz indicates that DC level at that time is inhibitory.",
                "Sustained elevated plateau with oscillation (mid segment). Manifestation: abrupt rise from negative baseline to positive plateau that persists over many time steps (e.g., Sample 1 from ~260–520 at values ~1.2–2.1, Sample 2 from ~300–end around 0.6–0.9). Shape/rate: almost step-like onset and step-like offset, inside plateau there are regular oscillatory pulses (visible as repetitive peaks/valleys). Time-frequency: high-energy regions concentrated at non-zero frequency rows (example bands around 0.18–0.2 and 0.38–0.40 in Sample 1 STFT), plus some energy in 0Hz due to mean shift. Heatmap mapping (apply rule to ignore 0Hz for oscillating components): the non-zero frequency rows (above 0Hz) are marked red (typical) for these oscillatory plateaus, while the 0Hz row during these oscillations may be blue or mixed — per rule, for oscillating peaks/plateaus ignore 0Hz and treat the upper-frequency red as the true typical feature. Thus oscillatory plateau frequency components are typical features (red) while DC component may be inhibitory (blue) in the same time region.",
                "Sharp transient positive spike (short impulse). Manifestation: very short-duration large amplitude spike (Sample 4 around time ~240–260 amplitude up to ~8–9). Rate/shape: steep rise and fall in a narrow time window (impulsive). Time-frequency: broadband energy with strong concentration at very low frequencies/0Hz (because of large DC transient) and spill into adjacent low-frequency rows. Heatmap mapping: low-frequency and 0Hz rows at the spike time are strongly red (typical). Because this spike is largely DC-like (large amplitude), 0Hz contribution is representative and is marked red.",
                "Small later burst of high-frequency oscillation (short periodic burst). Manifestation: small-amplitude, short-duration repeated pulses located late in the sequence (e.g., Sample 4 around ~620–660, Sample 2 small transient near ~650). Shape: high-rate oscillation with modest amplitude. Time-frequency: energy concentrated in small non-zero frequency rows, little DC. Heatmap mapping: in examples these late high-frequency bursts are often marked blue at the relevant non-zero frequency rows or show weak/neutral SHAP — indicating that such small oscillatory bursts are atypical/inhibitory for the label in those samples.",
                "Transient strong DC plateau (large positive non-oscillatory lift). Manifestation: larger slow-moving positive plateau with modest jitter (e.g., Sample 3 between ~560–630 with values ~3–4). Time-frequency: dominant energy at 0Hz (DC) with relatively little spread into higher frequency rows. Heatmap mapping: 0Hz row at that time is red (typical) indicating that a large steady positive DC-level in that time window is a positive/typical feature for the label.",
                "Isolated sudden step-change with little oscillation at onset (pure DC step). Manifestation: abrupt step from baseline to a new mean without pronounced oscillatory jitter (seen in Sample 2 initial step to ~0.8). Time-frequency: energy concentrated at 0Hz (DC) at the moment and some transient spread. Heatmap mapping: often the 0Hz row is blue after the step in some samples (inhibitory) if the model prefers earlier baseline DC ranges (indicating different numerical DC ranges map to red vs blue). This demonstrates that different numerical baseline/plateau ranges map to different SHAP signs: e.g., baseline range [-1.3 to -1.0] (Sample 2 early) is red/typical, while plateau DC range [~0.6–0.9] can be blue/inhibitory in some samples.",
                "Frequency-dispersed jitter inside plateaus. Manifestation: when the plateau shows jitter/irregular oscillation, the STFT displays energy spread across multiple adjacent non-zero frequency rows (broader frequency band). Heatmap mapping: these dispersed non-zero frequency rows are red (typical) when plateaus are characteristic, but the 0Hz row should be ignored for fluctuating features (per rule) because 0Hz represents steady components not fluctuations."

The plateau contains clear oscillations whose energy lies in non-zero frequency bands (~0.18 and ~0.38 Hz) which are marked red in the heatmap (typical). The 0Hz row during the oscillatory plateau is mixed/blue (inhibitory) — per rule we ignore 0Hz and consider the adjacent upper-frequency red as the true contributing feature.",
                "Sample 2 pattern: Long early negative baseline (~ -1.2) with small jitter (strong red at 0Hz indicating that baseline DC range is typical) + sharp upward step to a positive plateau (~0.6–0.9) that contains regular oscillations (non-zero frequency energy). The heatmap shows early 0Hz red (typical baseline) but during the mid/late plateau the 0Hz row becomes blue (inhibitory) while non-zero frequency rows for oscillation may be weak — also a short late transient spike (~650) appears with some red at 0Hz. Interpretation: baseline DC in [-1.3,-1.0] is typical (red), while the mid-plateau DC and/or its DC component is inhibitory (blue); oscillatory frequency components may still be informative.",
                "Sample 3 pattern: Negative baseline (~ -0.3) with jitter (low-level 0Hz energy) + late large steady positive plateau (560–630) with high amplitude (~3–4). This event is largely DC (dominant 0Hz energy) and the heatmap marks the 0Hz region red (typical). There is only minor higher-frequency spread; thus the model uses the DC-level of this late large pulse as a strong positive feature.",
                "Sample 4 pattern: Mostly near-zero baseline + a very short, high-amplitude impulse/spike (~8–9) around ~240–260 (sharp transient). STFT shows broadband/low-frequency concentration and the SHAP heatmap marks low/0Hz rows at spike time as red (typical). Later, a small moderate-amplitude high-frequency burst (~620–660) appears that is marked blue (inhibitory/atypical) in the non-zero frequency rows. Interpretation: sharp impulsive DC-like spikes are typical features (red at 0Hz), while late small oscillatory bursts are atypical/inhibitory."

Observed numerical ranges: about -0.70 to -0.75 (sample 2), about -0.40 to -0.50 (samples 1 and 3), and about -0.20 to -0.30 (sample 4). Heatmap mapping: when baseline is strongly negative (≈ -0.7 to -0.75) the SHAP heatmap shows negative (blue) contributions concentrated in the low-frequency/0Hz rows (sample 2) — baseline far below the label's preferred range is an inhibitory feature; when baseline is closer to zero (≈ -0.2 to -0.4) the low-frequency/0Hz rows are closer to neutral or slightly positive (white to light red in some samples) indicating that a less-negative baseline is more typical.",
                "Abrupt step-up to sustained positive plateau (manifestation B): a sudden, large upward jump (step) from negative baseline into a positive plateau that remains for an extended time. Observed amplitude ranges: modest plateau ≈ +1.0 to +1.6 (sample 2), large plateau ≈ +3.0 to +4.0 (samples 1 and 4). Time region: mid-recording (~time steps 400–520). Heatmap mapping: energy concentrated at very low frequencies (0Hz) at plateau times. The SHAP heatmaps typically show positive (red) values at the 0Hz/very-low-frequency row coinciding with plateau times — indicating that the presence of a sustained positive baseline/plateau in that amplitude range is a typical (supporting) feature for the label. (Note: if the plateau contains clear oscillations/jitter, see the separate jitter rule below.)",
                "High-amplitude transient peaks with jitter/oscillation on plateau (manifestation C): when the plateau or peak is not perfectly steady but shows high-frequency fluctuations / jitter superimposed on the elevated level. Time-frequency: STFT shows energy both at 0Hz and spread upward into adjacent nonzero frequency rows during the same time region. Heatmap mapping: per the analysis rule, we IGNORE the color in the 0Hz row for fluctuating peaks and focus on the adjacent upper-frequency rows. In multiple samples (1 and 3, and parts of 4) the upper-frequency rows above 0Hz show blue (negative) SHAP values while the 0Hz row can appear red — this indicates that the steady component of the plateau is supportive (0Hz red) but the oscillatory/jittering component (nonzero-frequency energy) is inhibitory (blue).",
                "Short isolated positive pulses (manifestation D): brief spikes or short-duration pockets of high positive value (narrow in time, abrupt onset and return to baseline). Observed in sample 3 as many short pulses (amplitude ~2.5–3.8) separated by baseline. Time-frequency: localized high energy at low frequencies and some energy into small adjacent frequency rows. Heatmap mapping: many of these pulses map to red (positive) SHAP values in the low-frequency/0Hz rows indicating they are typical contributors; however, pulses that show clear oscillatory content above 0Hz sometimes have mixed coloring with small blue at upper frequency rows, meaning the pure step/pulse is positive but superimposed jitter can reduce contribution.",
                "Stepped/gradual decline from plateau (manifestation E): the plateau falling back toward baseline in discrete steps or a descending trend with occasional small spikes. Observed in samples 1 and 4 (multi-step decay from a high plateau back down). Heatmap mapping: the 0Hz row around the descending times is often near-neutral to slightly positive (white to light red) — the return-to-baseline steady components are not strongly inhibitory, sometimes slightly supporting the label; small transient spikes during descent that are narrow/high-frequency often show blue in adjacent nonzero-frequency rows (inhibitory).",
                "Small periodic/regular oscillations near zero after event (manifestation F): low-amplitude rhythmic oscillations around the post-event baseline (samples 4 and 2 show small regular high-frequency toggles near the end). Time-frequency: energy concentrated at slightly higher nonzero-frequency rows. Heatmap mapping: these small higher-frequency oscillations map to blue (negative) SHAP values in the nonzero-frequency rows (inhibitory), whereas the steady low-frequency/0Hz contribution is neutral or weakly positive.",
                "Edge/transition sharpness (manifestation G): very fast rises or falls (large rate of change) at the moment of step transitions. Time-frequency: transient wide-band energy but dominated by low-frequency transient in STFT. Heatmap mapping: the 0Hz low-frequency row often shows slight positive (light red) contribution at the transition (the existence of the step itself is supportive), but any broad high-frequency energy during the edge that appears in rows above 0Hz tends to be blue (inhibitory)."

Each pulse: low-frequency/0Hz energy is typically red (supportive), while pulses that contain notable oscillation/jitter show blue in the adjacent nonzero-frequency rows (inhibitory for the oscillatory component).

According to the heatmaps: the steady component of that big transient (0Hz) is supporting (red) but the jitter/oscillation in the adjacent frequency rows is inhibitory (blue) + after the main event there are small periodic oscillations around baseline whose nonzero-frequency rows appear blue (inhibitory)."

                "Sample 204 pattern: Stable negative baseline ≈ -0.45 to -0.5 (inhibitory in low-frequency 0Hz rows in some samples) + abrupt large upward step into a high plateau ≈ +3.3–4.0 (0Hz row shows positive/typical) BUT plateau contains visible jitter (nonzero-frequency energy) — the nonzero-frequency rows are blue (oscillatory component inhibitory) + stepped decline back to baseline with small spikes (0Hz around decline neutral to slightly positive; spikes at nonzero frequencies slightly inhibitory).",
                "Sample 246 pattern: Strong negative baseline ≈ -0.75 (clear blue/inhibitory in 0Hz low-frequency rows) + abrupt rise later into a modest steady plateau ≈ +1.0–1.6 (0Hz shows red/typical supportive) + sustained jitter/oscillations on that plateau toward the end (nonzero-frequency rows show mixed or slightly blue contributions — jitter reduces support). The overall pattern is baseline far below ideal (inhibitory) + sustained positive plateau near mid-amplitude (typical).",
                "Sample 247 pattern: Baseline moderately negative ≈ -0.45 (near-neutral to slightly inhibitory) + multiple short isolated pulses (several narrow positive events of amplitude ~2.5–3.8). Each pulse: low-frequency/0Hz energy is typically red (supportive), while pulses that contain notable oscillation/jitter show blue in the adjacent nonzero-frequency rows (inhibitory for the oscillatory component). The pattern is: sequence of typical short pulses (0Hz red) with intermittent inhibitory high-frequency jitter (nonzero-frequency blue).",
                "Sample 220 pattern: Near-zero-to-slightly-negative baseline ≈ -0.2 (closer to neutral or weakly positive in 0Hz) + single large transient peak (very high amplitude up to ~7) with superimposed jitter (STFT energy at 0Hz and spread above). According to the heatmaps: the steady component of that big transient (0Hz) is supporting (red) but the jitter/oscillation in the adjacent frequency rows is inhibitory (blue) + after the main event there are small periodic oscillations around baseline whose nonzero-frequency rows appear blue (inhibitory)."
