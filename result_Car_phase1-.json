        "Observation (t \u2248 80\u2013140): the series falls from near 0 to a pronounced local trough around -1.15 to -1.25 (minimum at \u2248120). The descent is smooth and relatively slow (broad curvature) with small high-frequency ripples (tiny superposed wiggles) on the trough\u2019s flank. -> Implication: the model attributes this low-frequency, deep negative lobe (broad trough + fine jitter) positively (red at low frequency). That indicates the sedan class is associated with a large, smooth concave outline segment (low-frequency shape) plus small local detail at the trough.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 200\u2013300): the series rises from slightly negative/near-zero to a broad positive peak \u2248 +1.5\u20131.6 (peak centered \u2248270). The rise is steeper than the prior descent and the peak shows a short plateau with small rapid fluctuations (minor bumps) on top. -> Implication: low-frequency positive lobe and the short plateau at the crest strongly contribute to classification (SHAP red at bottom-frequency band here). The presence of a wide, high-amplitude convex segment with small top-of-crest wiggles is a discriminative sedan feature.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 340\u2013440): the series transitions from positive through zero to the global trough near -1.7 (deepest value at \u2248420). This fall is the steepest in the record and the trough is narrower and slightly sharper than the first trough, again with micro-fluctuations on its flanks. -> Implication: the deep, low-frequency negative lobe (especially its near-zero-to-trough slope and depth) is a primary positive contributor to the sedan label (strong SHAP red at low frequency around this time). The model favors this pronounced low-frequency valley as evidence.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 500\u2013576): the series climbs from negative/near-zero up to a final positive plateau \u2248 +1.5\u20131.65 with a fairly steady slope; small local bumps appear on the rising flank and near the late peak. -> Implication: sustained low-frequency upward trend and terminal high-amplitude peak contribute positively (SHAP red near end). The endpoint positive lobe reinforces the overall low-frequency envelope pattern the classifier expects for sedans.",
        "Observation (frequency domain): STFT shows the signal energy concentrated at the lowest frequencies (bottom rows) throughout the timeline; occasional minor increases in very-low-frequency energy align with the same time windows as SHAP red regions. Very little mid/high-frequency energy is present except for weak bursts at extrema. -> Implication: the classifier relies mainly on low-frequency (long-period) shape features \u2014 the broad lobes and their timing \u2014 rather than high-frequency texture. Small high-frequency ripples at extrema provide secondary cues.",
        "Observation (local substructure): at each major extremum there are small-scale oscillations (tiny zigzags) visible in the time plot and as small high-frequency components in the STFT; SHAP shows positive attribution mainly at the low-frequency band but also modest positive mass where those small ripples appear. -> Implication: the classifier uses coarse outline (low-frequency envelope) as primary evidence and uses the micro-fluctuations at extrema as supportive fine-grained features for distinguishing sedan from other vehicle types.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 150\u2013210): The SHAP heatmap shows a strong red cluster concentrated at the lowest frequency band between roughly time steps 150 and 210. In the raw signal this interval corresponds to a smooth, sustained upward swing: values move from about -1.1 (near the trough) through zero to roughly +0.2. The rise is gradual (no sharp spikes), with small superimposed micro\u2011ripples but low short\u2011term volatility. -> Implication: The classifier attributes positive evidence for the 'sedan' class to this low\u2011frequency, steady upward trend \u2014 i.e. a slow DC/low\u2011frequency transition from negative to positive amplitude is an informative signature for this label.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 200\u2013280): There is continued positive SHAP support extending into the interval ~200\u2013280 where the series climbs to and briefly plateaus at a local maximum around +1.3 to +1.6. The shape is a rounded peak (not a sharp spike) with very low high\u2011frequency content and only slight jitter on top of the plateau. -> Implication: A sustained positive plateau / rounded peak at low frequency is further evidence the model uses; persistent high amplitude in the positive direction (stable, low volatility peak) increases probability of the sample being labeled as a sedan.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 300\u2013360): A secondary red region in the SHAP heatmap (lowest freq row) aligns with the later portion of the positive peak and the start of the downward slope. The signal in this window sits at elevated values (~+1.4 to +1.6) and shows a gentle downturn after the plateau, again with low volatility. -> Implication: The model also rewards the persistence of that positive, slowly changing structure; the timing and duration of the high plateau and its subsequent slow descent are considered characteristic of the target class.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 80\u2013130): The earlier trough (around time steps 80\u2013130) is deep (\u2248 -1.0 to -1.2) and fairly smooth, with a short, slightly noisy bottom (small local micro\u2011fluctuations visible as tiny wiggles). The STFT shows minimal high\u2011frequency energy here but clear low\u2011frequency content. -> Implication: Deep, smooth negative troughs followed by a steady recovery appear to be part of the same slow oscillatory pattern that the model exploits; the trough + gradual recovery sequence contributes indirectly to the positive classification through the subsequent upward transition.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 380\u2013440): The second major trough is deeper (\u2248 -1.6 to -1.85) and longer in duration than the first trough. That downward swing is smooth but reaches a larger negative amplitude and takes longer to reverse. SHAP here is weak/neutral to slightly negative (pale blue patches), i.e., this deep trough is not strongly positively attributed. -> Implication: The model seems to prefer the presence of the positive plateau and the preceding upward transition more than extreme negative excursions; deep long troughs are either neutral or slightly reduce the classifier confidence for this label.",
        "Observation (microstructure across the series): Small, high\u2011frequency ripples appear throughout (most visible at peaks and trough bottoms) \u2014 low amplitude, short duration oscillations superimposed on the dominant slow wave. STFT shows these as very faint higher frequency bins, while the SHAP heatmap is mostly blank for those frequencies. -> Implication: These micro\u2011ripples are likely noise or minor outline detail; they have little positive SHAP weight and do not drive the sedan classification strongly.",
        "Observation (frequency-domain): The STFT image shows almost all measurable energy concentrated at the lowest frequency band (near 0.0 on the frequency axis), with occasional low\u2011frequency bursts aligned with the SHAP red windows; there is negligible energy above the lowest bins. -> Implication: The classifier relies predominantly on very low\u2011frequency / slowly varying components (the gross shape of the outline over hundreds of time steps) rather than on higher frequency features to identify this sample as a sedan.",
        "Observation (temporal dependence): Positive attribution (red) in SHAP is concentrated at slow upward transitions and sustained positive plateaus; negative attributions (blue) are scattered during long negative valleys and some small short windows. The positive windows are separated in time by the slow oscillatory cycle (roughly two main cycles across 577 steps). -> Implication: The model\u2019s decision uses temporal context \u2014 it rewards the sequence of trough \u2192 steady rise \u2192 positive plateau as a coherent pattern. Isolated instantaneous values are less important than these structured, time\u2011extended events."

        "The feature pattern of Sample 0 is: Dominant low-frequency oscillation (global waveform) with period ~250\u2013300 time steps producing successive lobes: 1) First negative lobe (t \u2248 80\u2013140) broad trough \u2248 -1.2 with small local jitter; 2) First major positive lobe (t \u2248 200\u2013300) broad peak \u2248 +1.5\u20131.6 with a short plateau and micro-fluctuations; 3) Deep central/trailing negative lobe (t \u2248 340\u2013440) sharpest and deepest trough \u2248 -1.7; 4) Final positive rise and plateau (t \u2248 500\u2013576) returning to \u2248 +1.6. These low-frequency lobes are the dominant structure (STFT energy concentrated at near-zero frequency). Volatility is low overall (smooth curves) with localized small high-frequency ripples at extrema. Time-series dependence: large-scale envelope is periodic/oscillatory (two long cycles across the sequence) with asymmetric slopes between rises and falls (some descents steeper than rises). The classifier\u2019s attribution (SHAP) focuses on the low-frequency energy at the times of these lobes (especially troughs and peaks), implying the model uses the shape, amplitude and timing of these broad outline segments \u2014 plus minor high-frequency detail at extrema \u2014 to decide the sample is a sedan.",
        "Overall pattern of Sample 42: A dominant slow oscillatory waveform with roughly two full cycles over 577 time steps. Manifestations: (1) Cycle 1: initial high value (~+1.6) \u2192 smooth decline to trough (~ -1.1) by ~100\u2013130 \u2192 steady rise and crossing of zero around 200 \u2192 rounded positive peak (~+1.3 to +1.6) around 260\u2013300. (2) Cycle 2: slow decline to a deeper trough (~ -1.6 to -1.85) around 410\u2013430 \u2192 final steady rise to ~+1.5 at the series end. The waveform is low\u2011frequency dominated (STFT energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin) and is generally smooth with small, low\u2011amplitude high\u2011frequency ripples superimposed. Volatility is low during plateaus/peaks and trough bottoms, higher only at gradual transition flanks. Temporal dependence: the classifier favors the specific temporal sequence trough \u2192 slow upward transition \u2192 sustained positive plateau (positive SHAP concentrated on these low\u2011frequency segments at t \u2248 150\u2013280 and t \u2248 300\u2013360), while long, deep negative valleys contribute neutral or slightly negative evidence.",
        "How these combine to support the label (sedan): The model appears to key on very-low-frequency morphological features \u2014 specifically the presence, timing and duration of smooth upward transitions and sustained positive plateaus within the slow oscillatory cycle. Those features (occurring ~150\u2013360 and again in the latter part of the series) are the most positively attributed by SHAP and thus form the basis for classification as label 0 (sedan)."

      "feature": [
        "Observation: Strong positive SHAP cluster centered ~t=160\u2013220 at the lowest frequency band. On the time plot this corresponds to the interval from about step 150 to 220 where the series moves from a local trough (\u2248 -1.2 to -1.3) into a sustained upward ramp ending near +0.0 to +0.6. The change is composed of a clear inflection and a steady positive slope with small superimposed ripples. -> Implication: The model attributes the upward inflection and ensuing low-frequency rise in that window as a positive cue for the pickup label. This feature is a low-frequency, moderate-amplitude recovery (peak-to-local-trough ~1.8\u20132.0 overall when combined with surrounding context) with limited high-frequency volatility, indicating a slow body-motion signature the classifier finds discriminative.",
        "Observation: From t\u2248200 to t\u2248280 the signal has a sharp, sustained rise from roughly -1.2 up to a local maximum \u2248 +1.6. Average slope \u2248 +0.035 units/step, with small high-frequency bumps (short-period fluctuations of small amplitude) layered on top of the rise. STFT shows increased low-frequency energy during this rise. -> Implication: The pronounced, relatively fast low-frequency ascent is a distinct substructure (deep trough \u2192 sharp crest) that the classifier uses as a positive indicator. The combination of high magnitude change and low-frequency content suggests a major vehicle silhouette change (e.g., a frontal/shape transition typical of pickups in the dataset).",
        "Observation: A concentrated red SHAP patch is also visible near t\u2248470\u2013520 at low frequency. On the time trace this maps to the final recovery segment (\u2248 t=420 to 576) where the signal climbs from the global trough (\u2248 -1.7 at ~420) back up to \u2248 +1.5 at the end, with a small dip/plateau around t\u2248520. The rise from trough to end is \u223c3.2 units over ~156 steps (avg slope \u2248 +0.0205). -> Implication: The classifier gives positive attribution to the long, low-frequency recovery late in the sequence. This sustained, large amplitude rebound (global trough \u2192 final high) appears to be another hallmark the model associates with the pickup class \u2014 a broad slow oscillation rather than short, noisy wiggles.",
        "Observation: Early segment t\u22480\u2013120 shows a monotonic decline from \u2248+1.55 down to \u2248 -0.8 with local smaller dips around t\u224880\u2013120 (small bulges and micro-fluctuations). STFT and SHAP show only weak low-frequency energy and only faint positive attribution in parts of this interval. -> Implication: The initial monotonic descent is part of the larger slow oscillation but is less discriminative on its own. Its presence provides context (starting high then falling) that amplifies the later trough\u2192rise transitions which the classifier finds more informative.",
        "Observation: The deepest trough occurs near t\u2248420 at approximately -1.6 to -1.7 and is wide (sustained negative values across ~t=370\u2013450) with a smooth concave bottom and minimal high-frequency noise. -> Implication: The broad, deep trough is a stable low-frequency feature that, when followed by a long recovery, strengthens the pickup attribution. The model likely leverages the trough depth and width (large negative excursion) combined with subsequent recovery as a discriminative motion pattern.",
        "Observation: Small-scale oscillatory substructure: around the trough-to-rise transitions (both near t\u2248150\u2013220 and t\u2248420\u2013576) there are short, low-amplitude bumps and tiny local maxima/minima (visible as small jagged deviations). STFT shows these are minor and concentrated at the very lowest frequency bins (i.e., slow variations), not broad high-frequency bands. -> Implication: These micro-fluctuations modulate the main slow trends and may help timing alignment for the classifier (providing additional localized shape cues), but the principal signal comes from low-frequency trend shapes.",
        "Observation: Relative rates of change differ across major segments: initial descent (t\u22480\u2013150) is moderate negative slope (~ -0.016\u2013 -0.02 units/step), the ascent to the mid-peak (t\u2248200\u2013280) is the steepest positive slope (~ +0.035 units/step), the fall to the global trough (t\u2248280\u2013420) is again steep negative (~ -0.0236 units/step). -> Implication: The asymmetry in slope magnitudes (a relatively sharper mid-rise followed by a deeper but somewhat slower decline) yields a characteristic asymmetric oscillatory cycle. The classifier appears sensitive to these slope patterns (steep ascent vs. broad deep descent) when identifying pickups.",
        "Observation: STFT (time-frequency) image shows almost all signal energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin(s) across the whole sequence with occasional low-frequency power increases around the times of the major rises (\u2248 t=200\u2013280) and deep trough (\u2248 t=370\u2013420). There is no sustained high-frequency band activity. -> Implication: The discriminative features are predominantly slow, large-scale shape changes (very low-frequency components). The classifier\u2019s SHAP heatmap correctly localizes importance to these low-frequency events rather than transient high-frequency noise.",
        "Observation: SHAP shows few blue (negative) contributions and the main red (positive) patches align with the two upward recoveries and the midrise. -> Implication: The model strongly favors presence of those low-frequency upward transitions as evidence towards label 1 (pickup); absence or inversion of those transitions would likely reduce pickup probability.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 157\u2013209): A pronounced, long-duration negative excursion (deep trough) centered around t \u2248 175\u2013190 with minimum value \u2248 -1.5 to -1.7. The trough spans roughly 40\u201360 time steps, has a smooth curved bottom with small superimposed high-frequency jitter (\u00b10.02\u20130.06), and is preceded by a sustained downward slope and followed by a relatively rapid upward slope. -> Implication: The model attributes strong positive evidence (red in SHAP) to this low-frequency, large-amplitude valley. This indicates the classifier relies on an extended negative half-wave (its amplitude, width and curvature) as a distinguishing low-frequency feature for the pickup class.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 210\u2013320): A strong recovery/positive rebound immediately after the trough rising from \u2248 -1.6 up to a local peak \u2248 +1.4\u20131.5 around t \u2248 300\u2013320. The rise is steeper than the preceding descent (higher rate of change), and the rising limb contains small plateau-like substructure around t \u2248 270\u2013300 (minor local dips and bumps). -> Implication: The paired pattern of a deep trough followed by a relatively rapid, high-amplitude rebound (negative-to-positive half-cycle) forms a half-cycle oscillatory signature that the model uses as further positive evidence for label 1. The shape asymmetry (slower descent, faster ascent) is likely informative.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u2013120): A long, gradual decline from an initial high (\u2248 +1.6 at t\u22480) toward zero and into negative values. The slope is moderate and relatively smooth with small, low-amplitude fluctuations superimposed. -> Implication: This long-run downward trend provides contextual baseline that leads into the pronounced mid-sequence trough; as a contextual low-frequency trend it helps the model recognize the overall waveform phase and reinforces attribution to the trough/rebound event.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 400\u2013480): A second prominent negative excursion (another deep trough) reaching \u2248 -1.4 to -1.55 around t \u2248 450 with a similar width (\u2248 40\u201360 steps) and then rising afterward. In the SHAP map this later trough shows little or slightly negative contribution (blue tint near t\u2248470). -> Implication: Although morphologically similar to the earlier trough, the model gives less positive (or slightly negative) attribution to this second trough \u2014 indicating the classifier is sensitive to the timing/location of the trough in the cycle (the earlier trough is more diagnostic for the pickup label than the later one).",
        "Observation (micro-structure across series): Small high-frequency jitter (short spikes/bulges of amplitude \u00b10.01\u20130.06) are visible on top of the dominant slow waveform, especially near inflection points (just before the trough bottom and near peak). STFT shows most energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bands, with minor power across slightly higher but still low frequencies. -> Implication: The classifier relies mainly on low-frequency, long-duration waveform shapes (large half-waves) rather than on transient high-frequency noise. The small jitter is likely not a primary driver of the pickup classification but may slightly modulate attribution at inflection points.",
        "Observation (frequency-domain corroboration): The STFT shows dominant energy at very low frequencies (closest to 0 Hz) across the whole sequence with localized increases in magnitude aligned with the large amplitude half-cycles (not distinct high-frequency bands). -> Implication: The features the model uses are long-duration (low-frequency) components \u2014 amplitude and phase of slow oscillations \u2014 consistent with the SHAP emphasis on the low-frequency rows. The positive SHAP region aligns with a time window where low-frequency magnitude increases, confirming attribution to large-scale shape rather than transient frequency events.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u201360): The series begins at a high positive value (~+1.5) and shows a steady monotonic decrease to around 0, with a moderate slope and low short-term volatility. -> Implication: An initial high baseline followed by a smooth downward drift indicates a slow, low-frequency change in the silhouette/motion at the start of the recording; this low-frequency component contributes weakly but consistently to the class score (small positive SHAP near the start in the bottom frequency band of the STFT).",
        "Observation (t \u2248 60\u2013140): The signal continues downward into a local negative trough around \u22121.1 to \u22121.3 with small superimposed high-frequency jitter (small ripples on the trough). The descent into the trough is reasonably gradual (~several tens of time steps) and the trough is somewhat flattened rather than a sharp spike. -> Implication: A broad negative excursion with small local fluctuations suggests a sustained change in outline (e.g., body-mid section) rather than a brief artifact; the low-frequency energy during this trough is visible in the STFT bottom band and corresponds to modest SHAP activity (mixed small red/blue), so this region partially informs but does not dominate the pickup classification.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 150\u2013270): A pronounced, relatively rapid ascent from about \u22120.9 up to a local peak near +1.6\u2013+1.7 occurs between ~180 and ~270, with the steepest slope roughly centered around ~230\u2013270. The rise contains small stepped substructure near the peak (tiny oscillations/plateaus around the maximum). -> Implication: This strong low-frequency upward swing with a sharp rising edge increases low-frequency STFT magnitude and corresponds to positive SHAP contributions in adjacent time windows; this upward transition likely encodes a salient morphological change that the model associates positively with the pickup class.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 270\u2013418): Following the peak, there is a long, smooth decline from +1.6 down to the global minimum near \u22121.7 at \u2248418. The fall is relatively steady but accelerates approaching the trough; there are small higher-frequency perturbations superimposed, particularly between 300\u2013360 (minor ripples). -> Implication: A deep, broad negative excursion (largest amplitude in the sample) concentrates energy in the lowest STFT frequency bin and is reflected in mixed SHAP influence (some small negative SHAP around the descending phase), indicating the trough itself is an important discriminative event \u2014 its depth and the slope into it are informative for classification.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 418\u2013475): The region highlighted strongly in red on the SHAP heatmap corresponds to a sharp, sustained upward recovery starting at the global trough (~\u22121.7 at 418) and crossing zero around ~470, continuing to reach positive territory (~+1.0 by ~500). This recovery has a relatively high rate of change (steep slope) and limited high-frequency noise \u2014 mostly a smooth low-frequency ramp with a short sharper inflection about midway. STFT shows increased low-frequency magnitude here (bottom rows) aligned with the red SHAP band. -> Implication: The rapid rebound from the deepest trough is a major positive contributor to the pickup classification (high positive SHAP). It likely encodes a distinctive silhouette/motion transition (e.g., sudden change in outline height/profile) that the model uses as a strong indicator for label 1.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 500\u2013523): A brief local dip occurs just after the major rising segment: amplitude drops from ~+1.0 to ~+0.6 (a small trough) between ~500\u2013523, then quickly recovers. This dip is short duration (\u224820\u201330 time steps) and higher-frequency relative to the larger waves. -> Implication: The short post-recovery dip introduces higher-frequency content in the STFT (small increase in middle/lower bins) and corresponds to localized negative SHAP patches; it acts as a minor counter-indicator but is outweighed by the strong positive effect of the prior recovery.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 523\u2013576): From ~523 to the end the signal climbs again and then plateaus in the positive range (~+1.4\u2013+1.5) with very low volatility (flat top). -> Implication: A final sustained positive plateau (low-frequency DC-like component) consolidates the positive evidence; STFT shows persistent low-frequency energy and SHAP shows smaller positive contributions here, reinforcing the classification contributed by the earlier rebound.",
        "Observation (Frequency content overall): The STFT is dominated by the lowest frequency band (near 0 Hz) across most time windows; there is minimal high-frequency energy except for brief ripples at transition points. -> Implication: The classifier relies mainly on slow morphological / shape changes (large-scale oscillations) rather than high-frequency texture \u2014 the red SHAP energy aligns with bottom-frequency bins, confirming slow transitions (especially the trough-to-peak rebound) are the discriminative cues for label 1."

        "Overall feature pattern of Sample 2 (label 1 - pickup):",
        "Feature A (initial high then monotonic decline) (t\u22480\u2013150): The sequence begins at a relatively high normalized value (\u2248+1.55) and decreases steadily to around -0.8. This sets a baseline slow downward trend with small local fluctuations\u2014providing context for later large excursions.",
        "Feature B (local trough and low-frequency recovery) (t\u2248150\u2013220): A localized trough near -1.2 followed by a clear low-frequency inflection and upward ramp. This interval carries strong positive attribution (SHAP) and represents a discriminative slow recovery substructure.",
        "Feature C (sharp low-frequency ascent to mid-peak) (t\u2248200\u2013280): A pronounced rise from trough to a local maximum \u2248+1.6. This is the steepest increase in the sequence (largest average slope) and is accompanied by increased low-frequency energy in the STFT\u2014another strongly-weighted cue for the model.",
        "Feature D (pronounced descent to global trough) (t\u2248280\u2013420): After the mid-peak the signal descends to the global minimum \u2248-1.6 to -1.7. The trough is broad and smooth (low volatility), producing a deep negative excursion that forms the nadir of the main oscillation.",
        "Feature E (long recovery to final high) (t\u2248420\u2013576): A sustained, low-frequency recovery from the global trough back to \u2248+1.5 at the end. This long rebound carries positive SHAP attribution and mirrors Feature B/C at a larger scale.",
        "Temporal dependence and combination: The sample shows a slow, multi-stage oscillatory pattern (down \u2192 up \u2192 down \u2192 up) dominated by very low-frequency components. The classifier emphasizes the timing and shape of transitions (especially trough\u2192rise events) rather than short-lived noise. The mid-sequence steep ascent and the final broad recovery together (both large amplitude, low-frequency sign changes) form the core discriminative pattern that the model maps to the pickup class.",
        "Overall feature pattern for Sample 4 (Label 1 - pickup): A slow, large-amplitude oscillatory waveform dominated by low-frequency half-cycles. Sequence structure: (1) Initial high plateau and gradual decline (t \u2248 0\u2013120) that establishes a downward phase; (2) A diagnostic deep trough (t \u2248 157\u2013209) with large negative amplitude (\u2248 -1.6), smooth curved bottom and small local jitter; (3) A relatively fast, high-amplitude rebound to a local positive peak (t \u2248 210\u2013320, peak \u2248 +1.4\u20131.5) with slight plateau/bump substructure on the rising limb; (4) A later second trough (t \u2248 400\u2013480) of similar amplitude but weaker positive attribution; (5) Low overall volatility aside from small superimposed high-frequency jitter at inflection points. Time dependence: the sample exhibits clear long-range dependence (slow half-wave cycles) where the timing and amplitude of the mid-sequence trough + rebound pair form the primary discriminative pattern. The STFT confirms the dominance of very low-frequency energy, and SHAP shows the model mainly uses the early-to-mid trough region (low-frequency, large-amplitude shape) to classify this sample as a pickup.",
        "The feature pattern of Sample 43 is: Long-period biphasic waveform + sharp recovery: (0\u201360) initial high baseline with smooth decline; (60\u2013140) broad negative trough (\u22121.1 to \u22121.3) with small ripples; (150\u2013270) steep low-frequency ascent to a local positive peak (~+1.6); (270\u2013418) long descent to the global trough (\u2248\u22121.7); (418\u2013475) rapid, high-impact recovery from the global trough across zero into sustained positive values (this recovery is the strongest positive contributor in the SHAP heatmap); (500\u2013523) short-lived small dip (higher-frequency) then (523\u2013576) final positive plateau (~+1.4\u2013+1.5).",
        "Temporal dependence and combination: The sample shows strong low-frequency structure with two main large-scale oscillations (rise around 150\u2013270 and fall around 270\u2013418) and one dominant, discriminative transition (trough-to-recovery at \u2248418\u2013475). The discriminatory evidence accumulates across these low-frequency events: deep trough depth, the steepness of the subsequent rising edge, and the final sustained positive plateau combine (in time-dependent order) to produce the pickup classification. Shorter, higher-frequency ripples modulate but do not dominate the decision.",
        "Classification basis (mapping to label 1 \u2014 pickup): Given the dataset background (vehicle outlines mapped to 1-D motion series), the model appears to use pronounced low-frequency morphology \u2014 especially a deep trough followed by a rapid, sustained recovery into a positive plateau \u2014 as the main cue for the pickup class. The SHAP heatmap localizes the strongest positive attribution to the recovery segment (\u2248418\u2013475) in the lowest STFT frequency band, indicating that the amplitude change, high slope of rebound, and the sustained positive level that follows are the primary basis for classification as label 1."

        "Observation (t \u2248 30\u2013100): The signal declines from ~1.6 down to ~0.0 with a small local bulge/peak near t\u224855\u201370 (peak ~1.2\u20131.3) before continuing the descent. Volatility is low (smooth), rate of change is moderate negative overall with a short, shallow positive inflection (the bulge). STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin. Implication: This slow, smooth front\u2011side descent with a small local hump is a coarse low\u2011frequency shape cue (a front/profile curvature). The model\u2019s positive SHAP weight here indicates this front\u2011region silhouette feature increases the probability of the sample being a minivan (label 2).",
        "Observation (t \u2248 80\u2013170): A broad negative trough centered roughly t\u2248130\u2013160 with amplitude down to about \u22121.1 to \u22121.3. The trough is smooth, wide (long duration), low volatility and dominated by very low frequencies (STFT shows almost all energy near 0 Hz), with the descent and ascent slopes being gradual. Implication: This sustained, low\u2011frequency indentation is a stable geometric depression in the 1\u2011D outline (e.g., mid\u2011body undercut or wheel well region). Its presence gives the classifier a shape signature consistent with the minivan class (contributes positively or neutrally depending on surrounding features).",
        "Observation (t \u2248 200\u2013320): A steady upward trend from slightly negative values through zero to a plateau/peak around t\u2248250\u2013290 (peak \u22480.9\u20131.0), comprising a smooth ramp with superimposed small, higher\u2011frequency micro\u2011fluctuations (minor bumps). STFT: still concentrated at very low frequencies but small local increases in slightly higher bins around the micro\u2011fluctuations. SHAP: positive contributions concentrated at the lowest frequency band in this interval. Implication: This long, low\u2011frequency rise and plateau is a major positive silhouette feature (roofline/cabin region). The model treats this low\u2011frequency rise + small micro\u2011structure as evidence toward the minivan label.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 310\u2013360): A short, sharper positive spike/peak (local maximum at \u22481.1\u20131.2 near t\u2248340) sitting on the larger mid\u2011segment plateau. This substructure is of shorter duration and steeper slope than the surrounding ramps. STFT: a small localized uptick in energy (still concentrated low). SHAP: localized positive attribution at this time/frequency. Implication: The classifier uses this higher\u2011slope micro\u2011feature (a localized protrusion in the outline) as a discriminative cue \u2014 likely corresponding to a pronounced outline element (e.g., a windshield/hood transition or mirror) that strengthens the minivan prediction.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 380\u2013480): A pronounced, deep U\u2011shaped trough centered roughly t\u2248440\u2013460 with the minimum near \u22121.7 to \u22121.8. This feature is long (wide base), smooth (very low volatility), and has steep but continuous descent/ascent (moderately high magnitude rate of change compared with earlier ramps). STFT: strongest magnitude increases still at the lowest frequency bin but with the largest absolute signal magnitude at these times. SHAP: this interval shows the strongest positive attribution (deepest red) at the lowest frequency. Implication: This broad, high\u2011magnitude trough is a major discriminative element \u2014 a large geometric recess in the silhouette (rear wheel well / trunk indentation). The SHAP signal indicates this trough strongly pushes the classifier toward the minivan label.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 480\u2013576): A persistent, relatively steep monotonic rise from the deep trough back up to about +1.7 at the end of the series. The rise is smooth, with low volatility and sustained high amplitude near the right edge. STFT: again dominated by near\u2011zero frequency. SHAP: positive at the low frequency band near the end. Implication: This sustained end\u2011rise (a rear slope/termination of the outline) is treated as a confirming, low\u2011frequency silhouette feature. Its combination with the preceding deep trough forms a distinctive rear profile signature that supports classification as a minivan.",
        "Observation (frequency domain summary): Across all red (high\u2011SHAP) regions, the STFT shows the contributions concentrated almost entirely in the lowest frequency bin(s) with negligible higher frequency energy. Implication: The classifier is relying primarily on coarse, slowly varying shape/contour information (global silhouette) rather than high\u2011frequency texture or noisy oscillations to assign the minivan label. Low\u2011frequency segments at specific times (front bulge, mid rise, local protrusion, large rear trough, final rise) are jointly important.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (t \u2248 420\u2013480) Deep trough centered near t\u2248470 with minimum \u2248 -1.9. The descent into this trough is relatively smooth and large-amplitude (a slow, low\u2011frequency negative swing spanning \u224860 time steps) with little high\u2011frequency jitter on top. The STFT shows a strong low\u2011frequency energy concentration at this time (bright band near the lowest frequency bin). SHAP shows the strongest red (positive) contribution here. Implication: the classifier treats this pronounced slow negative excursion in the mid\u2011late window as a primary positive cue for label 2 (minivan). This indicates the model is keying on a large-scale envelope feature (a deep, broad valley) rather than brief spikes.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (t \u2248 50\u201390) Early local peak around t\u224865\u201375 with amplitude \u2248 +0.8 to +1.1. This peak sits on a descending trend from the start, contains small-amplitude high\u2011frequency ripples on top, and lasts roughly 30\u201340 time steps. The STFT shows slightly elevated low\u2011frequency content at these times; SHAP shows positive contributions concentrated at the lowest frequency band. Implication: this early crest provides supporting evidence for the minivan class \u2014 a characteristic early upward bulge in the slow oscillation that the model uses in combination with later features.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (t \u2248 300\u2013350) Mid-sequence hump/crest reaching \u2248 +0.9 to +1.6 (peak near t\u2248335). The rise into this crest is relatively steep compared with the surrounding slow wave and exhibits small local micro-fluctuations (jaggedness) on the top of the main hump. The STFT again indicates low\u2011frequency dominance with modest localized energy; SHAP shows a moderate red contribution in the lowest frequency band. Implication: this mid-window positive crest acts as a secondary positive cue \u2014 the model likely recognizes the pattern of alternating broad crests/troughs (crest here + trough later) as characteristic of the target class.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (t \u2248 140\u2013210) Intermediate valley centered \u2248 t\u2248180 with amplitude \u2248 -1.2 to -1.3. This valley is shallower than the deep trough at \u2248470 and contains modest short\u2011scale fluctuations (small bumps inside the valley). SHAP shows mixed small blue (negative) contributions near some of these lower-frequency bins in this region. Implication: these blue contributions indicate portions of this valley reduce confidence for label 2 (the model may consider this particular valley shape or its finer substructure as less discriminative or sometimes indicative of other classes), so the classifier balances this against the strong positive cues elsewhere.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (frequency domain overall) STFT energy is concentrated at the lowest frequency band across almost the whole timeline with occasional bursts of higher magnitude in that lowest bin (not high-frequency content). SHAP heatmap\u2019s red areas align with this lowest-frequency band. Implication: the model\u2019s attributions are dominated by very low-frequency (long-timescale) structure \u2014 broad waves and envelope shape \u2014 rather than high-frequency transient events. Therefore, slow oscillatory shape (amplitude and phase of broad peaks/troughs) is the main discriminative information for the classifier.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (shape & temporal relation) The sample exhibits a sequence of broad alternating crests and troughs (crest near t\u224865, trough near t\u2248180, crest near t\u2248335, deep trough near t\u2248470, then strong rise to the end). These features are time-dependent (each crest/trough follows the previous with relatively consistent spacing) and show gradually varying amplitude (the late trough is the largest). Implication: the classifier apparently uses the pattern of multiple low-frequency half\u2011cycles and the relative amplitudes (notably the late deep trough combined with prior crests) as a composite signature for label 2 \u2014 i.e., the temporal order and relative magnitudes of these large-scale waves are important for the decision.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u2013160): The series starts at a high value (~+1.7 to +1.8 at t\u22480), then follows a smooth, monotonic descent that crosses the zero line near t\u224880\u201395 and reaches a local trough around t\u2248150\u2013170 at about -1.1 to -1.3. Small high-frequency ripples (amplitude on the order of 0.01\u20130.05) are superimposed on the falling slope. STFT shows the energy for this interval concentrated at the very low frequency band. SHAP heatmap has a red patch in the low-frequency row overlapping this time range. -> Implication: The model treats this early high-to-low transition and its shaped trough as positive evidence for label 2 (minivan). The combination of a large amplitude swing, the smooth low-frequency descent and the trough location are discriminative; micro-ripples modulate confidence but are secondary.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 200\u2013320): After the first trough the series rises smoothly from slightly negative values (around t\u2248210) to a pronounced local peak around t\u2248300\u2013320 at approximately +1.2 to +1.4. The rise is relatively steady (average slope roughly +0.015\u2013+0.02 per time step) and includes a short plateau / small oscillations near the top (minor fluctuations ~0.05\u20130.15). STFT still indicates dominant low-frequency energy; SHAP shows a small negative (blue) contribution near the peak in the low-frequency band. -> Implication: The steady, convex rising segment and the location/magnitude of this peak are interpreted by the model as either neutral or slightly counter-evidence for class 2 (the blue SHAP), so sharp positive peaks here reduce the model's minivan-likelihood compared with the trough features.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 320\u2013470): A steep descent follows the mid peak: the signal falls from ~+1.3 at t\u2248320 to the global minimum ~-1.6 (the most negative value in the series) centered roughly t\u2248430\u2013460. The average slope is steep (~-0.02 to -0.03 per time step). There is a small positive rebound / bump around t\u2248360\u2013380 (a short, ~0.2\u20130.4 amplitude blip) before continuing the fall into the deep trough. STFT shows concentrated low-frequency energy during this interval; SHAP heatmap has one of the strongest red concentrations at the low-frequency row overlapping the trough interval (\u2248420\u2013480). -> Implication: This deep trough together with the preceding steep descent is the strongest positive driver for class 2 in this sample. The model strongly attributes class evidence to the magnitude of the negative extreme and the sharpness of the descent into it; the small rebound is a substructure that slightly modulates attribution but does not overturn it.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 470\u2013576): After the deep trough the series undergoes a steady, relatively rapid recovery from ~-1.6 to about +1.8 at the end of the window (t=576). The rise is smooth and nearly linear on this interval (slope roughly +0.03 per step toward the end), with very low internal volatility. STFT energy remains concentrated at very low frequencies. SHAP indicates modest positive attribution in the low-frequency band toward the end of the series. -> Implication: The pronounced recovery (deep trough followed by a strong rise) reinforces the oscillatory envelope the model uses for classification; the symmetric-like recovery after the trough supports the same class evidence as earlier troughs.",
        "Observation (micro-structure across the series): Throughout the major waves there are finer-scale fluctuations: short-duration bumps, tiny ripples on slopes, and brief positive blips (notably near t\u2248260\u2013285 and t\u2248360\u2013380). These have small amplitude relative to the main oscillation (typically <0.2) and appear as faint, slightly higher-frequency content in the STFT and faint mixed-color pixels in the SHAP heatmap. -> Implication: These micro-structures act as secondary cues that slightly increase or decrease local SHAP values, but the model's classification relies primarily on the low-frequency envelope and the location/magnitude of the main extrema.",
        "Observation (frequency content): The STFT shows almost all signal energy concentrated at very low frequencies (closest to 0 on the plotted frequency axis) with only occasional, weak patches at slightly higher frequencies corresponding to the micro-ripples. There is no sustained high-frequency energy. -> Implication: The classifier uses low-frequency shape (slow, smooth waves, positions of peaks/troughs and their amplitudes) rather than transient high-frequency events to decide for label 2."

      "pattern": [
        "The feature pattern of Sample 28 is: Long, low\u2011frequency silhouette structure with several ordered coarse components corresponding to the vehicle outline from front to rear: (1) Early front region (t\u224830\u2013100) shows a moderate positive amplitude followed by a smooth descent with a small local hump (a front curvature) + (2) Mid\u2011section trough (t\u224880\u2013170) is a broad, shallow negative indentation (mid\u2011body undercut/wheel region) + (3) Central cabin/roof rise (t\u2248200\u2013320) is a smooth, low\u2011frequency ramp up through zero to a sustained plateau with small micro\u2011bumps (roofline/cabin) + (4) Short localized protrusion (t\u2248310\u2013360) is a sharper small peak on the mid\u2011section plateau (distinct outline detail) + (5) Large rear trough (t\u2248380\u2013480) is the deepest, widest negative feature in the series (dominant rear recess) + (6) Terminal steep rise (t\u2248480\u2013576) returns the signal to a high positive level (rear slope/termination).",
        "Temporal dependence and combination: The signal is dominated by slow, smoothly varying components (low\u2011frequency) that are temporally structured\u2014earlier features (front bulge and mid trough) transition into a central roofline rise and then into a very strong rear trough followed by a sustained end rise. The classifier\u2019s attribution (SHAP) concentrates on these low\u2011frequency segments at specific times rather than short high\u2011frequency fluctuations, indicating that the global order and relative amplitudes of these coarse features (front \u2192 mid \u2192 cabin \u2192 rear trough \u2192 rear rise) are used together to form the minivan decision. In other words, it is the combination of shape elements (amplitude, width, and slopes of these low\u2011frequency segments) and their relative positions along the time axis that drives the classification.",
        "The feature pattern of Sample 32 is: Broad low\u2011frequency oscillation (global) (throughout t=0\u2013577) (manifestation: dominant energy concentrated in the lowest STFT bin; smooth long-wavelength sinusoid-like envelope with small superimposed jitter) + Early positive crest (t\u224850\u201390) (manifestation: local maximum \u2248 +0.8\u20131.1 with small ripples) + Intermediate shallow valley (t\u2248140\u2013210) (manifestation: local minimum \u2248 -1.2 to -1.3 with minor micro\u2011fluctuations) + Mid positive crest (t\u2248300\u2013350) (manifestation: rise to \u2248 +0.9\u20131.6 with slight top jaggedness) + Dominant deep trough (t\u2248420\u2013480) (manifestation: largest negative excursion \u2248 -1.9, broad and smooth, strongest SHAP positive attribution) + Final recovery/rise to end (t\u2248480\u2013577) (manifestation: monotonic, relatively steep rise back to +1.6). Together these produce a time\u2011ordered signature of alternating broad crests and troughs (two\u2013three half cycles) where the late deep trough plus surrounding crests are the most discriminative elements for the minivan (label 2) classification.",
        "Overall feature pattern of Sample 58 (Label 2 - minivan):",
        "  - Large low-frequency oscillation with roughly two half-cycles across the 577 time steps: first cycle = early high (t\u22480) \u2192 long descent \u2192 trough (t\u2248150), second cycle = rise \u2192 peak (t\u2248300) \u2192 steep descent \u2192 deep trough (t\u2248430\u2013460) \u2192 strong recovery to end (t\u2248576). The dominant period is long (on the order of a few hundred time steps), consistent with concentrated STFT energy at very low frequencies.",
        "  - Amplitude structure: extremes are substantial (max \u2248 +1.7\u20131.8, min \u2248 -1.6 to -1.7). Two well-separated negative troughs and one prominent positive peak create an asymmetric oscillatory envelope (the second trough is deeper than the first).",
        "  - Volatility and rate-of-change: slopes are generally smooth; the steepest transitions are the descent into the deep trough (t\u2248320\u2013460) and the final recovery (t\u2248470\u2013576). Local volatility is low overall; only small ripples and brief rebounds appear as higher-frequency microstructures.",
        "  - Temporal dependence / combination: the classification-relevant pattern is the sequence and relative magnitudes of extrema \u2014 an initial high-to-low swing, a mid positive peak, then a pronounced drop to the deepest trough followed by recovery. The model (per SHAP) places strongest positive weight on the low-frequency troughs (particularly the deep trough around t\u2248430\u2013460 and the earlier trough region), and gives weaker or negative weight to the mid-series positive peak. Micro-features (small bumps and ripples) modulate but do not dominate the decision.",
        "  - Interpretation for class assignment: the sample\u2019s characteristic slow, large-amplitude oscillatory envelope with pronounced negative extremes (deep trough(s)) and smooth transitions is the signature pattern the classifier learned to associate with label 2 (minivan). The SHAP heatmap confirms the model attends primarily to the timing and depth of troughs in the very-low-frequency band as the main evidence for this label."

        "Observation (t \u2248 110\u2013220): A pronounced, smooth upward swing from a local minimum near -1.15 (around time step ~110) to a local maximum \u2248 +1.1\u2026+1.3 (around time step ~210). The net amplitude change is large (~2.3\u20132.5 units) over \u2248100 time steps. The rise is mostly monotonic with only small high\u2011frequency ripples (minor fluctuations of a few hundredths to a few tenths) superimposed. -> Implication: This long, high\u2011magnitude, low\u2011curvature rise is the strongest positively attributed feature (red in the SHAP heatmap) and indicates a broad, low\u2011frequency shape change that the model associates with the target class (label 3). The steady, large rate-of-change (~0.02\u20130.03 units per step on average) differentiates it from short sharp spikes and signals a slowly varying large silhouette component in the extracted vehicle outline.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 180\u2013220; subregion inside the rise): Around time steps ~180\u2013220 the trace exhibits a slight shoulder/plateau near the top of the rise \u2014 a small flattening and local micro-oscillations (several small bumps of low amplitude) just before the peak at ~210\u2013220. -> Implication: These subtle substructures (shoulder and low-amplitude oscillations) concentrate SHAP importance (reddest pixels are centered here) and likely give the classifier extra evidence: not only a large upward trend but a characteristic terminal shape (broad top/shoulder) that distinguishes this object class from others with either sharper peaks or smooth monotone rises.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 260\u2013315): A short drop from the peak back to around zero at ~270 followed by a quick upward spike to ~+1.0 at ~314. This segment is briefer (\u224850 time steps) and has a sharper change than the earlier rise (higher local slope during the spike), with small accompanying high\u2011frequency content. -> Implication: The model assigns moderate positive attribution to portions of this region (pale red), implying that brief reversals followed by a recovery/spike reinforce the overall class signal when combined with the earlier broad rise. The STFT shows slightly elevated low-frequency energy here too, consistent with a composite of slow trend + a short transient.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 366\u2013420): A strong, relatively rapid decline from ~+1.0 down to the global minimum near -2.15 (deep trough around ~390\u2013420). This decline is steeper than the earlier rise (greater negative slope) and the trough is both deeper and more prolonged (the curve stays near the minimum for several samples). -> Implication: Although this region contains large magnitude changes, the SHAP heatmap shows a mix of weak positive and some negative contributions (blue patches later). That suggests the deep trough is characteristic of the time series but the model may treat it as neutral or even mildly counter\u2011evidence depending on its exact timing/shape. The STFT shows increased energy at low frequencies during this large excursion, indicating it is a slow, large-scale feature.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u2013110): Initial downward trend from a positive offset (~+1.5 at t=0) crossing zero near ~70 and reaching the local minimum at ~110. The descent is smooth, moderately steep, and shows limited high\u2011frequency jitter. -> Implication: This long-scale initial descent provides context to the later upward swing (the valley-to-peak transition). The combination of an early high starting level followed by a deep valley and then a broad rise is likely an informative silhouette pattern that the classifier uses (in part through the positively attributed mid\u2011segment).",
        "Observation (Frequency domain): The STFT image shows most energy concentrated at very low frequencies (near the bottom of the spectrogram) throughout the series, with occasional localized increases in low-frequency magnitude (notably around the mid-rise and around the large trough). There is little persistent high\u2011frequency energy. -> Implication: The classifier leans on slow, large-scale shape components (low\u2011frequency content) rather than fast oscillatory details. This matches the SHAP emphasis on low\u2011frequency bands in the red regions, reinforcing that broad morphological features (long slopes, shoulders, deep troughs) drive the decision toward label 3.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 157\u2013209): The series shows a sustained, smooth upward ramp from about -0.9 to about +1.0 (\u0394 \u2248 +1.9) over \u224852 time steps; small high-frequency jitter (~\u00b10.05) is superimposed on the rising trend. -> Implication: A strong low-frequency (long-wavelength) rising shape in this window is an important positive contributor to the model's SUV decision (matches red region in SHAP). The STFT confirms dominant energy at very low frequencies here, so the classifier is responding to the broad shape / slope rather than fast oscillations.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 180\u2013209 \u2014 local subwindow inside the above): The slope becomes noticeably steeper compared with the immediate neighbors (shorter interval with larger per-step increase). -> Implication: This accelerated rise (local increase in first derivative) forms a distinguishable substructure (a steep shoulder) that the model treats as a salient shape cue associated with label 3.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 250\u2013280): The curve reaches a peak near +1.4 to +1.6 with a small rounded plateau and a subtle local bump/kink around t \u2248 268\u2013275 (a slight increase then small dip). -> Implication: The high absolute amplitude and the rounded peak substructure provide additional positive evidence (large-scale geometry) for the SUV class; STFT still shows low-frequency dominance, indicating this is a slow, global shape feature rather than a transient oscillation.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 80\u2013130): Prior to the rise, the trace contains a broad negative trough with minimum near -1.1 to -1.25 around t \u2248 100\u2013120; the trough is smooth with minor noise-level fluctuations. -> Implication: The preceding deep valley followed by the long rise creates a large amplitude swing (peak-to-trough \u0394 \u2248 2.5\u20132.7) \u2014 a global bimodal shape that the classifier likely uses as a distinguishing SUV outline signature (contrast between low and high envelope).",
        "Observation (t \u2248 360\u2013430): Later in the record there is a pronounced descent from near +0.5 down to a deep trough near -2.0 at t \u2248 415\u2013425 (steep, large-amplitude negative excursion). -> Implication: Although this large downward feature is a major geometric component of the time series, the SHAP heatmap shows less positive / even negative contribution in that exact region (blue around ~471); thus the model may treat that deep post-peak trough as either neutral or mildly counter-evidence for the SUV label, possibly because it is more characteristic of other classes or because the earlier rise/peak pattern is more diagnostic.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 470\u2013525): There is a subsequent recovery: a steady upward trend from the deep trough to about +0.3\u2013+1.0 (moderate slope) and a short sharper bump around t \u2248 500\u2013520 with slightly higher volatility (micro-fluctuations larger than earlier baselines). -> Implication: This recovery contributes modestly to classification; local higher volatility here appears in STFT as slightly raised low-frequency energy but SHAP shows mixed/weak contribution \u2014 it may refine the silhouette but is not the primary discriminative region.",
        "Observation (frequency domain overall): The STFT map shows signal energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during the red SHAP time regions (very little high-frequency content anywhere). -> Implication: The classifier relies mainly on slow, large-scale geometric features (low-frequency components, long-duration bulges and troughs) rather than rapid oscillatory behavior to make the SUV decision.",
        "Observation (volatility comparison): The most diagnostic windows (SHAP-red) are low-volatility, smooth, large-amplitude long-wavelength features, whereas the slightly noisier micro-fluctuations across the trace have small or mixed SHAP values. -> Implication: The model emphasizes macro-shape (envelope) features over small noise-like variance when attributing evidence for label 3."

        "Overall pattern of Sample 51: An early positive baseline (t\u22480) followed by a smooth, moderate descent to a local trough (t\u22480\u2013110), then a long, high\u2011amplitude, low\u2011frequency upward ramp (t\u2248110\u2013220) culminating in a rounded peak/shoulder (t\u2248180\u2013220). This is followed by a brief correction to ~0 and a short spike (t\u2248260\u2013315), then a steep, deep decline to the global minimum (t\u2248366\u2013420) and a final recovery to positive values toward the end (t\u2248420\u2013576).",
        "Temporal dependence and composition: The series is dominated by slow, large-scale trends (low\u2011frequency content) with small superimposed high\u2011frequency ripples. Key discriminative structure is the valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded peak motif in the mid\u2011section (t\u2248110\u2013220), which the SHAP heatmap marks as the strongest positive contributor. Shorter transients (the post\u2011peak spike and the deep trough) modulate model evidence \u2014 the spike tends to add positive support while the trough contributes mixed or negative evidence depending on exact shape and timing.",
        "Characteristic statistics: The main upward event (t\u2248110\u2013220) exhibits the largest amplitude swing (~+2.3 to +2.5 units) and a moderate average slope (~0.02\u20130.03 units/time step). Volatility is low overall (small local fluctuations) except for a few sharper transitions (notably the spike near t\u2248314 and the descent into the deep trough t\u2248366\u2013420).",
        "Implication for class separation: The sample\u2019s dominant low\u2011frequency, large\u2011amplitude mid\u2011section (valley-to-shoulder) combined with the subsequent short spike and the later deep trough create a composite silhouette pattern that the classifier recognizes for label 3. The SHAP map confirms the classifier relies principally on the broad mid-rise/shoulder low\u2011frequency features rather than high\u2011frequency noise.",
        "The feature pattern of Sample 9 is: Broad negative valley (t \u2248 80\u2013130) (smooth trough, amplitude \u2248 -1.1) + Strong low-frequency rising shoulder (t \u2248 157\u2013209) (steady-to-steep increase, \u0394 \u2248 +1.9, low volatility) + Rounded high amplitude peak/plateau (t \u2248 250\u2013280) (peak \u2248 +1.4\u20131.6 with small local kink) + Large post-peak descent to deep trough (t \u2248 360\u2013430) (steep drop to \u2248 -2.0) + Recovery bump (t \u2248 470\u2013525) (moderate rise with slightly increased micro-volatility). Overall the series is dominated by low-frequency, large-amplitude, slowly varying shape features (strong time-dependence between troughs and peaks); the classifier attributes positive evidence for the SUV label primarily to the long-wavelength rising shoulder and the high-amplitude rounded peak (red SHAP at lowest frequencies around t \u2248 157\u2013280)."
