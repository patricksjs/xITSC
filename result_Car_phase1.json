        "Observation (t \u2248 80\u2013140): the series falls from near 0 to a pronounced local trough around -1.15 to -1.25 (minimum at \u2248120). The descent is smooth and relatively slow (broad curvature) with small high-frequency ripples (tiny superposed wiggles) on the trough\u2019s flank. -> Implication: the model attributes this low-frequency, deep negative lobe (broad trough + fine jitter) positively (red at low frequency). That indicates the sedan class is associated with a large, smooth concave outline segment (low-frequency shape) plus small local detail at the trough.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 200\u2013300): the series rises from slightly negative/near-zero to a broad positive peak \u2248 +1.5\u20131.6 (peak centered \u2248270). The rise is steeper than the prior descent and the peak shows a short plateau with small rapid fluctuations (minor bumps) on top. -> Implication: low-frequency positive lobe and the short plateau at the crest strongly contribute to classification (SHAP red at bottom-frequency band here). The presence of a wide, high-amplitude convex segment with small top-of-crest wiggles is a discriminative sedan feature.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 340\u2013440): the series transitions from positive through zero to the global trough near -1.7 (deepest value at \u2248420). This fall is the steepest in the record and the trough is narrower and slightly sharper than the first trough, again with micro-fluctuations on its flanks. -> Implication: the deep, low-frequency negative lobe (especially its near-zero-to-trough slope and depth) is a primary positive contributor to the sedan label (strong SHAP red at low frequency around this time). The model favors this pronounced low-frequency valley as evidence.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 500\u2013576): the series climbs from negative/near-zero up to a final positive plateau \u2248 +1.5\u20131.65 with a fairly steady slope; small local bumps appear on the rising flank and near the late peak. -> Implication: sustained low-frequency upward trend and terminal high-amplitude peak contribute positively (SHAP red near end). The endpoint positive lobe reinforces the overall low-frequency envelope pattern the classifier expects for sedans.",
        "Observation (frequency domain): STFT shows the signal energy concentrated at the lowest frequencies (bottom rows) throughout the timeline; occasional minor increases in very-low-frequency energy align with the same time windows as SHAP red regions. Very little mid/high-frequency energy is present except for weak bursts at extrema. -> Implication: the classifier relies mainly on low-frequency (long-period) shape features \u2014 the broad lobes and their timing \u2014 rather than high-frequency texture. Small high-frequency ripples at extrema provide secondary cues.",
        "Observation (local substructure): at each major extremum there are small-scale oscillations (tiny zigzags) visible in the time plot and as small high-frequency components in the STFT; SHAP shows positive attribution mainly at the low-frequency band but also modest positive mass where those small ripples appear. -> Implication: the classifier uses coarse outline (low-frequency envelope) as primary evidence and uses the micro-fluctuations at extrema as supportive fine-grained features for distinguishing sedan from other vehicle types.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 150\u2013210): The SHAP heatmap shows a strong red cluster concentrated at the lowest frequency band between roughly time steps 150 and 210. In the raw signal this interval corresponds to a smooth, sustained upward swing: values move from about -1.1 (near the trough) through zero to roughly +0.2. The rise is gradual (no sharp spikes), with small superimposed micro\u2011ripples but low short\u2011term volatility. -> Implication: The classifier attributes positive evidence for the 'sedan' class to this low\u2011frequency, steady upward trend \u2014 i.e. a slow DC/low\u2011frequency transition from negative to positive amplitude is an informative signature for this label.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 200\u2013280): There is continued positive SHAP support extending into the interval ~200\u2013280 where the series climbs to and briefly plateaus at a local maximum around +1.3 to +1.6. The shape is a rounded peak (not a sharp spike) with very low high\u2011frequency content and only slight jitter on top of the plateau. -> Implication: A sustained positive plateau / rounded peak at low frequency is further evidence the model uses; persistent high amplitude in the positive direction (stable, low volatility peak) increases probability of the sample being labeled as a sedan.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 300\u2013360): A secondary red region in the SHAP heatmap (lowest freq row) aligns with the later portion of the positive peak and the start of the downward slope. The signal in this window sits at elevated values (~+1.4 to +1.6) and shows a gentle downturn after the plateau, again with low volatility. -> Implication: The model also rewards the persistence of that positive, slowly changing structure; the timing and duration of the high plateau and its subsequent slow descent are considered characteristic of the target class.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 80\u2013130): The earlier trough (around time steps 80\u2013130) is deep (\u2248 -1.0 to -1.2) and fairly smooth, with a short, slightly noisy bottom (small local micro\u2011fluctuations visible as tiny wiggles). The STFT shows minimal high\u2011frequency energy here but clear low\u2011frequency content. -> Implication: Deep, smooth negative troughs followed by a steady recovery appear to be part of the same slow oscillatory pattern that the model exploits; the trough + gradual recovery sequence contributes indirectly to the positive classification through the subsequent upward transition.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 380\u2013440): The second major trough is deeper (\u2248 -1.6 to -1.85) and longer in duration than the first trough. That downward swing is smooth but reaches a larger negative amplitude and takes longer to reverse. SHAP here is weak/neutral to slightly negative (pale blue patches), i.e., this deep trough is not strongly positively attributed. -> Implication: The model seems to prefer the presence of the positive plateau and the preceding upward transition more than extreme negative excursions; deep long troughs are either neutral or slightly reduce the classifier confidence for this label.",
        "Observation (microstructure across the series): Small, high\u2011frequency ripples appear throughout (most visible at peaks and trough bottoms) \u2014 low amplitude, short duration oscillations superimposed on the dominant slow wave. STFT shows these as very faint higher frequency bins, while the SHAP heatmap is mostly blank for those frequencies. -> Implication: These micro\u2011ripples are likely noise or minor outline detail; they have little positive SHAP weight and do not drive the sedan classification strongly.",
        "Observation (frequency-domain): The STFT image shows almost all measurable energy concentrated at the lowest frequency band (near 0.0 on the frequency axis), with occasional low\u2011frequency bursts aligned with the SHAP red windows; there is negligible energy above the lowest bins. -> Implication: The classifier relies predominantly on very low\u2011frequency / slowly varying components (the gross shape of the outline over hundreds of time steps) rather than on higher frequency features to identify this sample as a sedan.",
        "Observation (temporal dependence): Positive attribution (red) in SHAP is concentrated at slow upward transitions and sustained positive plateaus; negative attributions (blue) are scattered during long negative valleys and some small short windows. The positive windows are separated in time by the slow oscillatory cycle (roughly two main cycles across 577 steps). -> Implication: The model\u2019s decision uses temporal context \u2014 it rewards the sequence of trough \u2192 steady rise \u2192 positive plateau as a coherent pattern. Isolated instantaneous values are less important than these structured, time\u2011extended events."

        "The feature pattern of Sample 0 is: Dominant low-frequency oscillation (global waveform) with period ~250\u2013300 time steps producing successive lobes: 1) First negative lobe (t \u2248 80\u2013140) broad trough \u2248 -1.2 with small local jitter; 2) First major positive lobe (t \u2248 200\u2013300) broad peak \u2248 +1.5\u20131.6 with a short plateau and micro-fluctuations; 3) Deep central/trailing negative lobe (t \u2248 340\u2013440) sharpest and deepest trough \u2248 -1.7; 4) Final positive rise and plateau (t \u2248 500\u2013576) returning to \u2248 +1.6. These low-frequency lobes are the dominant structure (STFT energy concentrated at near-zero frequency). Volatility is low overall (smooth curves) with localized small high-frequency ripples at extrema. Time-series dependence: large-scale envelope is periodic/oscillatory (two long cycles across the sequence) with asymmetric slopes between rises and falls (some descents steeper than rises). The classifier\u2019s attribution (SHAP) focuses on the low-frequency energy at the times of these lobes (especially troughs and peaks), implying the model uses the shape, amplitude and timing of these broad outline segments \u2014 plus minor high-frequency detail at extrema \u2014 to decide the sample is a sedan.",
        "Overall pattern of Sample 42: A dominant slow oscillatory waveform with roughly two full cycles over 577 time steps. Manifestations: (1) Cycle 1: initial high value (~+1.6) \u2192 smooth decline to trough (~ -1.1) by ~100\u2013130 \u2192 steady rise and crossing of zero around 200 \u2192 rounded positive peak (~+1.3 to +1.6) around 260\u2013300. (2) Cycle 2: slow decline to a deeper trough (~ -1.6 to -1.85) around 410\u2013430 \u2192 final steady rise to ~+1.5 at the series end. The waveform is low\u2011frequency dominated (STFT energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin) and is generally smooth with small, low\u2011amplitude high\u2011frequency ripples superimposed. Volatility is low during plateaus/peaks and trough bottoms, higher only at gradual transition flanks. Temporal dependence: the classifier favors the specific temporal sequence trough \u2192 slow upward transition \u2192 sustained positive plateau (positive SHAP concentrated on these low\u2011frequency segments at t \u2248 150\u2013280 and t \u2248 300\u2013360), while long, deep negative valleys contribute neutral or slightly negative evidence.",
        "How these combine to support the label (sedan): The model appears to key on very-low-frequency morphological features \u2014 specifically the presence, timing and duration of smooth upward transitions and sustained positive plateaus within the slow oscillatory cycle. Those features (occurring ~150\u2013360 and again in the latter part of the series) are the most positively attributed by SHAP and thus form the basis for classification as label 0 (sedan)."

      "feature": [
        "Observation: Strong positive SHAP cluster centered ~t=160\u2013220 at the lowest frequency band. On the time plot this corresponds to the interval from about step 150 to 220 where the series moves from a local trough (\u2248 -1.2 to -1.3) into a sustained upward ramp ending near +0.0 to +0.6. The change is composed of a clear inflection and a steady positive slope with small superimposed ripples. -> Implication: The model attributes the upward inflection and ensuing low-frequency rise in that window as a positive cue for the pickup label. This feature is a low-frequency, moderate-amplitude recovery (peak-to-local-trough ~1.8\u20132.0 overall when combined with surrounding context) with limited high-frequency volatility, indicating a slow body-motion signature the classifier finds discriminative.",
        "Observation: From t\u2248200 to t\u2248280 the signal has a sharp, sustained rise from roughly -1.2 up to a local maximum \u2248 +1.6. Average slope \u2248 +0.035 units/step, with small high-frequency bumps (short-period fluctuations of small amplitude) layered on top of the rise. STFT shows increased low-frequency energy during this rise. -> Implication: The pronounced, relatively fast low-frequency ascent is a distinct substructure (deep trough \u2192 sharp crest) that the classifier uses as a positive indicator. The combination of high magnitude change and low-frequency content suggests a major vehicle silhouette change (e.g., a frontal/shape transition typical of pickups in the dataset).",
        "Observation: A concentrated red SHAP patch is also visible near t\u2248470\u2013520 at low frequency. On the time trace this maps to the final recovery segment (\u2248 t=420 to 576) where the signal climbs from the global trough (\u2248 -1.7 at ~420) back up to \u2248 +1.5 at the end, with a small dip/plateau around t\u2248520. The rise from trough to end is \u223c3.2 units over ~156 steps (avg slope \u2248 +0.0205). -> Implication: The classifier gives positive attribution to the long, low-frequency recovery late in the sequence. This sustained, large amplitude rebound (global trough \u2192 final high) appears to be another hallmark the model associates with the pickup class \u2014 a broad slow oscillation rather than short, noisy wiggles.",
        "Observation: Early segment t\u22480\u2013120 shows a monotonic decline from \u2248+1.55 down to \u2248 -0.8 with local smaller dips around t\u224880\u2013120 (small bulges and micro-fluctuations). STFT and SHAP show only weak low-frequency energy and only faint positive attribution in parts of this interval. -> Implication: The initial monotonic descent is part of the larger slow oscillation but is less discriminative on its own. Its presence provides context (starting high then falling) that amplifies the later trough\u2192rise transitions which the classifier finds more informative.",
        "Observation: The deepest trough occurs near t\u2248420 at approximately -1.6 to -1.7 and is wide (sustained negative values across ~t=370\u2013450) with a smooth concave bottom and minimal high-frequency noise. -> Implication: The broad, deep trough is a stable low-frequency feature that, when followed by a long recovery, strengthens the pickup attribution. The model likely leverages the trough depth and width (large negative excursion) combined with subsequent recovery as a discriminative motion pattern.",
        "Observation: Small-scale oscillatory substructure: around the trough-to-rise transitions (both near t\u2248150\u2013220 and t\u2248420\u2013576) there are short, low-amplitude bumps and tiny local maxima/minima (visible as small jagged deviations). STFT shows these are minor and concentrated at the very lowest frequency bins (i.e., slow variations), not broad high-frequency bands. -> Implication: These micro-fluctuations modulate the main slow trends and may help timing alignment for the classifier (providing additional localized shape cues), but the principal signal comes from low-frequency trend shapes.",
        "Observation: Relative rates of change differ across major segments: initial descent (t\u22480\u2013150) is moderate negative slope (~ -0.016\u2013 -0.02 units/step), the ascent to the mid-peak (t\u2248200\u2013280) is the steepest positive slope (~ +0.035 units/step), the fall to the global trough (t\u2248280\u2013420) is again steep negative (~ -0.0236 units/step). -> Implication: The asymmetry in slope magnitudes (a relatively sharper mid-rise followed by a deeper but somewhat slower decline) yields a characteristic asymmetric oscillatory cycle. The classifier appears sensitive to these slope patterns (steep ascent vs. broad deep descent) when identifying pickups.",
        "Observation: STFT (time-frequency) image shows almost all signal energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin(s) across the whole sequence with occasional low-frequency power increases around the times of the major rises (\u2248 t=200\u2013280) and deep trough (\u2248 t=370\u2013420). There is no sustained high-frequency band activity. -> Implication: The discriminative features are predominantly slow, large-scale shape changes (very low-frequency components). The classifier\u2019s SHAP heatmap correctly localizes importance to these low-frequency events rather than transient high-frequency noise.",
        "Observation: SHAP shows few blue (negative) contributions and the main red (positive) patches align with the two upward recoveries and the midrise. -> Implication: The model strongly favors presence of those low-frequency upward transitions as evidence towards label 1 (pickup); absence or inversion of those transitions would likely reduce pickup probability.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 157\u2013209): A pronounced, long-duration negative excursion (deep trough) centered around t \u2248 175\u2013190 with minimum value \u2248 -1.5 to -1.7. The trough spans roughly 40\u201360 time steps, has a smooth curved bottom with small superimposed high-frequency jitter (\u00b10.02\u20130.06), and is preceded by a sustained downward slope and followed by a relatively rapid upward slope. -> Implication: The model attributes strong positive evidence (red in SHAP) to this low-frequency, large-amplitude valley. This indicates the classifier relies on an extended negative half-wave (its amplitude, width and curvature) as a distinguishing low-frequency feature for the pickup class.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 210\u2013320): A strong recovery/positive rebound immediately after the trough rising from \u2248 -1.6 up to a local peak \u2248 +1.4\u20131.5 around t \u2248 300\u2013320. The rise is steeper than the preceding descent (higher rate of change), and the rising limb contains small plateau-like substructure around t \u2248 270\u2013300 (minor local dips and bumps). -> Implication: The paired pattern of a deep trough followed by a relatively rapid, high-amplitude rebound (negative-to-positive half-cycle) forms a half-cycle oscillatory signature that the model uses as further positive evidence for label 1. The shape asymmetry (slower descent, faster ascent) is likely informative.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u2013120): A long, gradual decline from an initial high (\u2248 +1.6 at t\u22480) toward zero and into negative values. The slope is moderate and relatively smooth with small, low-amplitude fluctuations superimposed. -> Implication: This long-run downward trend provides contextual baseline that leads into the pronounced mid-sequence trough; as a contextual low-frequency trend it helps the model recognize the overall waveform phase and reinforces attribution to the trough/rebound event.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 400\u2013480): A second prominent negative excursion (another deep trough) reaching \u2248 -1.4 to -1.55 around t \u2248 450 with a similar width (\u2248 40\u201360 steps) and then rising afterward. In the SHAP map this later trough shows little or slightly negative contribution (blue tint near t\u2248470). -> Implication: Although morphologically similar to the earlier trough, the model gives less positive (or slightly negative) attribution to this second trough \u2014 indicating the classifier is sensitive to the timing/location of the trough in the cycle (the earlier trough is more diagnostic for the pickup label than the later one).",
        "Observation (micro-structure across series): Small high-frequency jitter (short spikes/bulges of amplitude \u00b10.01\u20130.06) are visible on top of the dominant slow waveform, especially near inflection points (just before the trough bottom and near peak). STFT shows most energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bands, with minor power across slightly higher but still low frequencies. -> Implication: The classifier relies mainly on low-frequency, long-duration waveform shapes (large half-waves) rather than on transient high-frequency noise. The small jitter is likely not a primary driver of the pickup classification but may slightly modulate attribution at inflection points.",
        "Observation (frequency-domain corroboration): The STFT shows dominant energy at very low frequencies (closest to 0 Hz) across the whole sequence with localized increases in magnitude aligned with the large amplitude half-cycles (not distinct high-frequency bands). -> Implication: The features the model uses are long-duration (low-frequency) components \u2014 amplitude and phase of slow oscillations \u2014 consistent with the SHAP emphasis on the low-frequency rows. The positive SHAP region aligns with a time window where low-frequency magnitude increases, confirming attribution to large-scale shape rather than transient frequency events.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u201360): The series begins at a high positive value (~+1.5) and shows a steady monotonic decrease to around 0, with a moderate slope and low short-term volatility. -> Implication: An initial high baseline followed by a smooth downward drift indicates a slow, low-frequency change in the silhouette/motion at the start of the recording; this low-frequency component contributes weakly but consistently to the class score (small positive SHAP near the start in the bottom frequency band of the STFT).",
        "Observation (t \u2248 60\u2013140): The signal continues downward into a local negative trough around \u22121.1 to \u22121.3 with small superimposed high-frequency jitter (small ripples on the trough). The descent into the trough is reasonably gradual (~several tens of time steps) and the trough is somewhat flattened rather than a sharp spike. -> Implication: A broad negative excursion with small local fluctuations suggests a sustained change in outline (e.g., body-mid section) rather than a brief artifact; the low-frequency energy during this trough is visible in the STFT bottom band and corresponds to modest SHAP activity (mixed small red/blue), so this region partially informs but does not dominate the pickup classification.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 150\u2013270): A pronounced, relatively rapid ascent from about \u22120.9 up to a local peak near +1.6\u2013+1.7 occurs between ~180 and ~270, with the steepest slope roughly centered around ~230\u2013270. The rise contains small stepped substructure near the peak (tiny oscillations/plateaus around the maximum). -> Implication: This strong low-frequency upward swing with a sharp rising edge increases low-frequency STFT magnitude and corresponds to positive SHAP contributions in adjacent time windows; this upward transition likely encodes a salient morphological change that the model associates positively with the pickup class.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 270\u2013418): Following the peak, there is a long, smooth decline from +1.6 down to the global minimum near \u22121.7 at \u2248418. The fall is relatively steady but accelerates approaching the trough; there are small higher-frequency perturbations superimposed, particularly between 300\u2013360 (minor ripples). -> Implication: A deep, broad negative excursion (largest amplitude in the sample) concentrates energy in the lowest STFT frequency bin and is reflected in mixed SHAP influence (some small negative SHAP around the descending phase), indicating the trough itself is an important discriminative event \u2014 its depth and the slope into it are informative for classification.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 418\u2013475): The region highlighted strongly in red on the SHAP heatmap corresponds to a sharp, sustained upward recovery starting at the global trough (~\u22121.7 at 418) and crossing zero around ~470, continuing to reach positive territory (~+1.0 by ~500). This recovery has a relatively high rate of change (steep slope) and limited high-frequency noise \u2014 mostly a smooth low-frequency ramp with a short sharper inflection about midway. STFT shows increased low-frequency magnitude here (bottom rows) aligned with the red SHAP band. -> Implication: The rapid rebound from the deepest trough is a major positive contributor to the pickup classification (high positive SHAP). It likely encodes a distinctive silhouette/motion transition (e.g., sudden change in outline height/profile) that the model uses as a strong indicator for label 1.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 500\u2013523): A brief local dip occurs just after the major rising segment: amplitude drops from ~+1.0 to ~+0.6 (a small trough) between ~500\u2013523, then quickly recovers. This dip is short duration (\u224820\u201330 time steps) and higher-frequency relative to the larger waves. -> Implication: The short post-recovery dip introduces higher-frequency content in the STFT (small increase in middle/lower bins) and corresponds to localized negative SHAP patches; it acts as a minor counter-indicator but is outweighed by the strong positive effect of the prior recovery.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 523\u2013576): From ~523 to the end the signal climbs again and then plateaus in the positive range (~+1.4\u2013+1.5) with very low volatility (flat top). -> Implication: A final sustained positive plateau (low-frequency DC-like component) consolidates the positive evidence; STFT shows persistent low-frequency energy and SHAP shows smaller positive contributions here, reinforcing the classification contributed by the earlier rebound.",
        "Observation (Frequency content overall): The STFT is dominated by the lowest frequency band (near 0 Hz) across most time windows; there is minimal high-frequency energy except for brief ripples at transition points. -> Implication: The classifier relies mainly on slow morphological / shape changes (large-scale oscillations) rather than high-frequency texture \u2014 the red SHAP energy aligns with bottom-frequency bins, confirming slow transitions (especially the trough-to-peak rebound) are the discriminative cues for label 1."

        "Overall feature pattern of Sample 2 (label 1 - pickup):",
        "Feature A (initial high then monotonic decline) (t\u22480\u2013150): The sequence begins at a relatively high normalized value (\u2248+1.55) and decreases steadily to around -0.8. This sets a baseline slow downward trend with small local fluctuations\u2014providing context for later large excursions.",
        "Feature B (local trough and low-frequency recovery) (t\u2248150\u2013220): A localized trough near -1.2 followed by a clear low-frequency inflection and upward ramp. This interval carries strong positive attribution (SHAP) and represents a discriminative slow recovery substructure.",
        "Feature C (sharp low-frequency ascent to mid-peak) (t\u2248200\u2013280): A pronounced rise from trough to a local maximum \u2248+1.6. This is the steepest increase in the sequence (largest average slope) and is accompanied by increased low-frequency energy in the STFT\u2014another strongly-weighted cue for the model.",
        "Feature D (pronounced descent to global trough) (t\u2248280\u2013420): After the mid-peak the signal descends to the global minimum \u2248-1.6 to -1.7. The trough is broad and smooth (low volatility), producing a deep negative excursion that forms the nadir of the main oscillation.",
        "Feature E (long recovery to final high) (t\u2248420\u2013576): A sustained, low-frequency recovery from the global trough back to \u2248+1.5 at the end. This long rebound carries positive SHAP attribution and mirrors Feature B/C at a larger scale.",
        "Temporal dependence and combination: The sample shows a slow, multi-stage oscillatory pattern (down \u2192 up \u2192 down \u2192 up) dominated by very low-frequency components. The classifier emphasizes the timing and shape of transitions (especially trough\u2192rise events) rather than short-lived noise. The mid-sequence steep ascent and the final broad recovery together (both large amplitude, low-frequency sign changes) form the core discriminative pattern that the model maps to the pickup class.",
        "Overall feature pattern for Sample 4 (Label 1 - pickup): A slow, large-amplitude oscillatory waveform dominated by low-frequency half-cycles. Sequence structure: (1) Initial high plateau and gradual decline (t \u2248 0\u2013120) that establishes a downward phase; (2) A diagnostic deep trough (t \u2248 157\u2013209) with large negative amplitude (\u2248 -1.6), smooth curved bottom and small local jitter; (3) A relatively fast, high-amplitude rebound to a local positive peak (t \u2248 210\u2013320, peak \u2248 +1.4\u20131.5) with slight plateau/bump substructure on the rising limb; (4) A later second trough (t \u2248 400\u2013480) of similar amplitude but weaker positive attribution; (5) Low overall volatility aside from small superimposed high-frequency jitter at inflection points. Time dependence: the sample exhibits clear long-range dependence (slow half-wave cycles) where the timing and amplitude of the mid-sequence trough + rebound pair form the primary discriminative pattern. The STFT confirms the dominance of very low-frequency energy, and SHAP shows the model mainly uses the early-to-mid trough region (low-frequency, large-amplitude shape) to classify this sample as a pickup.",
        "The feature pattern of Sample 43 is: Long-period biphasic waveform + sharp recovery: (0\u201360) initial high baseline with smooth decline; (60\u2013140) broad negative trough (\u22121.1 to \u22121.3) with small ripples; (150\u2013270) steep low-frequency ascent to a local positive peak (~+1.6); (270\u2013418) long descent to the global trough (\u2248\u22121.7); (418\u2013475) rapid, high-impact recovery from the global trough across zero into sustained positive values (this recovery is the strongest positive contributor in the SHAP heatmap); (500\u2013523) short-lived small dip (higher-frequency) then (523\u2013576) final positive plateau (~+1.4\u2013+1.5).",
        "Temporal dependence and combination: The sample shows strong low-frequency structure with two main large-scale oscillations (rise around 150\u2013270 and fall around 270\u2013418) and one dominant, discriminative transition (trough-to-recovery at \u2248418\u2013475). The discriminatory evidence accumulates across these low-frequency events: deep trough depth, the steepness of the subsequent rising edge, and the final sustained positive plateau combine (in time-dependent order) to produce the pickup classification. Shorter, higher-frequency ripples modulate but do not dominate the decision.",
        "Classification basis (mapping to label 1 \u2014 pickup): Given the dataset background (vehicle outlines mapped to 1-D motion series), the model appears to use pronounced low-frequency morphology \u2014 especially a deep trough followed by a rapid, sustained recovery into a positive plateau \u2014 as the main cue for the pickup class. The SHAP heatmap localizes the strongest positive attribution to the recovery segment (\u2248418\u2013475) in the lowest STFT frequency band, indicating that the amplitude change, high slope of rebound, and the sustained positive level that follows are the primary basis for classification as label 1."

        "Observation (t \u2248 30\u2013100): The signal declines from ~1.6 down to ~0.0 with a small local bulge/peak near t\u224855\u201370 (peak ~1.2\u20131.3) before continuing the descent. Volatility is low (smooth), rate of change is moderate negative overall with a short, shallow positive inflection (the bulge). STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin. Implication: This slow, smooth front\u2011side descent with a small local hump is a coarse low\u2011frequency shape cue (a front/profile curvature). The model\u2019s positive SHAP weight here indicates this front\u2011region silhouette feature increases the probability of the sample being a minivan (label 2).",
        "Observation (t \u2248 80\u2013170): A broad negative trough centered roughly t\u2248130\u2013160 with amplitude down to about \u22121.1 to \u22121.3. The trough is smooth, wide (long duration), low volatility and dominated by very low frequencies (STFT shows almost all energy near 0 Hz), with the descent and ascent slopes being gradual. Implication: This sustained, low\u2011frequency indentation is a stable geometric depression in the 1\u2011D outline (e.g., mid\u2011body undercut or wheel well region). Its presence gives the classifier a shape signature consistent with the minivan class (contributes positively or neutrally depending on surrounding features).",
        "Observation (t \u2248 200\u2013320): A steady upward trend from slightly negative values through zero to a plateau/peak around t\u2248250\u2013290 (peak \u22480.9\u20131.0), comprising a smooth ramp with superimposed small, higher\u2011frequency micro\u2011fluctuations (minor bumps). STFT: still concentrated at very low frequencies but small local increases in slightly higher bins around the micro\u2011fluctuations. SHAP: positive contributions concentrated at the lowest frequency band in this interval. Implication: This long, low\u2011frequency rise and plateau is a major positive silhouette feature (roofline/cabin region). The model treats this low\u2011frequency rise + small micro\u2011structure as evidence toward the minivan label.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 310\u2013360): A short, sharper positive spike/peak (local maximum at \u22481.1\u20131.2 near t\u2248340) sitting on the larger mid\u2011segment plateau. This substructure is of shorter duration and steeper slope than the surrounding ramps. STFT: a small localized uptick in energy (still concentrated low). SHAP: localized positive attribution at this time/frequency. Implication: The classifier uses this higher\u2011slope micro\u2011feature (a localized protrusion in the outline) as a discriminative cue \u2014 likely corresponding to a pronounced outline element (e.g., a windshield/hood transition or mirror) that strengthens the minivan prediction.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 380\u2013480): A pronounced, deep U\u2011shaped trough centered roughly t\u2248440\u2013460 with the minimum near \u22121.7 to \u22121.8. This feature is long (wide base), smooth (very low volatility), and has steep but continuous descent/ascent (moderately high magnitude rate of change compared with earlier ramps). STFT: strongest magnitude increases still at the lowest frequency bin but with the largest absolute signal magnitude at these times. SHAP: this interval shows the strongest positive attribution (deepest red) at the lowest frequency. Implication: This broad, high\u2011magnitude trough is a major discriminative element \u2014 a large geometric recess in the silhouette (rear wheel well / trunk indentation). The SHAP signal indicates this trough strongly pushes the classifier toward the minivan label.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 480\u2013576): A persistent, relatively steep monotonic rise from the deep trough back up to about +1.7 at the end of the series. The rise is smooth, with low volatility and sustained high amplitude near the right edge. STFT: again dominated by near\u2011zero frequency. SHAP: positive at the low frequency band near the end. Implication: This sustained end\u2011rise (a rear slope/termination of the outline) is treated as a confirming, low\u2011frequency silhouette feature. Its combination with the preceding deep trough forms a distinctive rear profile signature that supports classification as a minivan.",
        "Observation (frequency domain summary): Across all red (high\u2011SHAP) regions, the STFT shows the contributions concentrated almost entirely in the lowest frequency bin(s) with negligible higher frequency energy. Implication: The classifier is relying primarily on coarse, slowly varying shape/contour information (global silhouette) rather than high\u2011frequency texture or noisy oscillations to assign the minivan label. Low\u2011frequency segments at specific times (front bulge, mid rise, local protrusion, large rear trough, final rise) are jointly important.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (t \u2248 420\u2013480) Deep trough centered near t\u2248470 with minimum \u2248 -1.9. The descent into this trough is relatively smooth and large-amplitude (a slow, low\u2011frequency negative swing spanning \u224860 time steps) with little high\u2011frequency jitter on top. The STFT shows a strong low\u2011frequency energy concentration at this time (bright band near the lowest frequency bin). SHAP shows the strongest red (positive) contribution here. Implication: the classifier treats this pronounced slow negative excursion in the mid\u2011late window as a primary positive cue for label 2 (minivan). This indicates the model is keying on a large-scale envelope feature (a deep, broad valley) rather than brief spikes.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (t \u2248 50\u201390) Early local peak around t\u224865\u201375 with amplitude \u2248 +0.8 to +1.1. This peak sits on a descending trend from the start, contains small-amplitude high\u2011frequency ripples on top, and lasts roughly 30\u201340 time steps. The STFT shows slightly elevated low\u2011frequency content at these times; SHAP shows positive contributions concentrated at the lowest frequency band. Implication: this early crest provides supporting evidence for the minivan class \u2014 a characteristic early upward bulge in the slow oscillation that the model uses in combination with later features.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (t \u2248 300\u2013350) Mid-sequence hump/crest reaching \u2248 +0.9 to +1.6 (peak near t\u2248335). The rise into this crest is relatively steep compared with the surrounding slow wave and exhibits small local micro-fluctuations (jaggedness) on the top of the main hump. The STFT again indicates low\u2011frequency dominance with modest localized energy; SHAP shows a moderate red contribution in the lowest frequency band. Implication: this mid-window positive crest acts as a secondary positive cue \u2014 the model likely recognizes the pattern of alternating broad crests/troughs (crest here + trough later) as characteristic of the target class.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (t \u2248 140\u2013210) Intermediate valley centered \u2248 t\u2248180 with amplitude \u2248 -1.2 to -1.3. This valley is shallower than the deep trough at \u2248470 and contains modest short\u2011scale fluctuations (small bumps inside the valley). SHAP shows mixed small blue (negative) contributions near some of these lower-frequency bins in this region. Implication: these blue contributions indicate portions of this valley reduce confidence for label 2 (the model may consider this particular valley shape or its finer substructure as less discriminative or sometimes indicative of other classes), so the classifier balances this against the strong positive cues elsewhere.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (frequency domain overall) STFT energy is concentrated at the lowest frequency band across almost the whole timeline with occasional bursts of higher magnitude in that lowest bin (not high-frequency content). SHAP heatmap\u2019s red areas align with this lowest-frequency band. Implication: the model\u2019s attributions are dominated by very low-frequency (long-timescale) structure \u2014 broad waves and envelope shape \u2014 rather than high-frequency transient events. Therefore, slow oscillatory shape (amplitude and phase of broad peaks/troughs) is the main discriminative information for the classifier.",
        "Observation -> Implication: (shape & temporal relation) The sample exhibits a sequence of broad alternating crests and troughs (crest near t\u224865, trough near t\u2248180, crest near t\u2248335, deep trough near t\u2248470, then strong rise to the end). These features are time-dependent (each crest/trough follows the previous with relatively consistent spacing) and show gradually varying amplitude (the late trough is the largest). Implication: the classifier apparently uses the pattern of multiple low-frequency half\u2011cycles and the relative amplitudes (notably the late deep trough combined with prior crests) as a composite signature for label 2 \u2014 i.e., the temporal order and relative magnitudes of these large-scale waves are important for the decision.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u2013160): The series starts at a high value (~+1.7 to +1.8 at t\u22480), then follows a smooth, monotonic descent that crosses the zero line near t\u224880\u201395 and reaches a local trough around t\u2248150\u2013170 at about -1.1 to -1.3. Small high-frequency ripples (amplitude on the order of 0.01\u20130.05) are superimposed on the falling slope. STFT shows the energy for this interval concentrated at the very low frequency band. SHAP heatmap has a red patch in the low-frequency row overlapping this time range. -> Implication: The model treats this early high-to-low transition and its shaped trough as positive evidence for label 2 (minivan). The combination of a large amplitude swing, the smooth low-frequency descent and the trough location are discriminative; micro-ripples modulate confidence but are secondary.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 200\u2013320): After the first trough the series rises smoothly from slightly negative values (around t\u2248210) to a pronounced local peak around t\u2248300\u2013320 at approximately +1.2 to +1.4. The rise is relatively steady (average slope roughly +0.015\u2013+0.02 per time step) and includes a short plateau / small oscillations near the top (minor fluctuations ~0.05\u20130.15). STFT still indicates dominant low-frequency energy; SHAP shows a small negative (blue) contribution near the peak in the low-frequency band. -> Implication: The steady, convex rising segment and the location/magnitude of this peak are interpreted by the model as either neutral or slightly counter-evidence for class 2 (the blue SHAP), so sharp positive peaks here reduce the model's minivan-likelihood compared with the trough features.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 320\u2013470): A steep descent follows the mid peak: the signal falls from ~+1.3 at t\u2248320 to the global minimum ~-1.6 (the most negative value in the series) centered roughly t\u2248430\u2013460. The average slope is steep (~-0.02 to -0.03 per time step). There is a small positive rebound / bump around t\u2248360\u2013380 (a short, ~0.2\u20130.4 amplitude blip) before continuing the fall into the deep trough. STFT shows concentrated low-frequency energy during this interval; SHAP heatmap has one of the strongest red concentrations at the low-frequency row overlapping the trough interval (\u2248420\u2013480). -> Implication: This deep trough together with the preceding steep descent is the strongest positive driver for class 2 in this sample. The model strongly attributes class evidence to the magnitude of the negative extreme and the sharpness of the descent into it; the small rebound is a substructure that slightly modulates attribution but does not overturn it.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 470\u2013576): After the deep trough the series undergoes a steady, relatively rapid recovery from ~-1.6 to about +1.8 at the end of the window (t=576). The rise is smooth and nearly linear on this interval (slope roughly +0.03 per step toward the end), with very low internal volatility. STFT energy remains concentrated at very low frequencies. SHAP indicates modest positive attribution in the low-frequency band toward the end of the series. -> Implication: The pronounced recovery (deep trough followed by a strong rise) reinforces the oscillatory envelope the model uses for classification; the symmetric-like recovery after the trough supports the same class evidence as earlier troughs.",
        "Observation (micro-structure across the series): Throughout the major waves there are finer-scale fluctuations: short-duration bumps, tiny ripples on slopes, and brief positive blips (notably near t\u2248260\u2013285 and t\u2248360\u2013380). These have small amplitude relative to the main oscillation (typically <0.2) and appear as faint, slightly higher-frequency content in the STFT and faint mixed-color pixels in the SHAP heatmap. -> Implication: These micro-structures act as secondary cues that slightly increase or decrease local SHAP values, but the model's classification relies primarily on the low-frequency envelope and the location/magnitude of the main extrema.",
        "Observation (frequency content): The STFT shows almost all signal energy concentrated at very low frequencies (closest to 0 on the plotted frequency axis) with only occasional, weak patches at slightly higher frequencies corresponding to the micro-ripples. There is no sustained high-frequency energy. -> Implication: The classifier uses low-frequency shape (slow, smooth waves, positions of peaks/troughs and their amplitudes) rather than transient high-frequency events to decide for label 2."

      "pattern": [
        "The feature pattern of Sample 28 is: Long, low\u2011frequency silhouette structure with several ordered coarse components corresponding to the vehicle outline from front to rear: (1) Early front region (t\u224830\u2013100) shows a moderate positive amplitude followed by a smooth descent with a small local hump (a front curvature) + (2) Mid\u2011section trough (t\u224880\u2013170) is a broad, shallow negative indentation (mid\u2011body undercut/wheel region) + (3) Central cabin/roof rise (t\u2248200\u2013320) is a smooth, low\u2011frequency ramp up through zero to a sustained plateau with small micro\u2011bumps (roofline/cabin) + (4) Short localized protrusion (t\u2248310\u2013360) is a sharper small peak on the mid\u2011section plateau (distinct outline detail) + (5) Large rear trough (t\u2248380\u2013480) is the deepest, widest negative feature in the series (dominant rear recess) + (6) Terminal steep rise (t\u2248480\u2013576) returns the signal to a high positive level (rear slope/termination).",
        "Temporal dependence and combination: The signal is dominated by slow, smoothly varying components (low\u2011frequency) that are temporally structured\u2014earlier features (front bulge and mid trough) transition into a central roofline rise and then into a very strong rear trough followed by a sustained end rise. The classifier\u2019s attribution (SHAP) concentrates on these low\u2011frequency segments at specific times rather than short high\u2011frequency fluctuations, indicating that the global order and relative amplitudes of these coarse features (front \u2192 mid \u2192 cabin \u2192 rear trough \u2192 rear rise) are used together to form the minivan decision. In other words, it is the combination of shape elements (amplitude, width, and slopes of these low\u2011frequency segments) and their relative positions along the time axis that drives the classification.",
        "The feature pattern of Sample 32 is: Broad low\u2011frequency oscillation (global) (throughout t=0\u2013577) (manifestation: dominant energy concentrated in the lowest STFT bin; smooth long-wavelength sinusoid-like envelope with small superimposed jitter) + Early positive crest (t\u224850\u201390) (manifestation: local maximum \u2248 +0.8\u20131.1 with small ripples) + Intermediate shallow valley (t\u2248140\u2013210) (manifestation: local minimum \u2248 -1.2 to -1.3 with minor micro\u2011fluctuations) + Mid positive crest (t\u2248300\u2013350) (manifestation: rise to \u2248 +0.9\u20131.6 with slight top jaggedness) + Dominant deep trough (t\u2248420\u2013480) (manifestation: largest negative excursion \u2248 -1.9, broad and smooth, strongest SHAP positive attribution) + Final recovery/rise to end (t\u2248480\u2013577) (manifestation: monotonic, relatively steep rise back to +1.6). Together these produce a time\u2011ordered signature of alternating broad crests and troughs (two\u2013three half cycles) where the late deep trough plus surrounding crests are the most discriminative elements for the minivan (label 2) classification.",
        "Overall feature pattern of Sample 58 (Label 2 - minivan):",
        "  - Large low-frequency oscillation with roughly two half-cycles across the 577 time steps: first cycle = early high (t\u22480) \u2192 long descent \u2192 trough (t\u2248150), second cycle = rise \u2192 peak (t\u2248300) \u2192 steep descent \u2192 deep trough (t\u2248430\u2013460) \u2192 strong recovery to end (t\u2248576). The dominant period is long (on the order of a few hundred time steps), consistent with concentrated STFT energy at very low frequencies.",
        "  - Amplitude structure: extremes are substantial (max \u2248 +1.7\u20131.8, min \u2248 -1.6 to -1.7). Two well-separated negative troughs and one prominent positive peak create an asymmetric oscillatory envelope (the second trough is deeper than the first).",
        "  - Volatility and rate-of-change: slopes are generally smooth; the steepest transitions are the descent into the deep trough (t\u2248320\u2013460) and the final recovery (t\u2248470\u2013576). Local volatility is low overall; only small ripples and brief rebounds appear as higher-frequency microstructures.",
        "  - Temporal dependence / combination: the classification-relevant pattern is the sequence and relative magnitudes of extrema \u2014 an initial high-to-low swing, a mid positive peak, then a pronounced drop to the deepest trough followed by recovery. The model (per SHAP) places strongest positive weight on the low-frequency troughs (particularly the deep trough around t\u2248430\u2013460 and the earlier trough region), and gives weaker or negative weight to the mid-series positive peak. Micro-features (small bumps and ripples) modulate but do not dominate the decision.",
        "  - Interpretation for class assignment: the sample\u2019s characteristic slow, large-amplitude oscillatory envelope with pronounced negative extremes (deep trough(s)) and smooth transitions is the signature pattern the classifier learned to associate with label 2 (minivan). The SHAP heatmap confirms the model attends primarily to the timing and depth of troughs in the very-low-frequency band as the main evidence for this label."

        "Observation (t \u2248 110\u2013220): A pronounced, smooth upward swing from a local minimum near -1.15 (around time step ~110) to a local maximum \u2248 +1.1\u2026+1.3 (around time step ~210). The net amplitude change is large (~2.3\u20132.5 units) over \u2248100 time steps. The rise is mostly monotonic with only small high\u2011frequency ripples (minor fluctuations of a few hundredths to a few tenths) superimposed. -> Implication: This long, high\u2011magnitude, low\u2011curvature rise is the strongest positively attributed feature (red in the SHAP heatmap) and indicates a broad, low\u2011frequency shape change that the model associates with the target class (label 3). The steady, large rate-of-change (~0.02\u20130.03 units per step on average) differentiates it from short sharp spikes and signals a slowly varying large silhouette component in the extracted vehicle outline.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 180\u2013220; subregion inside the rise): Around time steps ~180\u2013220 the trace exhibits a slight shoulder/plateau near the top of the rise \u2014 a small flattening and local micro-oscillations (several small bumps of low amplitude) just before the peak at ~210\u2013220. -> Implication: These subtle substructures (shoulder and low-amplitude oscillations) concentrate SHAP importance (reddest pixels are centered here) and likely give the classifier extra evidence: not only a large upward trend but a characteristic terminal shape (broad top/shoulder) that distinguishes this object class from others with either sharper peaks or smooth monotone rises.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 260\u2013315): A short drop from the peak back to around zero at ~270 followed by a quick upward spike to ~+1.0 at ~314. This segment is briefer (\u224850 time steps) and has a sharper change than the earlier rise (higher local slope during the spike), with small accompanying high\u2011frequency content. -> Implication: The model assigns moderate positive attribution to portions of this region (pale red), implying that brief reversals followed by a recovery/spike reinforce the overall class signal when combined with the earlier broad rise. The STFT shows slightly elevated low-frequency energy here too, consistent with a composite of slow trend + a short transient.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 366\u2013420): A strong, relatively rapid decline from ~+1.0 down to the global minimum near -2.15 (deep trough around ~390\u2013420). This decline is steeper than the earlier rise (greater negative slope) and the trough is both deeper and more prolonged (the curve stays near the minimum for several samples). -> Implication: Although this region contains large magnitude changes, the SHAP heatmap shows a mix of weak positive and some negative contributions (blue patches later). That suggests the deep trough is characteristic of the time series but the model may treat it as neutral or even mildly counter\u2011evidence depending on its exact timing/shape. The STFT shows increased energy at low frequencies during this large excursion, indicating it is a slow, large-scale feature.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u2013110): Initial downward trend from a positive offset (~+1.5 at t=0) crossing zero near ~70 and reaching the local minimum at ~110. The descent is smooth, moderately steep, and shows limited high\u2011frequency jitter. -> Implication: This long-scale initial descent provides context to the later upward swing (the valley-to-peak transition). The combination of an early high starting level followed by a deep valley and then a broad rise is likely an informative silhouette pattern that the classifier uses (in part through the positively attributed mid\u2011segment).",
        "Observation (Frequency domain): The STFT image shows most energy concentrated at very low frequencies (near the bottom of the spectrogram) throughout the series, with occasional localized increases in low-frequency magnitude (notably around the mid-rise and around the large trough). There is little persistent high\u2011frequency energy. -> Implication: The classifier leans on slow, large-scale shape components (low\u2011frequency content) rather than fast oscillatory details. This matches the SHAP emphasis on low\u2011frequency bands in the red regions, reinforcing that broad morphological features (long slopes, shoulders, deep troughs) drive the decision toward label 3.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 157\u2013209): The series shows a sustained, smooth upward ramp from about -0.9 to about +1.0 (\u0394 \u2248 +1.9) over \u224852 time steps; small high-frequency jitter (~\u00b10.05) is superimposed on the rising trend. -> Implication: A strong low-frequency (long-wavelength) rising shape in this window is an important positive contributor to the model's SUV decision (matches red region in SHAP). The STFT confirms dominant energy at very low frequencies here, so the classifier is responding to the broad shape / slope rather than fast oscillations.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 180\u2013209 \u2014 local subwindow inside the above): The slope becomes noticeably steeper compared with the immediate neighbors (shorter interval with larger per-step increase). -> Implication: This accelerated rise (local increase in first derivative) forms a distinguishable substructure (a steep shoulder) that the model treats as a salient shape cue associated with label 3.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 250\u2013280): The curve reaches a peak near +1.4 to +1.6 with a small rounded plateau and a subtle local bump/kink around t \u2248 268\u2013275 (a slight increase then small dip). -> Implication: The high absolute amplitude and the rounded peak substructure provide additional positive evidence (large-scale geometry) for the SUV class; STFT still shows low-frequency dominance, indicating this is a slow, global shape feature rather than a transient oscillation.",

        "Observation (frequency domain overall): The STFT map shows signal energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during the red SHAP time regions (very little high-frequency content anywhere). -> Implication: The classifier relies mainly on slow, large-scale geometric features (low-frequency components, long-duration bulges and troughs) rather than rapid oscillatory behavior to make the SUV decision.",
        "Observation (volatility comparison): The most diagnostic windows (SHAP-red) are low-volatility, smooth, large-amplitude long-wavelength features, whereas the slightly noisier micro-fluctuations across the trace have small or mixed SHAP values. -> Implication: The model emphasizes macro-shape (envelope) features over small noise-like variance when attributing evidence for label 3."

        "Temporal dependence and composition: The series is dominated by slow, large-scale trends (low\u2011frequency content) with small superimposed high\u2011frequency ripples. Key discriminative structure is the valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded peak motif in the mid\u2011section (t\u2248110\u2013220), which the SHAP heatmap marks as the strongest positive contributor. Shorter transients (the post\u2011peak spike and the deep trough) modulate model evidence \u2014 the spike tends to add positive support while the trough contributes mixed or negative evidence depending on exact shape and timing.",
        "Characteristic statistics: The main upward event (t\u2248110\u2013220) exhibits the largest amplitude swing (~+2.3 to +2.5 units) and a moderate average slope (~0.02\u20130.03 units/time step). Volatility is low overall (small local fluctuations) except for a few sharper transitions (notably the spike near t\u2248314 and the descent into the deep trough t\u2248366\u2013420).",

The descent into the trough is relatively smooth and monotonic over ~40\u201360 steps with small high-frequency jitter (small local wiggles ~0.02\u20130.05 amplitude) near the bottom. STFT: increased energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during this window. SHAP: strong red contributions concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows for this time window. -> Implication: The model attributes this low-frequency, moderately deep trough as a positive cue for the (predicted) class \u2014 it treats a sustained, smooth negative excursion of this magnitude as evidence for that class. The small jitter at the trough bottom contributes little relative to the dominant low-frequency shape.",
        "Observation (time ~240\u2013320): The signal is in a rising phase moving from negative toward a pronounced positive peak. The slope is relatively steep over ~40\u201380 steps (rate of change larger than around the trough-to-peak elsewhere), passing through zero and reaching values \u2248 +1.0 to +1.5. There is a small plateau/flattening near the very top (a slight broadening of the crest) and minor micro-fluctuations on the upslope (amplitude ~0.01\u20130.05). STFT: again energy concentrated at the lowest frequencies with slightly elevated energy in the very-low-frequency band during the upslope. SHAP: red cells concentrated at the bottom frequency rows over this rising window. -> Implication: The model finds the combination of a pronounced positive crest and the preceding steep rising slope at low frequency to be supportive evidence for the predicted label (it treats a wide, high-amplitude crest following a steep rise as characteristic).",
        "Observation (time ~300\u2013370, strongest ~340\u2013360): A local positive peak/crest reaches the global positive amplitude range \u2248 +1.4\u2013+1.5 and shows a short plateau/flattened top with subtle internal oscillation (tiny local bumps) before descending. This peak is one of the signal's largest positive excursions. STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during the peak. SHAP: the most intense red pixels align with this peak at the lowest-frequency rows. -> Implication: The model heavily weights this particular high positive amplitude, low-frequency peak as a strong indicator for its predicted class. The plateaued crest shape (broad top) likely increases its saliency relative to a narrow spike.",
        "Observation (time ~400\u2013460): The series descends to the deepest trough found in the sample (amplitude \u2248 -1.6 to -1.7 around ~420\u2013440). The descent and ascent around this trough are smooth and extended (wide basin), with the trough noticeably deeper than the earlier trough near ~110\u2013120. STFT: prominent lowest-frequency content while in this trough. SHAP: modest red and some blue patches near this trough region at low frequencies (mixed attribution). -> Implication: The unusually deep second trough creates competing evidence: parts of it push the model toward the predicted class (red low-frequency cells) while other sub-structures (slightly different curvature or micro-fluctuations) provide negative evidence. Overall the model appears sensitive to trough depth and width as an attribute.",
        "Observation (global low-frequency dominance): Across all the highlighted windows, the STFT shows virtually all significant energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency band (bottom rows). High-frequency bands are near-zero. SHAP heatmap red areas are likewise concentrated at these lowest-frequency rows. -> Implication: The model's attributions are driven primarily by very low-frequency/long-timescale features (broad peaks and troughs, slope durations), not by high-frequency texture. Therefore classification decisions hinge on amplitude and coarse shape rather than fine-scale noise.",
        "Observation (local substructure differences): The two main positive peaks (start and ~340\u2013360) reach similar positive amplitude (~+1.4\u2013+1.6), but the troughs differ: earlier trough shallower (~-1.1 to -1.25), later trough deeper (~-1.6 to -1.7). Volatility (local high-frequency variance) is low and fairly consistent across the series; micro-jitter is small. -> Implication: The model likely uses asymmetry between peak and trough magnitudes (especially the deep later trough) as discriminative cues. Because these coarse amplitude asymmetries align with what the model learned for the predicted class, they produce positive SHAP attribution even when the true label is different.",
        "Observation (SHAP negative contributions): Sparse blue patches appear in the SHAP heatmap at low frequencies in some time windows (lighter blue near mid-sections). These correspond to features that push the model away from the predicted label. -> Implication: The classifier does consider counter-evidence (parts of the waveform that do not match the predicted prototype), but the net sum of low-frequency positive cues (red) outweighs negatives, which leads to the final (incorrect) decision.",
        "Obs (t \u2248 80\u2013130): A smooth, relatively low-volatility falling segment from about +0.3 down to the first deep trough near \u22121.1 to \u22121.25. The descent is gradual but sustained (a clear low-frequency downward trend) with only very small high-frequency jitter (tiny local bumps \u2248 \u00b10.02\u20130.05). Implication: This extended negative excursion (low-frequency, large-amplitude trough) aligns with a strong red region in the SHAP heatmap at very low frequency \u2014 the model treats this prolonged trough as a positive indicator for the predicted class (contributes toward class 3).",

The signal shows a noticeable acceleration in slope around t\u2248200 (rate-of-change increases compared with the preceding descent) and small local sub-peaks / bumps near t\u2248210\u2013220. Implication: SHAP shows strong positive (red) attribution at low frequencies through this rising transition, so the model uses the trough\u2192rise pattern (the recovery/zero-crossing and onset of upward momentum) as additional evidence for the predicted label.",

The rise into the peak is relatively steep (higher instantaneous slope than the earlier fall), and the peak contains small internal structure (a slight dip ~t\u2248260 followed by a sharper spike to the local maximum). Implication: Time\u2013frequency image shows increased low-frequency energy during this interval and the SHAP heatmap has positive (red) low-frequency attribution here. The model interprets the combination of a deep preceding trough followed by a high positive peak as a strong class-3 cue.",
        "Obs (t \u2248 300\u2013340): A moderate decline from the positive peak toward near-zero, with slightly increased short-scale fluctuations compared to earlier intervals. Implication: SHAP attribution here is close to neutral or slightly negative in places \u2014 this segment does not strongly support the predicted class and begins to counterbalance earlier positive evidence.",

This downturn is relatively smooth but steeper in magnitude than the first trough, and displays low volatility (few high-frequency wiggles). Implication: The SHAP heatmap shows localized blue (negative) attribution at low frequencies around this time window. That means this large negative excursion reduces support for the predicted class (it is evidence against class 3 in the model's internal logic).",
        "Obs (global low-frequency dominance): Across the whole sequence the STFT shows energy concentrated in the very-low-frequency band (near zero frequency) with intermittent bursts coinciding with the large troughs and peaks. High-frequency content is minimal. Implication: The model appears to rely primarily on slow, large-scale shape features (broad troughs and peaks) rather than high-frequency texture \u2014 SHAP red regions line up with these slow changes, indicating the classifier weights low-frequency patterns heavily when assigning class scores.",
        "Obs (competing evidence & logits): The logit values for class 0 (\u2248 0.998) and class 3 (\u2248 1.188) are close (margin \u2248 0.19). Implication: The sample contains mixed cues: early trough\u2192rise\u2192peak (positive SHAP) pushes toward class 3, while the later deeper trough (negative SHAP) pushes away from class 3. Because the positive low-frequency evidence earlier dominates slightly, the model outputs class 3 but with low confidence margin \u2014 this is a borderline / ambiguous classification."

Overall implication: the classifier prioritizes slow, large-amplitude shape transitions (first trough\u2192rise\u2192peak) as evidence for class 3; later opposing trough reduces that evidence but not enough to change the predicted label, hence a low-margin misclassification."

Volatility is low-frequency (smooth) with small high-frequency jitter superimposed. STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during this interval. SHAP: strong red at the lowest-frequency band overlapping this interval.

Shape: broad rounded peak (not sharp), low volatility. STFT: persistent energy in the lowest-frequency bin, little mid/high-frequency content.

STFT: low-frequency energy concentrated at the bottom bins, small transient increase at very low nonzero bins near the end windows. SHAP: red patches at the lowest frequency bins aligned with the late rising segment and peak.

Implication: That local shape provides negative contribution to class 0 \u2014 i.e., that subfeature decreases evidence for the sedan label (and therefore increases relative evidence for other classes, like pickup).

On the raw trace this maps to the smooth upward crossing from negative toward positive values (amplitude roughly from ~-0.2 up to ~+0.8) and the initial part of the subsequent rise toward the local peak at ~260. The local shape is a moderately steep, smooth upward slope with small high-frequency jitter superimposed. Implication: The model treats this broad, low-frequency rise (a slow envelope increase / zero-crossing and shoulder) as a positive indicator for the predicted SUV class \u2014 i.e., the model attributes high importance to slow, large-scale upward shape changes in this window.",
        "Observation: A concentrated red patch also appears slightly earlier (~140\u2013170) at the same very-low frequency band (small but visible). On the time series there is a transition from a valley (near -1 to -0.6) into a smoother rising trend. This substructure shows a gentle curvature (concave up) preceding the faster rise. Implication: The model gives additive positive weight to the concave-up pre-rise substructure; it likely views the sequence of valley + smooth rebound as characteristic for the predicted class and reinforces the main positive contribution centered at ~200.",

The trough is broad and smooth (low-frequency), with a clear local minimum and a gradual recovery afterwards. Implication: The model considers this deep trough evidence against the predicted SUV label (reduces SUV logit). That negative attribution suggests the trough is a feature more consistent with non-SUV classes (or at least contradicts the features the model uses to signal SUV), but its negative weight was insufficient to overturn the positive indications elsewhere.",
        "Observation: Late in the sequence (~500\u2013576) the signal shows a sustained, fairly steep rise from around -0.4 up to a high positive plateau (~+1.7). The STFT shows modest low-frequency energy there; the SHAP map shows mostly neutral to slight blue in that late window (not strongly red). Implication: Although this large-amplitude late rise is a visually salient and class-discriminative-looking feature, the model did not strongly treat it as a positive cue for SUV in this sample (weak/neutral or slightly negative SHAP). This suggests the model prioritizes the earlier envelope shape (~180\u2013220) over the terminal rise for its SUV decision.",
        "Observation: The STFT (time-frequency) is dominated by energy at the lowest frequency bins throughout the trace, with occasional localized increases in low-frequency energy around the same time windows mentioned above (not much energy at higher frequencies). Implication: The classifier appears to be driven primarily by slow envelope (low-frequency) shape features (broad rises and falls) rather than high-frequency oscillatory details. This low-frequency dominance explains why broad shoulders and troughs (not fast texture) carry the largest SHAP weights.",
        "Observation: Small, higher-frequency jitters and short oscillations are visible in the raw series (fine irregularities on the slope segments) but coincide with near-zero-to-light colors in the SHAP heatmap (little attribution) and little energy in mid/high STFT bands.

        "Observation (t \u2248 157\u2013209): A sustained, low-frequency positive bulge: signal rises from near 0 to ~0.5\u20130.9 and forms a gently undulating plateau with small high-frequency ripples superimposed. Volatility is low (slow changes), rate of change is small-to-moderate, shape is rounded with minor local bumps. Implication \u2192 The SHAP heatmap shows a strong red band at the lowest frequency here, so the model treats this broad positive mid-segment bulge as evidence for the predicted class (class 0). Because this feature is long and smooth it dominates low\u2011frequency representation in STFT and biases the classifier toward examples in the training set that share a similar slow positive mid\u2011segment.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 261\u2013300): A relatively sharp upward transient: around the 261 mark the signal jumps from ~0 to a narrow peak near ~1.2\u20131.4 (short duration relative to the broad cycles), forming a single-peaked, triangular/acute substructure with a higher instantaneous slope on ascent and a fast decline afterward. Implication \u2192 The SHAP map shows localized red support at the lowest frequency band during this interval (though energy is concentrated at very low frequency overall). The model interprets this sudden positive transient as further positive evidence for class 0; i.e., it treats the transient peak as characteristic rather than as an outlier. The high ascent/descent rates in this short window are audible in the waveform but do not create strong higher-frequency STFT energy, so they are absorbed into the low-frequency attribution.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 314\u2013418): A large, slow negative trough: the sequence falls from a preceding positive/near-zero level down to a deep trough around \u22122.2 (maximum negative amplitude) and then recovers gradually. The descent and recovery are both relatively long (tens of timesteps) producing a broad V/U shaped basin with small internal wiggles. Volatility here is higher in absolute amplitude but remains dominated by low frequency (slow change). Implication \u2192 Despite being a strong negative excursion in the signal, the SHAP heatmap still shows positive (red) attribution at the lowest frequency band overlapping this interval. This means the model treats the presence of a large slow trough (the overall envelope shape) as supportive of the predicted class 0 \u2014 the classifier relies on large-scale envelope shapes rather than the sign of the amplitude alone. In other words, the model is sensitive to the presence of pronounced, low-frequency cycles (peaks and deep troughs) as a pattern associated with class 0.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 470\u2013560): A steady, low-frequency rise to a high positive plateau (~1.0\u20131.5) with a small intermediate dip (~0.3) around t\u2248520. Trend is strongly upward then leveling; volatility is low once plateaued. Implication \u2192 The SHAP heatmap again shows red concentration at the lowest frequency for this late positive segment, so this final broad rise and plateau contributes positively to the predicted class. The late rising envelope reinforces the model's low-frequency-based decision boundary toward class 0.",
        "Observation (frequency domain overall): STFT indicates almost all energy concentrated at the very lowest frequency bins (very slow oscillations); there is very little mid/high-frequency content throughout the entire sample. Implication \u2192 The model and SHAP both emphasize very-low-frequency components; therefore discrimination is driven by envelope shape (broad cycles, amplitude of peaks/troughs and timing) rather than by transient high-frequency signatures. This explains why broad similar envelopes (even if they contain sign differences, e.g., deep troughs vs peaks) push the prediction in the same direction."

        "Feature pattern of Sample 34 (model prediction: 0 (sedan), true label: 3 (SUV) per dataset background):",
        "1) Dominant slow/low-frequency envelope (0\u2013576): The series is characterized by several broad low-frequency cycles (initial fall to a moderate trough around t\u224880, a mid positive bulge t\u2248157\u2013209, a short positive spike t\u2248261\u2013300, a large slow negative trough t\u2248314\u2013418, and a final rise to a high positive plateau t\u2248470\u2013560). STFT confirms energy is concentrated at the lowest frequency bins, and SHAP attribution is concentrated in those same low-frequency bins (heatmap red) across multiple time windows. Interpretation: the classifier heavily weights global envelope shape (long, slow oscillations) when assigning class probabilities.",
        "2) Localized discriminative substructures (varied times): There are both sharp transients (e.g., the triangular peak near t\u2248261\u2013300) and very broad trough/peak structures (e.g., the deep trough t\u2248314\u2013418). However, because these are represented primarily as slow changes in the STFT, they are treated similarly by the model. The SHAP map shows red (positive) contributions for multiple of these low-frequency events (t\u2248157\u2013209, t\u2248261\u2013314, t\u2248366\u2013418, t\u2248471\u2013523), indicating the model aggregates these low-frequency signatures as aligned with class 0.",
        "3) Volatility and shape comparison across periods: Mid-segment (157\u2013209) vs late-segment (470\u2013560) both show smooth positive envelopes but differ in amplitude (late segment reaches higher peak). The large trough (314\u2013418) has greater absolute amplitude and larger slope magnitudes but still maps to low-frequency energy; SHAP still marks it as positive for the predicted class. This shows the model\u2019s pattern matching is based on presence and timing of broad cycles rather than sign or fine-grained transient detail.",
        "Overall combined implication for misclassification: The model prioritizes low-frequency envelope features (broad bulges, troughs and plateaus) that in the training data are predictive of class 0. Because sample 34 contains multiple such broad low-frequency components at times where SHAP is strongly red, the classifier\u2019s evidence accumulates in favor of class 0 even though the ground-truth class is 3. The near-tie in logits between class 0 and class 3 (1.8295 vs 1.7411) indicates the model was uncertain; the low-frequency envelope cues ultimately tipped the decision toward class 0."
