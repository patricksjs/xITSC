The descent is broad (low curvature) and relatively steady (moderate negative slope). Volatility is low overall but there are tiny high-frequency ripples concentrated at the trough bottom (small amplitude jitter ~0.01\u20130.05). STFT: energy at the lowest frequency bin, very little mid/high-frequency power.\\n  - t = 120\u2013220: recovery from the early trough: gradual rise through zero up to low positive values. The slope here is gentle and steady with low volatility and no sharp spikes. STFT continues to show low-frequency dominance.\\n  - t = 220\u2013320: continued ascent to a pronounced broad positive peak roughly centered ~260\u2013300 reaching about +1.4\u2026+1.6. The peak is rounded with a short plateau/shoulder and small micro-fluctuations on top (low-amplitude wiggles). Rise rate here is noticeably steeper than the earlier descent (positive slope larger in magnitude than the start-down slope). STFT: low-frequency amplitude increases aligned with this window.\\n  - t = 320\u2013440: sharp descent from the mid peak through zero to the global trough near t\u2248410\u2013430 at about -1.6 to -1.75. This is one of the steepest slopes in the series; the trough is narrower and deeper than the first trough and again shows minimal high-frequency noise (mostly smooth). STFT: concentrated energy in the lowest frequency bin during the descent and trough.\\n  - t = 440\u2013576 (end): steady, fairly linear recovery from the deep trough back to a high positive plateau near +1.5\u2026+1.65 at the sequence end. The rise is sustained and smooth, with small bumps on the leading edge of the terminal plateau. Volatility is low during the plateau; STFT shows low-frequency energy concentrated at the bottom band.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal relationships:\\n  - Dominant behavior: the series is dominated by very-low-frequency, long-wavelength oscillation (roughly two large half-cycles across 577 points) with most STFT energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin and only faint high-frequency content at extrema. The waveform: initial high \u2192 broad first trough (~t=80\u2013120) \u2192 strong mid positive plateau (~t=200\u2013300) \u2192 deep trough (~t=340\u2013440) \u2192 sustained final rise/plateau to end.\\n  - Amplitudes: peaks near +1.5\u2013+1.65, troughs down to roughly -1.6 to -1.75 (second trough is the deepest). The sequence exhibits asymmetric slopes: some descents (especially into the deep trough) are steeper than rises, while the final recovery is a sustained gradual climb.\\n  - Volatility: low overall; micro-structure appears as small ripples concentrated at the tops and bottoms of major lobes. These are visible in the time plot but are minor compared to the low-frequency envelope; STFT confirms little mid/high-frequency power.\\n  - Temporal dependence / composition: the classifier-like pattern here is a trough \u2192 slow recovery \u2192 broad positive plateau \u2192 sharp descent \u2192 deep trough \u2192 long recovery to a final high. The timing and relative sizes of the broad lobes (locations of troughs and plateaus) are the key, with small fine-scale ripples only modestly modulating the signal.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching against label feature summaries (which label best fits?)\\n  - Match with label 0 (sedan): Very high correspondence. The provided label_0 description emphasizes: dominant low-frequency lobes, early trough around t\u224880\u2013140, a broad positive peak around t\u2248200\u2013300 with a short plateau and small top-of-crest wiggles, a deeper sharper trough near t\u2248340\u2013440, and a final sustained positive plateau to the end. The test sample matches this sequence and timing closely, including amplitude ranges, low volatility, and STFT low-frequency concentration. => similarity = 4 (high).\\n  - Match with label 1 (pickup): Partial overlap (both classes use low-frequency trough\u2192rebound motifs), but pickup descriptions emphasize a particularly strong mid-sequence steep ascent and a large trough-to-end rebound being the main positive cues; the pickup SHAP emphasis was often on the later recovery as the discriminative event. Our sample does have a late recovery, but the mid positive plateau + microstructure and the exact timing/shape match label 0 more closely than the pickup prototypes. Pickup-like asymmetries exist but are weaker here. => similarity = 2 (low).\\n  - Match with label 2 (minivan): Some similarities exist (dominant low-frequency energy, a deep late trough and strong recovery to end). Label_2 also stresses a set of alternating crests/troughs with a dominant deep trough in the late window, which this sample has. However, minivan descriptions often show a mid hump of lower amplitude (~+0.9\u20131.2) rather than the higher-amplitude +1.5 plateau our sample exhibits; SHAP emphasis for minivan is strongly on the deep late trough as primary evidence, while our series shows strong positive attribution around both the mid plateau and earlier trough\u2192rise sequence consistent with sedan. => similarity = 3 (moderate).\\n  - Match with label 3 (SUV): Label_3 emphasizes a long, high-amplitude valley\u2192broad rise/shoulder around t\u2248110\u2013220 as the main positive contributor. Our sample does have a broad mid rise around 200\u2013300, but the precise shape and the presence of two full long cycles with the deep later trough and final plateau align better with label_0. Additionally, label_3 often shows a very deep later trough that is sometimes neutral for SUV; here the mid plateau + final plateau combination is more sedan-like. => similarity = 2 (low).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Reference-sample cross-check and final decision verification:\\n  - Visual comparison to provided 'similar' reference samples: samples 36, 20 and 26 (all labeled 0) are visually extremely close to the test sample \u2014 same overall envelope, same timing and amplitude of the first trough, mid positive plateau and late deep trough, and similar micro-ripples. That supports the sedan assignment strongly. Sample 7 (label 3) looks similar in the broad shape in places but has slightly different mid-shoulder timing and some extra microstructure; the labeled-3 references are less tight matches than the labeled-0 references. The dissimilar examples (samples 51 and 59) contain additional mid-segment spikes or different amplitude relationships and are not better matches.\\n  - Fairness and scoring logic: I gave the highest match score (4) to label 0 because the sample reproduces nearly all distinctive features from the label_0 description: early trough ~80\u2013140, broad positive peak ~200\u2013300 with short plateau and micro-wiggles, deepest trough ~340\u2013440 that is narrower/sharper than the first trough, and a final sustained positive plateau. The other labels share some low-frequency traits but differ on which local events are most diagnostic and on amplitude/shape specifics; so they were scored lower (label_2 moderate, labels_1 & 3 low).\\n\\nConclusion (final classification): label 0 (sedan). Rationale summary: the sample is dominated by very-low-frequency lobes with the exact sequence and timing of trough\u2192rise\u2192rounded peak\u2192deep trough\u2192final plateau described in the sedan (label 0) pattern and matches multiple reference label-0 samples almost identically.

Volatility: very low; only small high-frequency ripples (tiny wiggles) at the trough bottom.\\n- t \u2248 120\u2013220: Gradual reversal and steady upward ramp from ~-1.2 through zero to positive values. The rise is smooth with small superposed micro\u2011bumps around inflection points. Overall low-frequency energy increases in this window.\\n- t \u2248 220\u2013320: Reaches a pronounced broad positive peak/plateau in the +1.0 to +1.6 range (peak around t\u2248260\u2013300).

The final rise is sustained and nearly monotonic with low volatility; small bumps appear on the rising flank and near the late peak.\\n- Frequency observations (STFT): Energy is concentrated almost entirely in the lowest frequency band across the whole record; occasional increases in the lowest bin align with the major rises and troughs. Very little mid/high-frequency energy is present (only faint spikes at extrema).

Amplitude range \u2248 +1.6 to -2.0.\\n- Volatility is low overall; small high-frequency ripples are limited to extrema and inflection points and do not change the dominant envelope.\\n- Temporal dependencies: the classifier-like cues are the timing and ordering of events: (1) an early broad trough followed by (2) a sustained, rounded positive plateau and then (3) a steep descent to a very deep trough and finally (4) a long recovery to a terminal plateau.

While sample 12 has troughs and recoveries, the midrise in 12 is smoother and the strongest positive evidence in the label_1 description is a sharper, steeper mid-ascent and specific timing that is less pronounced here. Moderate-to-low match.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary often highlights a very deep late trough and strong recovery to the end; some minivan references also show multiple crests/troughs similar to this sample. There is partial overlap (deep late trough + final recovery) but label_2 descriptions put even more emphasis on mid\u2011section hump shapes and different relative weighting of extrema.

Sample 12 does have a rounded mid-peak, but the presence of the very deep late trough and the particular sequence of features matches label_0 better.

Rough per-label similarity reasoning used for verification (see next step) \u2014 label0:4, label1:2, label2:3, label3:2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The three provided 'similar' reference plots for label 0 (Samples 13, 54, 20) exhibit nearly identical envelopes: early high \u2192 broad trough near t\u2248100\u2013130 (~-1.1 to -1.3) \u2192 sustained mid positive peak around t\u2248260\u2013300 (+1.2 to +1.6) \u2192 deep late trough near t\u2248410\u2013430 (~-1.6 to -2.0) \u2192 final recovery to +1.5\u20131.7.

Sample 12 matches these reference traces convincingly in timing, amplitude, shape and frequency content.\\n- The 'dissimilar' references are labeled 2 and show more irregular multi-peaked shapes and/or higher relative high-frequency content or different amplitude relationships; they do not better explain sample 12 than the label-0 references.\\n- Consistency check: The detailed local windows, overall envelope, and STFT evidence consistently point to the same canonical pattern described for label 0 in the summary document.

Dominant period is long (hundreds of steps) so STFT energy is concentrated at near-zero frequencies.\\n - Volatility: low overall. Only small, localized high-frequency ripples are present at peaks/troughs and inflection points; they are minor compared to the low-frequency envelope.\\n - Important composite relationships: the classifier (and human inspection) should consider the ordered sequence of events \u2014 the mid-sequence positive plateau followed by a deeper and wider late trough and then a strong final rebound. The deepest negative excursion occurs late (around t\u2248420) and is paired with a sustained recovery to a high positive endpoint; this pairing (deep trough + long recovery) is a salient composite signature in the sample.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 mapping to label feature summaries and initial similarity scoring:\\n I compared the observed features against the four label descriptions provided in the reference summaries:\\n - Label 0 (sedan): key traits are dominant low-frequency lobes with positive plateaus near mid-to-late sections and emphasis on sustained positive plateaus (evidence often concentrated around ~150\u2013360). Many sedan examples show mid positive plateaus and final rises. Sample 28 does share several sedan-like traits (mid positive plateau near 260\u2013300, final high), so there is moderate similarity. Initial similarity to label 0 = 3/4.\\n - Label 1 (pickup): characterized by strong trough\u2192sharp rebound structure with emphasis on a pronounced mid trough and a very steep rebound window (often strong attribution around trough-to-recovery at ~418). Pickups often show a steep midrise and particular timing differences; sample 28 does have big trough/recovery behavior but not the exact shape-asymmetry and timing emphasized for pickups. Similarity to label 1 = 2/4.\\n - Label 2 (minivan): description stresses a sequence of broad low-frequency crests/troughs with a dominant deep rear trough centered in the mid-late window (~420\u2013470) and the model strongly attributing the deep late trough and the subsequent monotonic recovery to the minivan label. That matches sample 28 very closely: deep trough \u2248 -1.8 to -1.95 at \u2248420, wide trough, and a strong, smooth recovery to +1.5 at the end; STFT shows near-zero frequency dominance. Similarity to label 2 = 4/4.\\n - Label 3 (SUV): emphasis on a long, high-amplitude low-frequency upward ramp in the mid-section (a broad rising shoulder/rounded peak around ~110\u2013220 and strong mid-rise) with the model largely attributing the mid-rise/shoulder to the SUV class. Sample 28 has a mid-rise but the most diagnostic feature is the deep late trough and final recovery rather than the mid-rise shoulder being uniquely discriminative. Similarity to label 3 = 2/4.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 rechecking with reference samples and final decision:\\n - The four provided 'similar' reference plots (all labelled 0.0 in the supplied list) are visually close to sample 28 in that they share the overall low-frequency multi-lobe envelope and mid positive peaks and deep late troughs. That supports why sample 28 could be confused with label 0 (sedan). However the label_2 feature summary explicitly highlights the very large, late deep trough (~-1.7 to -1.9) and the classifier\u2019s reliance on that trough + recovery as the primary evidence for minivan; sample 28 contains that exact hallmark (deep trough at \u2248420 with strongest magnitude and subsequent recovery). The 'dissimilar' examples include one labelled 2.0 and one labelled 1.0; the label-2 dissimilar example (sample 37) shares the deep late trough trait but shows additional earlier small peaks and slightly different relative amplitudes \u2014 nevertheless it confirms that deep trough + large recovery is a minivan signature in training set.\\n - Comparing the textual label summaries against the measured amplitudes, slopes and timing in sample 28 yields the closest match to label 2 (minivan): the late, deepest trough is the strongest single discriminative event in the sample and this is called out repeatedly in the label_2 description as the primary positive cue.\\n\\nFinal classification and justification:\\n - Chosen label: label 2 (minivan).\\n - Chosen score (degree of similarity to that label): 4 (high similarity).

Amplitude falls from ~+1.5 toward ~0; moderate negative slope (~-0.01 to -0.02 unit/step). Volatility low (very small high-frequency ripples only). STFT: low-frequency energy present at bottom bin.\\n- t = 80\u2013140: broad, smooth trough centered ~100\u2013120 reaching approximately -1.05 to -1.25. Shape: wide U-like trough with small micro\u2011wiggles at the bottom (low amplitude). Rate of change into and out of trough is gradual; volatility remains low. STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest frequency band during this window.\\n- t = 140\u2013220: steady upward transition from negative through zero into positive. Rise is relatively continuous and gains amplitude up to ~+0.6\u2013+1.0 by ~220. Low volatility; STFT shows increased energy in the lowest-frequency bins during the ramp.\\n- t = 220\u2013320: reaches a broad rounded peak / plateau region centered ~260\u2013300 with amplitude about +1.3 to +1.6. The peak has a short flattened top with tiny superposed bumps (microstructure). Change rates here are small (near-zero slope on the plateau). STFT still dominated by very-low-frequency content; only faint high-frequency content on the tiny top ripples.\\n- t = 320\u2013420: relatively steep descent from the mid-peak down to the global trough. The descent accelerates approaching the trough; average negative slope larger in magnitude than earlier slopes. Small intermediate local bumps visible around 320\u2013360 but overall low volatility.\\n- t = 420\u2013440: global trough centered ~420\u2013430 reaching roughly -1.7 to -1.85 (deepest point). Shape: narrower and slightly sharper than the earlier trough but still smooth; small micro-ripples on the flanks. STFT: again strong low-frequency magnitude at these times.\\n- t = 440\u2013576: sustained recovery from the deep trough back to a high positive plateau by the series end (~+1.5). The rise from trough to end is long and smooth, average positive slope ~+0.02\u2013+0.03; volatility low. Final segment shows a gentle plateau near the end with tiny bumps. STFT indicates persistent energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin across this interval.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature analysis and temporal dependencies:\\n- Dominant low-frequency / long-period envelope: The whole trace is dominated by two main slow oscillatory cycles (roughly two large half-cycles across 577 points). STFT confirms almost all measurable energy is in the lowest frequency band \u2014 the series is a slowly varying silhouette rather than a high-frequency/noisy trace.\\n- Key extrema and timing: first broad trough (~100\u2013120), strong rounded mid positive plateau (~260\u2013300), deepest trough (~420\u2013430), and final steady rise to end (~520\u2013576). The ordering trough \u2192 slow rise \u2192 rounded positive plateau \u2192 steep descent \u2192 deep trough \u2192 long recovery is the principal temporal pattern.\\n- Volatility and microstructure: overall volatility is low; main microstructure consists of small amplitude ripples concentrated at peaks/trough flanks and a few brief small local bumps on plateaus. These are minor compared to the large low-frequency lobes.\\n- Slope asymmetry: some rises are gentler and descents into the deep trough are relatively steeper \u2014 the asymmetry between rising and falling flanks is consistent across cycles.\\n- Combination/temporal dependence: classifier\u2011relevant information is the sequence and relative amplitudes of these broad lobes (positions and magnitudes of troughs and plateaus), not transient high-frequency spikes. The long recovery after the global trough functions as confirming evidence for the overall envelope pattern.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to provided label feature lists (qualitative match):\\n- Label 0 (sedan): The sample matches the sedan description very closely: early broad trough at ~80\u2013140 with small ripples, a large rounded positive plateau around ~200\u2013300 (~+1.3\u2013+1.6), a deeper central/trailing trough near ~420 at ~-1.7, and a final long rise to ~+1.5 at the end. Low-frequency dominance, low volatility, micro-ripples at extrema, and the temporal order of trough \u2192 slow rise \u2192 plateau \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery all align with the label 0 pattern. (Similarity: 4/4 \u2014 high.)\\n- Label 1 (pickup): Pickup descriptions emphasize deep trough + a sharp, relatively fast rebound and strong positive SHAP at the recovery; sample shares some of these elements (deep trough near 420 and long recovery). However, pickup summaries emphasize a particularly strong mid-sequence steep ascent and slightly different timing/attribution emphasis. Our sample\u2019s mid-rise is more rounded and its overall temporal pattern and microstructure match label 0 more closely. (Similarity: 2\u20133/4 \u2014 low-to-moderate.)\\n- Label 2 (minivan): Minivan patterns also feature a late deep trough and strong low-frequency energy. Differences: label 2 descriptions often call out a distinctive early front hump, mid hump and a particular shape of the rear trough being the strongest cue; while there is overlap, the specific timing and plateau shapes in this test sample are more consistent with label 0 examples and the provided minivan reference had some differing mid-structure. (Similarity: 2/4 \u2014 low.)\\n- Label 3 (SUV): SUV descriptions focus on a long, high-amplitude mid-section rise/shoulder (valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded peak) as the strongest cue. Our sample does show a broad mid rise, but the full sequence of extrema and the particular trough depths/timings align better with label 0. Also the provided SUV examples had slightly different shapes (e.g., more prominent shoulder in the mid-rise). (Similarity: 2/4 \u2014 low.)\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four provided 'similar' reference samples (samples labeled 42, 6, 20, 10) are all label 0 and are visually nearly identical in waveform envelope, timing of extrema, amplitudes of troughs/peaks, and low-frequency STFT pattern. The test sample\u2019s waveform is essentially the same canonical pattern shown in those label-0 examples (same positions for the first trough, mid plateau, deep trough, and terminal rise). This strongly supports label 0.\\n- The two dissimilar references (label 2 and label 1) show some shared elements (deep trough and recovery) but have noticeable differences in mid-segment structure and local sub-features (e.g., extra small peaks or faster transient spikes) and thus are less consistent with our test sample.\\n- Given the near one-to-one alignment with the label-0 feature list, the strong agreement with multiple label-0 reference plots, and the STFT confirmation of very-low-frequency dominance at the same time windows, the most accurate classification is label 0 (sedan).\\n\\nFinal similarity quantification (per label, included as verification): label 0 = 4 (high), label 1 = 2 (low\u2013moderate), label 2 = 2 (low), label 3 = 2 (low). The single chosen score returned above (4) refers to the similarity between the sample and the assigned label (label 0).\"\n  ]\n}",

Key extrema: an early trough near t\u2248100 (~ -1.1 to -1.25), a large rounded positive peak near t\u2248270\u2013290 (~ +1.4\u2013+1.7), the deepest trough near t\u2248410\u2013420 (~ -1.8 to -2.0), and a final monotonic recovery to a high positive plateau near +1.5 at the end (t\u2248576).\\n- Trends and slopes: The series starts high then declines into the first trough (moderate negative slope), then rises steadily (t\u2248150\u2013280) with low volatility into a rounded peak, falls more steeply into the deep mid-late trough (t\u2248280\u2013420) and then recovers smoothly and substantially to the final plateau (t\u2248420\u2013576). The rises/peaks are smooth and long-duration (low-frequency), while micro-oscillations are confined to extrema.\\n- Volatility: Low overall; micro-ripples are small amplitude and concentrate at peak/trough flanks. STFT shows almost all energy in the bottom frequency bin, supporting the low-volatility, slowly changing envelope interpretation.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: The classifier appears to use the ordered sequence trough \u2192 steady rise \u2192 broad positive plateau \u2192 steep descent \u2192 deep trough \u2192 final recovery as a coherent signature. The mid-rise + rounded peak (t\u2248150\u2013300) are the most strongly positively attributed features, with the deep trough and the final recovery providing additional context/support. The relative timing (mid-rise followed by deeper late trough) is important.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and scoring (1\u20134):\\n- Label 0 (sedan): High match. The summary for sedans emphasizes dominant very-low-frequency lobes: an early trough (t\u224880\u2013140), a broad mid positive peak/plateau (t\u2248200\u2013300), a deep central/trailing trough (t\u2248340\u2013440), and a final positive plateau at the series end. Sample 31 shows these same components at very similar times and amplitudes: early trough \u2248100, mid plateau \u2248270\u2013290, deepest trough \u2248418, final recovery to \u2248+1.5. SHAP attribution in sample 31 focuses on the same low-frequency bands and mid-window times that sedan summaries flag as discriminative. Therefore similarity = 4 (high similarity).\\n- Label 1 (pickup): Moderate match. Pickup patterns emphasize strong trough\u2192rebound events (notably around t\u2248150\u2013220 and a large recovery from the global trough to the end). Sample 31 has a trough\u2192rise at ~100\u2013220 and a strong final recovery after 420, so there is meaningful overlap. However, pickups in the summary put especially strong positive weight on the later rebound as the primary cue; in sample 31 the strongest SHAP mass sits on the mid-rise/plateau more than purely on the final rebound. Similarity = 3 (moderate).\\n- Label 2 (minivan): Low-to-moderate match. Minivan descriptions emphasize the large rear trough (~t\u2248420\u2013480) as the strongest positive cue; sample 31 does have a deep trough \u2248418 and some positive attribution near that low-frequency time window, but the classifier\u2019s strongest red mass in this sample is on the mid rise/plateau rather than exclusively on the late trough. Also minivan summaries highlight a particular sequence of front bulge \u2192 mid trough \u2192 mid rise \u2192 dominant deep trough \u2192 final rise; while sample 31 shows many of these, the mid positive plateau is more prominent here and the SHAP emphasis aligns more with the sedan pattern. Similarity = 2 (low-to-moderate).\\n- Label 3 (SUV): Moderate match. SUV summaries highlight a long, high-amplitude mid-section rise/shoulder (~t\u2248110\u2013220) with rounded peak and low-frequency dominance \u2014 exactly where sample 31's strongest SHAP is. However, SUVs in the summary sometimes treat the later deep trough as neutral or mildly negative; sample 31\u2019s combination of a strong mid-rise plus a very deep later trough (which in SUV templates is less positively weighted) makes the match imperfect. Similarity = 3 (moderate).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final decision justification:\\n- Visual & attribution consistency with reference 'similar' examples: The provided reference samples labeled 0 (samples 42, 50, 6) are very close in waveform: early trough around ~100, strong mid-rise/rounded peak around ~260\u2013290, deeper trough around ~410\u2013420 and final recovery to +1.5. Their STFTs and SHAP heatmaps also show bottom-row attribution concentrated in the mid-rise and around the trough/recovery windows, mirroring sample 31. This close match in both raw waveform timing/amplitude and in SHAP localization strongly supports label 0.\\n- Contrast to dissimilar references: The dissimilar samples labelled 2 and 1 show different attribution patterns (e.g., label 2's SHAP often highlights the late trough almost exclusively; label 1 emphasizes trough\u2192rebound structure differently). Sample 31\u2019s dominant positive SHAP at the mid-rise plus supporting attribution near the late trough aligns better with the sedan references than with those dissimilar examples.\\n- Fairness and scoring: Given the near one-to-one match of the major low-frequency lobes (timing, amplitude and shape) and the SHAP focus matching the sedan description, assigning label 0 is the fairest interpretation. I scored similarity to label 0 as 4 (high similarity). Pickup (1) and SUV (3) both share some features (mid-rise, trough\u2192rebound) so I scored them at moderate similarity; minivan (2) shares the late deep trough but not the same SHAP-weight pattern, so I scored it lower.\\n\\nFinal answer: label 0 (sedan) with high confidence (similarity score = 4). Per-label similarity (informative, included above) used to check and justify the decision: label0=4, label1=3, label2=2, label3=3.\"\n  ]\n}",

Sample 31 has similar elements but the overall envelope and timing (two-cycle symmetric oscillation with late deep trough and final rise) are more characteristic of the sedan pattern; pickup-specific nuances (e.g., the particular slope asymmetry and timing that pickup SHAP highlights) are weaker here.

Sample 31 does show the large rear/deep trough near ~420 and the final steep rise that minivan summaries highlight; it also shows an earlier mid rise.

Sample 31 has a substantial valley-to-midrise motif in that region and a rounded mid peak which SUV descriptions treat as primary positive evidence. However, SUV patterns sometimes show a slightly different weighting of mid-rise vs later trough in SHAP; sample 31's combination of two large cycles and the late deep trough align more closely to sedan/minivan.

The rise is relatively smooth (low-frequency), the crest shows a short flattening/plateau and small micro-bumps on top. Average slope on the rising limb is positive and consistent (low volatility).\\n- t = 280\u2013340: small correction from the peak toward zero (brief mild fall), then continuation toward the next major descent. Substructure: small fluctuations but no abrupt high-frequency spikes.\\n- t = 340\u2013440: steep, relatively rapid descent into the global trough (deepest point \u2248 -1.6 to -1.8 around \u2248 410\u2013430). The trough is somewhat narrower and deeper than the first trough and again shows only small micro-ripples. Volatility remains low except for the faster slope into the trough.\\n- t = 440\u2013576: long, smooth recovery from the global trough back into a sustained positive plateau at the series end (~+1.4 to +1.6). The final climb is steady, low volatility, with small bumps near the late peak (small local jag). Overall slope positive and sustained to the end.\\n- Frequency-domain (STFT): nearly all energy concentrated at the very lowest frequencies throughout the sequence; occasional small increases in the lowest-frequency bins align with the main lobes/peaks. There is negligible sustained mid/high-frequency energy \u2014 small high-frequency ripples only at extrema.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall sample features and temporal dependencies:\\n- Global structure: a long-wavelength oscillatory envelope with roughly two low-frequency cycles across 577 steps: early high \u2192 broad trough (~100) \u2192 long rise to a rounded mid positive plateau (~250\u2013280) \u2192 steep fall to a deep trough (~410\u2013430) \u2192 steady recovery to a high end-value. The dominant information is low-frequency (coarse silhouette shapes) with micro-ripples only at extrema.\\n- Periodicity & trend: not strictly periodic but shows repeating half-cycles (trough\u2192peak\u2192trough\u2192rise). The envelope is low-frequency (period on order of a few hundred steps) with consistent ordering of features (early trough then mid-peak then late deeper trough then final rise).\\n- Volatility: generally low across the whole series; the most rapid changes are the descent into the global trough (t \u2248 340\u2013420) and the earlier rise (t \u2248 140\u2013280). Micro-oscillations at peaks/troughs are minor and localized.\\n- Feature combination / temporal dependence: the classifier (and a human reader) would emphasize the sequence of (1) initial trough \u2192 (2) smooth, high-amplitude rise to a rounded plateau \u2192 (3) steeper descent to a deep trough \u2192 (4) long rebound to a terminal plateau. The timing, amplitude and widths of these low-frequency lobes (especially the mid positive plateau and the deep late trough plus the final recovery) are the defining composite signal.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists and selection of best label:\\n- Comparison to label 0 (sedan): The provided label_0 description explicitly lists the very same pattern: early trough near t\u224880\u2013140 (\u2248 -1.15), major positive plateau around t\u2248200\u2013300 at \u2248 +1.5, a deeper central/trailing trough around t\u2248340\u2013440 near -1.7, and a final rise to +1.5 at the end. The sample's low-frequency dominance, small extremal ripples, and SHAP-style attribution windows described for label_0 match the sample nearly point-for-point. => Similarity = 4 (high).\\n- Comparison to label 1 (pickup): pickup summaries emphasize deep troughs and strong trough\u2192rebound events (and steep midrise). Sample 33 does contain trough\u2192rebound structure and a steep late descent/recovery, but the pickup description highlights different timing and an asymmetric steep mid-ascent as the core cue. Sample 33 fits some pickup elements but matches label_0 more closely (timing, plateau shapes, and dual-cycle envelope). => Similarity = 2 (low to modest evidence only).\\n- Comparison to label 2 (minivan): minivan descriptions stress a large late deep trough (t\u2248420\u2013470) and a long recovery to the end as key evidence; sample 33 has that late deep trough and final recovery, so there is moderate similarity. However minivan notes other mid-structure (particular early hump/mid crest shapes and how the deep trough is the dominant positive cue) that are present but not as uniquely diagnostic here because the full sequence (early trough, mid plateau, late trough, final rise) aligns better with sedan. => Similarity = 3 (moderate).\\n- Comparison to label 3 (SUV): label_3 focuses on a strong long low-frequency upward ramp/shoulder in the mid-section (t\u2248110\u2013220) as the main positive cue; sample 33 does have a pronounced mid rise and plateau around that time, so there's fair resemblance. But SUV descriptions often pair that mid ramp with a different balance of subsequent substructures (e.g., a short spike and characteristic trough behavior) \u2014 overall sedan still gives the closest match. => Similarity = 3 (moderate).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples and final decision reasoning:\\n- Reference examples: the set of similar references includes multiple label 0 examples (samples 42, 50, 6) that are visually and morphologically almost identical to the test sample: same early trough timing/amplitude, similar mid-peak plateau, same deep late trough around 410\u2013430 and final rise to +1.5. One reference (sample 46) is label 3 and shows a very similar waveform as well, but the published label_0 textual pattern exactly matches the test sample\u2019s ordered lobes and their described SHAP-attributed windows. The dissimilar references (label 3 examples 51 and 18) emphasize slightly different amplitude balances (e.g., larger early-to-mid ramp emphasis or deeper troughs) but still share the low-frequency dominance.\\n- Fairness & scoring: after re-checking the per-label feature lists and the four similar + two dissimilar references, the strongest and most specific match is to label_0 (sedan). Several distinguishing points line up with the label_0 description: first trough around t\u224880\u2013140 at \u2248 -1.15, a sustained rounded positive plateau around t\u2248200\u2013300 at \u2248 +1.5, a deeper sharper trough near t\u2248420 at \u2248 -1.6 to -1.8, and a final recovery to \u2248 +1.5 at the end \u2014 all present in the sample and in the label_0 reference examples. Differences with labels 1\u20133 are smaller and concern emphasis (which half-cycle the model weights most), not absence of features.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 0 (sedan).\\nSimilarity score for chosen label (label 0): 4 (high similarity). \\n(For transparency, per-label similarity I used internally while deciding: label_0 = 4, label_1 = 2, label_2 = 3, label_3 = 3.)\"\n  ]\n}",

The descent is low-volatility (smooth curve) with small high-frequency micro\u2011ripples (very low amplitude wiggles) concentrated at the trough flank. STFT: energy concentrated in the lowest frequency band during this window, only faint higher frequency content at the trough.\\n- t = 120\u2013220: Gradual to steady upward swing from the trough through zero; values rise from ~-1.2 up toward positive values. The slope is steady, low volatility, and shows small superimposed bumps. STFT: low-frequency energy increases slightly across this interval.\\n- t = 220\u2013320: Broad positive peak/plateau centered \u2248 250\u2013290 with amplitude \u2248 +1.3\u2013+1.6. The peak is rounded with a short, slightly flattened top and tiny rapid micro-fluctuations (small bumps) on the crest. Volatility remains low overall; the plateau is sustained for many tens of steps. STFT: clear low-frequency dominance at these times.\\n- t = 320\u2013440: A relatively steep decline from the mid-peak down to the global trough; the fall is the steepest segment of the series and the trough is deeper and somewhat narrower than the first trough. Global minimum occurs around t\u2248410\u2013430 at about -1.65 to -1.85. The trough bottom is smooth with low-amplitude ripples. STFT: strong energy again concentrated in lowest frequency bin; little mid/high-frequency power.\\n- t = 440\u2013576 (end): Smooth, fairly steady recovery back into a final positive plateau ending near +1.5. The rise is sustained with small local bumps near the late peak (micro-fluctuations around t\u2248540). STFT: persistent low-frequency energy; slight bursts at extrema times.\\n- Microstructure summary: At each major extremum there are small, short-lived oscillations but they are minor relative to the broad lobes. STFT and visual inspection confirm the signal is dominated by very-low-frequency content (long timescale envelope) with only faint high-frequency components localized at extrema.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features and temporal dependence:\\n- Dominant characteristics: The series is a low-frequency, oscillatory envelope with roughly two large cycles across 577 steps: trough \u2192 rise \u2192 broad positive peak \u2192 steep fall to deep trough \u2192 final recovery to high positive. This matches a long-wavelength waveform rather than a noisy high-frequency signal.\\n- Periodicity & timing: Two main low-frequency half-cycles with consistent spacing: first trough around 80\u2013120, strong peak around 250\u2013290, deepest trough around 410\u2013430, end plateau thereafter. The timing, amplitude and relative widths of these lobes are key features.\\n- Volatility: Low overall; transitions are smooth. The steepest change is the descent into the global trough (t\u2248320\u2013420). Micro\u2011ripples are present but only as secondary structure at extrema.\\n- Combination relationships: The classifier would naturally combine the early trough + steady recovery + rounded mid-peak + steep subsequent drop + final recovery as a coherent signature. The positive evidence is concentrated on the steady upward segments and sustained plateaus, while the deepest trough acts as a salient low-frequency landmark.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to the provided label feature lists (high-level mapping):\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary highlights: dominant low-frequency lobes with first trough near t\u224880\u2013140 (~-1.15), a broad positive peak near t\u2248200\u2013300 (~+1.3\u20131.6) with a short plateau, a deeper trough near t\u2248340\u2013440 (~-1.6 to -1.85), and a final rise to +1.5 at the end. SHAP emphasis in the reference is on low-frequency envelope features and small micro\u2011ripples at extrema.\\n  Match: The test sample reproduces these elements almost exactly \u2014 same timings, amplitude ranges, shapes (rounded peak with small top wiggles), and the same low-frequency STFT signature. Strong alignment across many specific items -> High similarity.\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary: also emphasizes large trough\u2192rebound patterns and final recovery, but with different emphasis on timing (strong mid-sequence rebound seen as the strongest cue) and slope asymmetries. While the test sample contains trough\u2192rebound events, the exact patterning (timing and shape of the mid-peak and the relative strengths) matches label 0 more closely than label 1.\\n  Match: Some shared attributes (deep trough, recovery) but not the precise pickup-specific timing/asymmetry -> Low-to-moderate similarity.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary: also low-frequency dominated with a very strong deep trough around t\u2248420 and a sustained end rise; however, minivan patterns often show slightly different mid-structure (e.g., central plateau shape and earlier small humps) and the minivan description emphasizes the late trough as the dominant cue. The test sample's mid-peak is stronger and more rounded in the t\u2248250\u2013290 region which is more characteristic of label 0.\\n  Match: Shares some elements (deep late trough + end rise) but mid-peak shape and earlier trough/plateau sequence aligns better with label 0 -> Low-to-moderate similarity.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary: key discriminative element is a long, high\u2011amplitude mid-section upward ramp/shoulder centered roughly t\u2248110\u2013220 and a rounded peak; SUV references also have a pronounced valley\u2192broad rise motif. There is some similarity between SUV and this sample in the presence of a large mid-rise, but the SUV description often highlights a longer smoother rising shoulder starting earlier (and sometimes different trough timing/amplitudes). The available SUV reference (sample 46) is similar in appearance to the test sample, but the set of three label\u20110 references are extremely close matches as well.\\n  Match: Moderate similarity because both have a strong rounded mid-peak and low-frequency dominance, but the exact trough/peak ordering and the particular amplitudes & timings better match label 0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and finalize similarity scoring:\\n- Visual comparison to the four \\\"similar\\\" reference plots labeled 0 (samples 42, 50, 6): The test series matches them closely in all key respects: initial high \u2192 first trough near 80\u2013120 \u2192 broad rounded mid-peak near 250\u2013290 \u2192 steep fall to deep trough near 410\u2013430 \u2192 final recovery to +1.5. Microstructure (small ripples on extrema), amplitude ranges, and STFT low-frequency concentration are essentially the same. This confirms a very strong match with label 0.\\n- Comparison to sample 46 (label 3) and to dissimilar label 3 references (samples 51, 18): those show some shared motifs (broad mid-rise, deep trough later), but differences in exact timing of the early trough/shoulder and in the relative emphasis of the mid-rise vs. trough events make them less precise matches than the label\u20110 references. The label\u20111 and label\u20112 summaries contain overlapping low-frequency trough/rebound language, but their distinctive patterns (pickup's mid-rebound asymmetry; minivan's characteristic early humps and different mid-peak behavior) are not better matches than label 0.\\n- Scoring rationale: Because nearly every distinctive element described in the label_0 feature/pattern list (positions of troughs and peaks, amplitudes, low-frequency dominance, small micro\u2011ripples at extrema, and the temporal order trough\u2192rise\u2192rounded peak\u2192steep fall\u2192final rise) is present in the test sample, this is a high-confidence match. Therefore I assign label 0 and give the chosen-label similarity score = 4 (high similarity).\\n\\nAdditional note: If a finer-grained multi-label similarity vector were required, I would report approximate similarity levels as: label_0 = 4 (high), label_3 = 3 (moderate), label_1 = 2 (low), label_2 = 2 (low). But per output specification the single score returned corresponds to the similarity for the selected label (label 0) and is 4.\"\n  ]\n}",

The fall is the steepest segment in the series; slope magnitude larger than earlier rises. The trough is centered around t\u2248410\u2013430 with amplitude about -1.6 to -1.8.

This sample matches these elements very closely in timing, amplitude, shape and STFT energy. Match level: HIGH.\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary key points: emphasis on deep troughs followed by relatively fast high-amplitude rebounding recoveries, main positive SHAP concentrated around recoveries (notably a strong rebound around ~418\u2013475).

Our sample does include a valley\u2192broad rise in ~110\u2013220 and a rounded midpeak, so it shares SUV-like structure, but SUV notes often emphasize the mid-rise/shoulder as the primary signature and sometimes different post-peak behaviour (e.g., sharper post-peak troughs).

The two dissimilar references (one label 3 with larger negative extremes and one label 1 with somewhat different mid-structures) highlight differences: the dissimilar label-3 example has a much deeper trough amplitude and slightly shifted timing of key lobes; the dissimilar label-1 shows different local bumps and a different mid rise profile. Our sample is more consistent with the label-0 group than with dissimilar examples.\\n- Fairness and scoring logic: scores assigned above reflect (1) exactness of timing and amplitude of the key lobes, (2) similarity of microstructure at extrema, (3) agreement of frequency content (dominant energy at very low frequency), and (4) temporal ordering of features. All four label scores were compared on these bases; label 0 receives the highest score because all four primary low-frequency lobes and their timing/shape are present and match the label-0 description closely.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 (sedan) with similarity score = 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

There is a small patch of negative attribution (blue) around ~t=460\u2013500.\\n- Window A (t \u2248 80\u2013130): the trace descends from near 0 (after the initial fall) to a smooth, broad trough. Amplitude: trough values \u2248 -1.1 to -1.3 (minimum \u2248 -1.25). Shape/volatility: broad concave bottom, very low short-term volatility aside from tiny wiggles of a few hundredths. Rate: the descent is moderate (spread over several tens of steps), i.e. slow low-frequency change. STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest bin in this window. Interpretation: a broad low-frequency negative half-wave (stable trough) that the model marks as positive evidence.\\n- Window B (t \u2248 200\u2013320): the trace climbs from slightly negative values through zero up to a large rounded positive peak centered ~260\u2013300 with amplitude \u2248 +1.4 to +1.6. Shape: a relatively steep low-frequency ascent culminating in a short plateau/rounded crest with small high-frequency jitter on the top. Rate: average slope across the ascent is noticeably higher than the earlier fall (a clear trough\u2192peak rebound over ~100 steps). STFT: very strong low-frequency power aligned with the red SHAP pixels. Interpretation: this trough\u2192sharp low-frequency rebound / high-amplitude positive lobe is a primary positive cue for the classifier.\\n- Window C (t \u2248 520\u2013576): final monotonic rise to a sustained positive end value \u2248 +1.4\u2013+1.5, low volatility, and low-frequency energy \u2014 a consolidating positive plateau that contributes modestly.\\n- Negative region (t \u2248 460\u2013500): SHAP shows slight blue around this segment; the trace here contains a small dip after the deep trough recovery (a short-duration local decrease). This short dip is higher-frequency relative to the main waves and slightly reduces confidence for the positive label but is small compared with the positive rebound evidence.\\n- Overall local finding: all significant red pixels are in the lowest STFT band; higher-frequency bins remain unimportant. The model\u2019s attributions focus on slow, large-amplitude half-cycles (especially trough\u2192peak recoveries) rather than brief spikes or fine texture.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and relationships between events:\\n- Global morphology: two large low-frequency cycles across the 577 points: initial high \u2192 broad descent to trough (~t=80\u2013130), large rebound to mid-series peak (~t=200\u2013320), steep descent to a deep trough (~t\u2248400\u2013420), and a long recovery to a final positive plateau (~t\u2248480\u2013576). Extremes: peaks around +1.4\u2013+1.6 and troughs around -1.6 to -1.3 (the mid/late trough is the deepest). Volatility is low overall: the waveform is smooth with small micro-ripples concentrated near extrema.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: the discriminative pattern is the ordered sequence trough (early) \u2192 strong low-frequency ascent to a high plateau (mid) \u2192 large negative trough (mid-late) \u2192 final long recovery to high end. The classifier (via SHAP) places strongest positive weight on the trough\u2192rebound events (especially the mid rise) and on the long final recovery; isolated short dips are secondary and sometimes slightly negative.\\n- Frequency content: STFT confirms most signal energy is concentrated in the lowest frequency bin across the whole record; this supports that classification uses long-wavelength shape (envelope) features.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and initial similarity scoring (per-label reasoning):\\n- Label 1 (pickup): The pickup summary emphasizes strong low-frequency trough\u2192rise events (notably positive SHAP around ~150\u2013220 in the doc), a steep mid-sequence ascent to a high plateau, and a long recovery from a deep trough to final positive values. Our sample shows the same trough\u2192steep rise to a high plateau (t\u2248200\u2013320) and a final long recovery; SHAP red aligns with exactly those windows. Visual match to the provided similar training samples labeled 1 is very close. Similarity assessment: 4 (High similarity).\\n- Label 0 (sedan): The sedan summary stresses dominant low-frequency lobes and sustained positive plateaus (positive SHAP at plateaus ~150\u2013280 and near the end). Our sample does have low-frequency lobes and positive plateaus, so there is substantial overlap with sedan patterns; however sedan descriptions place more emphasis on smooth broad concave/convex shapes and sometimes treat very deep troughs as neutral/negative. Because our sample\u2019s stronger discriminative events are the trough\u2192rebound pair (pickup signature), the match to sedan is slightly weaker than to pickup. Similarity assessment: 3 (Moderate similarity).\\n- Label 2 (minivan): The minivan summary highlights a very strong deep trough in the late/mid window (with the model giving the deepest red there) and specific front/mid bulges. In our sample the deepest trough near t\u2248400\u2013420 exists, but SHAP red is concentrated on the earlier trough\u2192rebound and mid peak rather than on the late trough (we do not see the strongest red at the late trough). Therefore the sample only partially matches minivan. Similarity assessment: 2 (Low similarity).\\n- Label 3 (SUV): The SUV summary gives primary weight to a long, high-amplitude mid-rise/shoulder (t\u2248110\u2013220) and rounded peak, with mixed attribution around deep troughs. Our sample contains a long, large mid-ascent and rounded peak, so there is some agreement. But the pickup summary's explicit emphasis on trough\u2192rapid rebound and large final recovery better matches the observed SHAP pattern. Similarity assessment: 2 (Low similarity / borderline moderate).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The two most visually similar reference samples (Sample 56 and Sample 2) are both labeled 1.0 and have almost identical waveform morphology and SHAP localization (strong low-frequency red at the mid rise and final recovery). Their STFT and SHAP patterns match our test sample closely (same timing of red at the low-frequency bin for the trough\u2192peak windows). This supports label 1 strongly.\\n- There are also two reference samples labeled 0.0 with close morphology, but their SHAP maps show somewhat different emphasis in some runs and the labeling in the training set appears to sometimes split similar-looking series between label 0 and 1. Nevertheless the authoritative evidence here is the SHAP localization: our sample\u2019s strongest positive SHAP aligns with the trough\u2192rebound and final recovery pattern that the label-1 examples also emphasize.\\n- Potential confounders: deep trough near t\u2248400\u2013420 is present (which can be a strong cue for minivan in some samples), but in this sample SHAP does not put the strongest positive weight there \u2014 the model actually prioritizes the earlier trough\u2192rise and the final rebound. That attribution pattern is the decisive factor when choosing between the otherwise-similar sedan/minivan/SUV templates.\\n\\nFinal conclusion and justification: The test sample best matches label 1 (pickup). Rationale: the classifier\u2019s SHAP map highlights the same low-frequency trough\u2192sharp low-frequency ascent to a high plateau (mid-sequence) and the long final recovery that are repeatedly described as the primary pickup cues in the reference summaries and visible in the nearest training neighbors. Given the close match in timing, amplitude, slope behavior and SHAP localization to training samples labeled 1, I assign label 1 with a high similarity score of 4.\\n\\n(Per-label numeric similarities used during decision: label 0: 3, label 1: 4, label 2: 2, label 3: 2.)\"\n    ]\n}",

There is little SHAP-red exactly on the deepest trough near ~400\u2013440; that trough area is neutral-to-weak in SHAP.\\n- Window (a) ~80\u2013140: In the raw trace the series falls from near +0.9\u2013+1.5 (start) down to a smooth negative trough around -1.0 to -1.25 (minimum ~110\u2013120). The descent is gradual across many tens of steps (low instantaneous volatility), with small, low-amplitude micro\u2011ripples at the trough bottom. STFT: energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin (very-low-frequency content). Interpretation: a broad, smooth concave trough (low-frequency, long-duration) with tiny high\u2011frequency jitter \u2014 this exact morphology matches a SHAP-positive region and is treated by the model as supportive evidence.\\n- Window (b) ~200\u2013320: The series rises from near-zero/negative values through a sustained ramp to a broad rounded positive peak/plateau around +1.3\u2013+1.6 (peak centered ~270\u2013300). The rise is steeper than earlier descent (clear positive slope), shows a short plateau at the crest and small superposed micro\u2011bumps on the top. Volatility is low during the plateau; STFT again shows dominant low-frequency energy. Interpretation: a large-amplitude, smooth low-frequency convex lobe with a short plateau \u2014 heavily SHAP\u2011positive and a primary discriminative structure in the sample.\\n- Window (c) ~520\u2013576 (end): The trace climbs from negative/near-zero earlier to a final sustained plateau near +1.45\u2013+1.6 at the end. The slope here is moderate and steady with low volatility; SHAP shows modest positive support in the lowest frequency band. STFT confirms low-frequency dominance. Interpretation: a terminal positive lobe that reinforces the long-timescale envelope.\\n- Other notable local structure: a deep trough centered roughly ~400\u2013440 reaching ~ -1.6 to -1.7 (the global minimum). In this area SHAP is weak/neutral to slightly negative \u2014 the trough is present but the model attributes less direct positive evidence to it for the predicted label. The trough is smooth and low\u2011volatility (dominant low-frequency energy). There are small micro\u2011ripples concentrated at extrema; STFT shows tiny higher frequency power only at those points.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal dependence:\\n- Global envelope: the series is dominated by very-low-frequency (long-wavelength) oscillatory structure with roughly two main long cycles across the 577 points: (1) initial high \u2192 broad descent to trough (~80\u2013140) \u2192 rise to broad mid positive plateau (~200\u2013300) and (2) subsequent descent to the deepest trough (~380\u2013440) followed by a recovery to a final high plateau at the end (~520\u2013576). STFT shows almost all energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin throughout.\\n- Trends & slopes: descents are generally smooth; some descents (e.g., into the deepest trough) are steeper than rises but all changes happen over dozens to hundreds of steps (low short-term volatility). The mid-sequence rise (~200\u2013300) is relatively steep and produces the clearest SHAP-positive mass.\\n- Volatility & substructure: low micro\u2011volatility overall; small, low\u2011amplitude wiggles appear at trough/peak flanks and plateau tops. These micro features are minor and only modestly represented in STFT or SHAP.\\n- Temporal combination: the classifier appears to reward the ordered pattern trough (early) \u2192 steady rise \u2192 sustained positive plateau (mid) \u2192 later trough \u2192 final recovery. The SHAP map shows the classifier relies primarily on the presence, timing and duration of the low-frequency positive lobes and the early trough\u2192rise sequence rather than on the deepest trough itself.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and candidate selection:\\nI compared the observed local and global features to the four label summaries:\\n- Label 0 (sedan): Describes dominant very-low-frequency oscillation with early trough ~80\u2013140, broad mid positive lobe ~200\u2013300 with plateau, another deep trough near ~340\u2013440 and final positive plateau near the end. SHAP emphasis in the sedan summary is on low-frequency upward transitions and sustained positive plateaus (exactly the windows we observe). The sample\u2019s SHAP-red concentration aligns closely with the sedan pattern (early trough, mid rise/plateau and terminal plateau). High match.\\n- Label 1 (pickup): Also emphasizes low-frequency trough\u2192sharp rebound features and strong attribution to the recovery from a deep trough (particularly the rebound near ~418\u2013475). For our sample the deep trough exists, but SHAP does not place its strongest positive mass on the post-trough rebound region \u2014 instead the mid-plateau (~200\u2013300) and early trough are more strongly red. Pickup expects the rebound from the global trough to be the dominant positive cue; that is less true here. Moderate match.\\n- Label 2 (minivan): Emphasizes a dominant deep trough late in the series as the primary positive cue (with very strong SHAP red at that trough). In our sample the deep trough is present but SHAP does not assign the strongest positive weight there (it was neutral/weak). Also minivan summaries mention mid protrusions and certain local humps that are not especially dominant here.

Our sample has a mid rise but the combination of early trough + mid plateau + terminal plateau exactly matches label 0\u2019s described sequence more closely than the SUV summary emphasizes. Moderate-to-low match.\\nQuantified (preliminary) similarity ranking based on these observations: label 0: 4 (high); label 1: 3 (moderate); label 2: 1\u20132 (low); label 3: 2\u20133 (low\u2013moderate). The single highest match is label 0 (sedan).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check using reference samples and final verification:\\n- Similar reference samples: among the provided similar examples many (samples 36 and 50) are labeled 0 and show nearly identical structure (early trough ~100, mid plateau ~260\u2013300, deep trough near ~420, final rise). Their SHAP heatmaps emphasize the same low-frequency bands with red in the early-to-mid windows and modest support at the end \u2014 matching our sample closely.\\n- There are also similar examples labeled 1 (samples 56 and 2) that visually resemble the series. The difference between those pickup samples and the sedan ones in the reference set is subtle and largely comes down to where the SHAP mass is concentrated: pickups place the strongest positive SHAP mass on the rebound from the deepest trough, whereas sedans place more on the mid positive plateau and early trough\u2192rise sequence. For sample 48 the mid-plateau and early trough are the dominant SHAP-red areas, not the post-deep-trough rebound. That supports label 0 over label 1.\\n- Dissimilar references (label 2) show additional protrusions or different timing of the red SHAP mass; our sample lacks those minivan-specific signatures and their SHAP focus pattern.\\n- Fairness & scoring logic: I scored the final label (label 0) as 4 because (a) the exact temporal locations of the main red SHAP masses align with the sedan summary\u2019s characteristic windows (~80\u2013140 and ~200\u2013300 and terminal plateau), (b) the time-frequency content (dominant energy at the lowest frequency) and low volatility microstructure match the sedan description, and (c) multiple reference sedan examples show highly similar traces and SHAP patterns. Although pickups can look very similar in this dataset, the SHAP emphasis here is the deciding factor and matches the sedan pattern more closely.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 (sedan) with high similarity score 4.\\n\\nPer-label similarity justification (concise):\\n- label 0 (sedan) = 4 (high) \u2014 early trough (~80\u2013140), mid sustained positive plateau (~200\u2013300), dominant low-frequency energy, final plateau: all match strongly.\\n- label 1 (pickup) = 3 (moderate) \u2014 shares trough\u2192rise morphology but pickup expects strongest SHAP on post-deep-trough rebound which is not the main red area here.\\n- label 2 (minivan) = 1 (no/very low) \u2014 minivan descriptions emphasize a different late deep-trough SHAP signature and other mid-substructures not strongly present in this sample.\\n- label 3 (SUV) = 2 (low) \u2014 SUV emphasizes a single long mid ramp/shoulder as main cue; our sample\u2019s mid ramp exists but combined early trough + mid plateau + terminal plateau pattern fits sedan better.\\n\\nConfidence note: classification is driven both by the raw waveform morphology and by the SHAP heatmap that highlights which low-frequency windows the model considers evidence. Those SHAP windows map best to the sedan descriptor, so the final call is label 0.\"\n  ]\n}",

Change rate: this is the steepest fall in the record (larger negative slope than earlier descent). Shape: narrower and deeper trough than the first trough but still smooth, with minor micro-ripples along the flank.\\n  - t = 420\u2013576 (end): Long smooth recovery from the global trough up to a final positive plateau near +1.6\u2013+1.7 at the end. Trend: sustained low-frequency upward ramp; change rate moderate and fairly steady. Volatility: low, with small bumps on the rising flank and near the terminal plateau.\\n  - Frequency content (STFT): Almost all energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin across time. Occasional small increases in low-frequency power align with the major rises/falls. Minimal energy at mid/high frequencies \u2014 the small ripples at extrema appear only as faint higher-frequency content. This confirms the features are long-timescale (low-frequency) envelope events, not high-frequency transients.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal dependency:\\n  - Global morphology: Two principal low-frequency oscillatory cycles across the 577 steps: (1) initial high \u2192 broad trough (~t=100\u2013120) \u2192 broad mid positive peak (~t=260\u2013300), (2) mid-peak \u2192 deep global trough (~t=410\u2013425) \u2192 final sustained positive plateau (~t=520\u2013576). The envelope is dominated by large, slow lobes (low-frequency) with small localized high-frequency ripples at extrema.\\n  - Amplitude structure: Max around +1.6\u2013+1.7, min around -1.6 to -1.75; the second trough is deeper than the first. Slopes are asymmetric: the ascent into the mid-peak is reasonably steep, and the descent into the second trough is the steepest downward change.\\n  - Volatility & substructure: Low volatility overall; micro-fluctuations are concentrated at peaks and troughs and are small compared to the envelope.\\n  - Temporal dependence: The classifier would use the ordered sequence trough \u2192 steady rise \u2192 sustained positive plateau and the timing/duration of these low-frequency lobes. The long duration of each lobe and their relative amplitudes (particularly the rounded mid-peak and final positive plateau following a deep trough) are salient.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries (which label best fits?):\\n  - Comparison to label 0 (sedan) summary: Strong match. Label 0 descriptions emphasize dominant very-low-frequency lobes, an early moderate trough (~t\u224880\u2013140), a broad mid positive plateau/peak (~200\u2013300), a deeper central/trailing trough (~340\u2013440) and a final positive plateau (~500\u2013576). Our sample exhibits each of these elements (timing, amplitude, low volatility, micro-ripples at extrema) closely. Key matching attributes: envelope dominated by bottom-frequency band, rounded mid-peak with short plateau, deep second trough narrower and deeper than the first, final sustained rise \u2014 all signature sedan features in the provided summary.\\n  - Comparison to label 1 (pickup): Some high-level similarity exists (low-frequency trough-to-rise events), but pickups in the summary emphasize a particularly strong trough-to-high rebound often centered earlier (and the model gives particular weight to timing of the mid trough/rebound). Our sample\u2019s strongest evidence is the mid-shoulder/plateau and the specific ordering of two long cycles, which aligns better with label 0.\\n  - Comparison to label 2 (minivan): Label 2 often highlights a distinct early front bulge, a mid hump and a dominant very deep rear trough with slightly different timing/relative crest/trough shapes. While our sample has a deep trough, its mid-peak shoulder and the two-cycle symmetry are more typical of label 0 than the minivan patterns described (label 2 references more isolated mid-protrusions and slightly different attribution patterns).\\n  - Comparison to label 3 (SUV): Label 3 emphasizes a long, high-amplitude smooth upward ramp / shoulder in the mid-section (t\u2248110\u2013220) and rounded peak; this is similar in places, but label 3 examples also often have different balance (the mid-rise is the strongest unique cue). Our series contains a mid-rise, but the specific sequence of two cycles with the final large recovery + the earlier smaller trough/peak pattern matches label 0 examples more closely.\\n  - Quantitative judgment: Highest match is label 0. I assign label 0 a similarity score of 4 (high similarity) because the sample\u2019s waveform, timing of lobes, amplitude levels, and low-frequency dominance closely replicate the provided sedan examples. Scores to other labels are lower (label 3 moderate overlap but weaker than label 0; label 1 and label 2 lower similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples and final verification:\\n  - The provided \u201csimilar\u201d training examples for label 0 (samples 20, 16, 26) are visually and structurally almost identical to the test sample: same early descent to -1.1 to -1.2, mid rise/rounded plateau near +1.3\u20131.6 around 260\u2013300, deeper global trough \u2248 -1.6 to -1.8 around ~410\u2013430, and final rise to +1.5\u20131.7. STFTs for those refs also show dominant bottom-frequency energy. The match is near one-to-one for timing, amplitude and low-frequency signature. This confirms the high-confidence mapping to label 0.\\n  - The one provided sample labeled 3 (sample 7) shares the mid-rise shoulder motif but differs subtly in timing and relative prominence of the mid-rise as THE dominant diagnostic event. Our sample\u2019s balanced two-cycle envelope and final plateau are more characteristic of label 0 references than of typical label 3 references in the set.\\n  - The dissimilar examples (labels 2) show extra mid-segment irregularities and different crest/trough arrangements; their shapes and timing differ from the test sample\u2019s clean two-cycle low-frequency envelope, supporting the decision to reject label 2.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 (sedan) with high similarity score = 4. Rationale summary: the test sample displays the same ordered low-frequency lobes, timing, amplitude distribution, rounded mid-peak with short plateau, deeper second trough and final recovery described for label 0; STFT confirms dominant very-low-frequency energy as in the sedan pattern, and training reference samples for label 0 are near-identical in morphology, so label 0 is the best match.\"\n    ]\n}",

The descent is gradual (moderate negative slope) and the trough is broad (long duration ~30\u201350 steps).\\n  - t = 110\u2013220: slow to moderate rise from the trough through zero. The rise is fairly steady; small local micro-bumps appear on the rising flank (low-amplitude jitter). By ~t=200\u2013260 the signal is firmly positive.\\n  - t = 220\u2013300: reaches a broad positive peak/plateau around +1.3\u2013+1.6 (centered roughly 260\u2013280). The peak is rounded with a short plateau and tiny rapid fluctuations on top (micro-structure). The rise into this peak is somewhat steeper than the initial fall, then levels into the plateau.\\n  - t = 300\u2013360: gentle downward turning from the plateau toward zero (small-to-moderate negative slope), low volatility.\\n  - t = 360\u2013440: pronounced, relatively steep descent from near-zero/positive down to the global trough centered around t\u2248410\u2013425 at about -1.6 to -1.8. This trough is deep and somewhat narrower than the first trough but still smooth with small superposed ripples.\\n  - t = 440\u2013576: sustained, smooth recovery from the deep trough back to a high positive plateau by the end (~+1.5 to +1.6). The final rise is steady and low-volatility, with a small short-lived kink/dip around ~520 but mainly a smooth upward trend to the terminal plateau.\\n  - Frequency content (STFT): energy concentrated in the lowest frequency band across nearly the entire sequence; only very weak energy in higher bins coinciding with micro-bumps at extrema. This confirms the dominant long-timescale (very-low-frequency) envelope and that small fluctuations are secondary.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features and temporal relationships:\\n  - Dominant characteristics: very-low-frequency oscillatory envelope with roughly two long half-cycles across the 577 steps: negative lobe early (t\u224880\u2013120), large positive lobe mid (t\u2248220\u2013300), deep negative lobe late (t\u2248400\u2013430), and final positive recovery/plateau (t\u2248440\u2013576).\\n  - Amplitude and extremes: maxima around +1.5\u2013+1.6, minima around -1.6 to -1.8. The late trough is the deepest extreme.\\n  - Volatility: low overall; small high-frequency ripples are localized at peaks/troughs and do not dominate.

Asymmetry in slopes (certain rises steeper than some descents and vice versa) and the timing/duration of plateaus are important distinguishing elements.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match against label feature summaries and selection:\\n  - Label 0 (sedan) features: emphasized in the summary are (a) dominant very-low-frequency envelope with successive broad lobes, (b) early broad trough around t\u224880\u2013140, (c) broad positive peak around t\u2248200\u2013300 with a short plateau and micro-ripples, (d) a deep central/trailing trough near t\u2248340\u2013440 (the summaries explicitly mention troughs at ~120 and ~420 and a final plateau near end). The test sample matches these items closely in timing, shape, amplitude and low-frequency energy. => High similarity (score 4).\\n  - Label 1 (pickup) features: also low-frequency dominated, with emphasis on a pronounced trough\u2192rapid rebound and a particularly discriminative long recovery around the end; pickup summaries highlight a steep mid rise (~200\u2013280) and the recovery from the global trough as key cues. Our sample has a mid rise and final recovery, but the overall pattern shows two clear broad cycles and a mid plateau that more closely matches the sedan description; the pickup pattern tends to emphasize one dominant trough\u2192rebound pairing as the strongest cue. The sample shares some elements but not the same emphasis/timing. => Low\u2013moderate similarity (score 2).\\n  - Label 2 (minivan) features: also dominated by low-frequency troughs/crests but the minivan description stresses a pronounced deep trough in the mid-late window that is the primary discriminative element and several distinct small protrusions / mid crests. Although our sample has a deep late trough, the overall ordered pattern (early trough, mid plateau, deep trough, final rise) and the micro-structure align better with label 0; also the minivan summaries indicate different relative weighting of mid peaks (some negative SHAP there), which doesn't match as well. => Low similarity (score 1).\\n  - Label 3 (SUV) features: description emphasizes a strong long, high-amplitude rise in the mid-section (t\u2248110\u2013220) with a rounded shoulder/plateau, followed by a deep trough later. Our sample contains a long rise and a rounded mid peak and later deep trough as well, so there is a notable overlap with the SUV pattern, but the sedan summaries and reference examples explicitly describe the same sequence of alternating broad lobes with similar timing as our sample. The SUV match is therefore moderate but not better than the sedan match. => Moderate similarity (score 3).\\n\\n  - Based on this comparison, label 0 (sedan) is the best match: timing of early trough (~80\u2013120), mid positive plateau (~200\u2013300), deep late trough (~400\u2013430) and final rise/plateau (~500\u2013576) together with concentrated low-frequency energy match label 0 almost exactly.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n  - Reference samples labeled 0 (samples 16, 20, 50) are visually and structurally very similar: each shows an early broad trough near ~100, a rounded mid positive peak around ~260\u2013280, a deep late trough near ~410\u2013430, and a final recovery to a positive plateau. Their STFTs likewise show bottom-frequency concentration. The test sample 53 aligns with these reference plots in nearly every major feature and timing. This supports a high-confidence assignment to label 0.\\n  - Reference sample labeled 3 (sample 7) is similar in parts (mid rise/shoulder) but the three provided label-0 examples collectively match the test sample more closely overall.\\n  - The two dissimilar examples (labels 2) show additional local structure and different emphasis that are not present in the test sample (their mid/early small peaks and extra kinks differ from the clean two-cycle envelope here), further reducing likelihood of label 2.\\n\\nFinal decision and scoring justification:\\n  - Chosen label: label 0 (sedan).\\n  - Confidence / similarity score for chosen label: 4 (high similarity). The sample matches the label-0 feature/pattern list very closely in timing, amplitude, shape (broad low-frequency lobes with micro-ripples at extrema), slope asymmetries, and STFT low-frequency dominance.\\n\\nPer-label similarity summary (used to reason the score):\\n  - label 0: 4 (high similarity)\\n  - label 1: 2 (low\u2013moderate similarity; shares trough/recovery elements but different emphasis/timing)\\n  - label 2: 1 (low similarity)\\n  - label 3: 3 (moderate similarity; shares mid-rise/shoulder but overall envelope matches label 0 better)\\n\\nConclusion: assign label 0 (sedan) with high similarity (score 4).\"\n  ]\n}",

There are also positive low-frequency patches near the later trough-to-rise region (t\u2248340\u2013420). The SHAP energy is almost entirely in the bottom frequency band (very low frequency).\\n- Map to the time series (exact local descriptions):\\n  1) Early trough (t\u224880\u2013120): the series falls from an initial high (~+1.45 at t\u22480) to a smooth local trough near -1.15 to -1.25 around t\u2248100. This descent is broad and smooth (low volatility), the trough bottom shows tiny superposed wiggles (micro-ripples amplitude <<0.1). STFT: small low-frequency energy. SHAP: small-to-moderate positive mass in adjacent low-frequency cells (supporting evidence but not the strongest).\\n  2) Strong mid rise and rounded peak (t\u2248200\u2013280, peak near t\u2248260): the signal climbs steadily from slightly negative through zero to a broad rounded peak of about +1.4\u2013+1.6 centered ~t=260\u2013270. The rise is relatively steep compared with the earlier descent (sustained positive slope over ~70\u201390 steps) and the plateau at the crest shows small, fast micro-bumps. STFT: marked increase in the lowest-frequency bin during this window. SHAP: strongest positive contributions are concentrated here at the bottom frequency \u2014 this window is the single most positively attributed region.\\n  3) Large later trough (t\u2248340\u2013440, global minimum near t\u2248420): the series falls from the mid-peak down to the global trough around -1.7 to -1.85 at ~t=420. The descent is steep and the trough is relatively narrow compared to the mid-peak trough but still smooth, with minimal high-frequency jitter. STFT: dominant low-frequency energy. SHAP: low-frequency cells around this window show positive to neutral attribution (some red present at lowest row), indicating the trough contributes to the decision but less strongly than the mid-rise/peak.\\n  4) Final recovery and plateau (t\u2248470\u2013576): after the global trough the signal steadily climbs back into positive range, reaching ~+1.4 to +1.6 at the end. The final rise is smooth and the end is a sustained positive plateau with only small local bumps. STFT: persistent low-frequency energy at the end. SHAP: low-frequency row near the end shows modest positive attribution, reinforcing the earlier positive evidence.\\n- Change rates and volatility: across the red windows volatility is low (smooth, low-frequency envelope). The steepest local slopes occur on the mid-rise (\u2248t=200\u2013280) and the descent into the global trough (\u2248t=280\u2013420). Micro-structure (small high-frequency ripples) is limited to extrema and appears as faint higher-frequency energy on STFT; SHAP assigns these micro-ripples little direct weight compared with the low-frequency envelope.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and dependencies:\\n- Global shape and periodicity: the sample shows a dominant, very-low-frequency oscillatory envelope with roughly two long half-cycles across the 577 steps: an initial fall to an early trough, a large mid rise/plateau, then a deep later trough and a final recovery to a sustained positive plateau. This matches a long-period (~250\u2013300 step) oscillation rather than any short-lived event.\\n- Amplitude structure: extrema are large: start near +1.4\u20131.6, minima down to roughly -1.7 to -1.85, and maxima up to +1.5\u2013+1.6. The mid-peak is one of the highest sustained positive lobes and the late trough is the deepest negative lobe.\\n- Volatility: low overall, smooth curves; micro-ripples at peaks/trough bottoms but they are small amplitude and sparse.\\n- Time dependence and combination: the classifier appears to rely on the ordered sequence trough\u2192strong, sustained rise\u2192rounded positive plateau\u2192deep trough\u2192final recovery. The strongest discriminative evidence (per SHAP) is the mid-rise/plateau low-frequency structure and the final recovery that consolidates the positive evidence\u2014these events occur in a time-extended, coherent manner rather than as isolated spikes.\\n- Frequency corroboration: the STFT shows almost all energy concentrated at the very bottom frequency bins during the red windows, confirming the model is keyed to long-timescale shape rather than high-frequency texture.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and preliminary label choice (similarity scoring reasoning):\\n- Label 0 (sedan): The label_0 summary emphasizes: dominant very-low-frequency envelope with two long cycles, an early trough (~t\u224880\u2013140), a broad positive lobe/plateau around t\u2248200\u2013300, a deep central/trailing trough near t\u2248340\u2013440, and a final positive plateau near the end. SHAP for label_0 is concentrated in the lowest frequency around the mid-rise and end. The sample matches these items closely (timing, amplitude, low volatility, SHAP localization). => High similarity. Score for label 0 = 4.\\n- Label 1 (pickup): Also low-frequency dominated with a diagnostic deep trough followed by a strong rebound (particularly positive SHAP for the trough-to-recovery near t\u2248418\u2013475). Sample 55 does have a deep trough and a final recovery, and SHAP shows some positive mass around the recovery, but the defining emphasis for pickup is a particularly pronounced trough-to-rebound pairing centered earlier or with a different slope/asymmetry. The sample\u2019s strongest positive SHAP is the mid-rise/plateau instead of only the trough-to-recovery being the dominant cue. => Moderate similarity. Score for label 1 = 3.\\n- Label 2 (minivan): Summary emphasizes a very deep broad trough around t\u2248420\u2013480 that is the main positive cue, plus a characteristic front hump and a particular mid-sequence crest pattern. While sample 55 does present a deep trough near t\u2248420, in this sample the mid-rise/rounded peak and end plateau are stronger SHAP contributors; minivan descriptions place even stronger emphasis on that late trough being the primary driver. The match is weaker than for labels 0 and 1. => Low-to-moderate similarity. Score for label 2 = 2.\\n- Label 3 (SUV): Summary emphasizes a broad long low-frequency upward ramp/shoulder in the mid-section (t\u2248110\u2013220) with strong positive attribution there. Sample 55 does have a strong mid rise and rounded peak which superficially matches SUV mid-shoulder features; however SUV patterns in the summary often pair that mid-shoulder with different subsequent shape (e.g., particular spike + deep trough behavior and different SHAP weighting). Given the close resemblance to label_0 reference patterns and label_0\u2019s explicit listing of the same sequence, SUV is a weaker match than sedan. => Low-to-moderate similarity. Score for label 3 = 2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- Visual comparison with the four similar reference examples (samples 41, 50, 42, 13 labeled 0.0): those four references show essentially the same waveform: early descent to ~-1.1, strong mid-rise to ~+1.4\u20131.6 around t\u2248260, deep trough near t\u2248420, and final recovery to a positive plateau. Their STFT and SHAP heatmaps also concentrate positive attribution in the lowest-frequency bin at the mid-rise and end\u2014this is a near one-to-one match with the test sample 55.\\n- Dissimilar references (samples labeled 2.0) indeed emphasize different local patterns: either multiple intermediate bumps, or the classifier\u2019s SHAP mass focused differently (e.g., trough is the dominant indicator). While test sample 55 shares the deep trough with those label-2 examples, the overall envelope and SHAP weighting align much better with the label-0 references.\\n- Fairness and scoring logic: the scoring used above rates how many of the distinctive, positively attributed features from each label summary match the test case. Label 0 receives the highest score because multiple hallmark features (timing, amplitude, low-frequency concentration, SHAP localization at mid-rise & end) are present and align strongly with label_0's description and with multiple labeled-0 reference examples.\\n\\nFinal determination: label 0 (sedan). Rationale summary: sample 55 exhibits the canonical low-frequency oscillatory envelope strongly described for label 0: early broad trough (~t\u224880\u2013120), a pronounced mid low-frequency rise and rounded plateau (~t\u2248200\u2013280) with highest positive SHAP attribution there, a subsequent deep trough (~t\u2248340\u2013440), and a final sustained positive recovery/plateau (~t\u2248500\u2013576).

The visually prominent red patches occur roughly around: (A) ~150\u2013220, (B) ~240\u2013300, (C) ~340\u2013430 (centered near ~410\u2013420), and (D) a positive streak toward the series end (~500\u2013576). These are all in the very-low-frequency band.\\n\\n- Map these to the time series and describe each precisely:\\n  A) Early-to-mid recovery (approx. t \u2248 150\u2013220): amplitude and shape \u2014 the trace moves upward from a prior negative trough (~-1.15 at ~100\u2013120) into a steadily rising ramp. Amplitude change: about +1.0 to +1.6 units over ~80 time steps (average slope on the order of +0.012 to +0.02 units/step). Volatility: low (smooth curvature) with only tiny high-frequency ripples (~\u00b10.02\u20130.05) visible near the rising flank. Substructure: smoothly convex rising limb, no sharp spikes; STFT shows increased energy at the lowest frequency bins here.\\n  B) Mid positive plateau/peak (approx. t \u2248 240\u2013300): amplitude and shape \u2014 the ramp reaches a broad rounded peak around +1.4 to +1.6 centered near ~260\u2013280. This plateau is short but sustained (tens of steps). Volatility: low on the plateau, with small top-of-crest micro-bumps (amplitude \u2248 0.02\u20130.1). The SHAP red in the bottom frequency row matches this broad, high-amplitude positive lobe.\\n  C) Deep central/trailing trough (approx. t \u2248 340\u2013430): amplitude and shape \u2014 after the mid-peak the signal falls steeply through zero into the global minimum near ~-1.6 to -1.8 (deepest ~-1.7 around ~410\u2013420). The descent is relatively steep (slope magnitude larger than many prior slopes; rough average descent \u2248 -0.02 to -0.03 units/step). The trough is fairly broad (spans multiple tens of steps) and smooth, with only minor jitter at the bottom. The SHAP red around the low-frequency row here indicates the model treats this large slow negative excursion (and the succeeding recovery) as important evidence.\\n  D) Final recovery and end plateau (approx. t \u2248 470\u2013576): amplitude and shape \u2014 after the deep trough the series climbs smoothly back into positive territory, ending around +1.4 to +1.6. The final rise is steady (average slope \u2248 +0.02 units/step), producing a positive plateau at the right edge. Volatility: low during the rise and plateau, with small localized bumps (e.g., a short dip/flattening near ~500\u2013525). STFT confirms energy concentrated near the lowest frequency band during this whole recovery.\\n\\n- Frequency-domain/volatility confirmation: The STFT image shows the vast majority of signal energy at the lowest frequency bins throughout the timeline and small, localized increases in the same low bins at the times above. High-frequency energy is negligible except for faint traces at extrema. This corroborates the SHAP localisation (red at bottom-frequency band) and supports that the discriminative features are long-timescale envelope shapes with small micro-ripples only at peaks/troughs.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series structure and temporal dependence:\\n\\n- Global waveform: The series is dominated by long, low-frequency oscillatory structure (roughly two long half-cycles / two main lobes across 577 steps). The ordered sequence is: (1) start high (~+1.5) -> (2) broad descent to a first trough around ~100\u2013130 (~-1.1 to -1.2) -> (3) sustained rise and rounded positive peak around ~260\u2013280 (+1.4\u2013+1.6) -> (4) steep descent to the deepest trough near ~410\u2013420 (~-1.7) -> (5) steady final recovery to a right-edge plateau (~+1.4).\\n\\n- Trends and asymmetries: Rises and falls are asymmetric \u2014 the mid-rise up to the positive peak is somewhat steeper/shorter than the earlier descent into the first trough, while the fall into the deep trough is one of the steepest transitions in the record. The final recovery is long and steady. Overall volatility is low; the signal is smooth with small micro-oscillations concentrated at extrema.\\n\\n- Temporal dependence: The classifier (per SHAP) appears to exploit the ordered sequence of trough \u2192 steady rise \u2192 positive plateau \u2192 deep trough \u2192 final rise. The timing and relative amplitudes of these low-frequency lobes (their width, depth, and the slopes connecting them) form a coherent shape-based signature across the record rather than isolated instantaneous events.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare to label feature summaries and select matching label:\\n\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary: key characteristics are dominant very-low-frequency envelope with (i) an early broad trough near t\u224880\u2013140, (ii) a broad positive peak near t\u2248200\u2013300 with a short plateau, (iii) a deeper trough near t\u2248340\u2013440, and (iv) final positive rise/plateau near the end. SHAP emphasis is on low-frequency rows at roughly the same times.\\n\\n- Matching evaluation: Sample 55's observed events align closely with the label 0 description: early broad trough (~100\u2013130), positive rounded peak (~260\u2013280), deep trough (~410\u2013420), and final rise to end plateau (~500\u2013576). STFT and SHAP both concentrate energy/attribution in the lowest frequency band at those exact windows. This is a strong one-to-one match.\\n\\n- Other labels:\\n  * Label 1 (pickup) also emphasizes low-frequency trough\u2192sharp rise patterns (notably a discriminative mid-sequence trough and a strong recovery). Sample 55 does contain trough\u2192rise pairs, but the overall envelope shape (two low-frequency cycles with the described timings) matches label 0 more closely than label 1. There is partial overlap in features, but pickup's emphasis on the mid-sequence sharp rebound as the primary cue is less characteristically strong here compared with the sedan template.\\n  * Label 2 (minivan) shares some elements (deep rear trough near ~420 and strong recovery) but its summary also stresses a particular mid-section hump, front bulge, and the dominance of the late deep trough as the primary cue. Sample 55's entire sequence of alternating lobes better matches the sedan narrative than the minivan's distinctive mid-hump + extremely deep rear recess pattern.\\n  * Label 3 (SUV) emphasizes a strong long upward rise/shoulder in the midsection (t\u2248110\u2013220) as the main discriminative feature. Sample 55 does have a long rise and a rounded peak, but the full pattern of early trough + mid-peak + deep later trough + final plateau tracks the sedan description more precisely.\\n\\n- Label selection and similarity scoring (single-score corresponds to chosen label): Given the extremely close alignment with label 0's described lobes, timings and SHAP attribution, label 0 (sedan) is selected. I assign similarity scores (1\u20134) to how well sample 55 matches each label's feature set: label 0 = 4 (high similarity), label 1 = 3 (moderate similarity; shares trough\u2192rebound features but not the same emphasis), label 2 = 2 (low similarity; shares late trough/recovery but differs in mid-hump/front bulge emphasis), label 3 = 2 (low similarity; partial match to a mid-rise but overall envelope differs).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n\\n- Reference matching: The four 'similar' reference samples provided (samples 41, 50, 42, 13) are all labeled 0 and their time-series, STFT and SHAP maps are visually almost indistinguishable from sample 55: they show the same early trough ~100, broad mid positive peak ~260\u2013280, deep trough ~410\u2013430, and end rise, and their SHAP heatmaps place red mass in the same bottom-frequency time windows. This reinforces the conclusion that the classifier learned to associate this structured low-frequency envelope with label 0 and that sample 55 belongs to that pattern.\\n\\n- Dissimilar references (labels 2): the two dissimilar examples (label 2) show more prominent small-scale substructure, different hump locations, or a stronger emphasis of other low-frequency patterns; their SHAP patterns and curve morphologies are visibly different from sample 55. This further increases confidence that sample 55 is not best described by label 2.\\n\\n- Fairness/consistency check: The decision is consistent across the three evidence channels: (1) raw time series morphology, (2) STFT concentrated energy at lowest frequency band, and (3) SHAP attribution highlighting exactly the low-frequency lobes that define label 0 in the provided summaries. Reference examples labeled 0 confirm the match. The scoring also places label 1 as the second-most similar because pickups share trough\u2192rebound motif, but the precise timing and plateau structure are more sedan-typical.\\n\\nFinal output: Based on the detailed, cross-checked analysis above, the most accurate classification is label 0 (sedan) with high similarity score 4. The per-label similarity judgements used to arrive at and verify this decision are: label 0 = 4, label 1 = 3, label 2 = 2, label 3 = 2.\"\n    ]\n}"

There is a secondary, smaller red patch near the end-region (roughly t \u2248 500\u2013560) but the dominant attribution is the mid-sequence band. Using the time plot and STFT to interpret these windows:\\n  - Window A (t \u2248 150\u2013220): On the time trace this corresponds to the transition from the local negative minimum around t \u2248 150\u2013170 (value \u2248 -1.5 to -1.7) into a sustained, large low-frequency ascent that continues past t \u2248 220. Characteristics: amplitude change \u2248 +2.8 to +3.2 (from trough to later peak), the rise is predominantly low-frequency (STFT energy concentrated in the bottom bin), slope during the steepest portion (roughly 200\u2013280) is relatively high (~+0.03\u2013+0.04 units/step), volatility is low (smooth ramp) with only small superimposed micro-ripples visible as faint higher-frequency energy in the STFT. Shape: a clear trough \u2192 rapid sustained rise (asymmetric half-cycle). This region is the strongest positive evidence for classification (largest red mass).\\n  - Window B (t \u2248 500\u2013576, weaker red): corresponds to the final recovery/plateau where the series climbs from negative/near-zero up to a late positive plateau near +1.4\u2013+1.6. Characteristics: steady, low-volatility upward trend, low-frequency dominated (STFT bottom bin), acts as confirming evidence by consolidating the long recovery after the deep trough earlier.\\n- Other important timepoints (for context but with weaker SHAP): the global trough around t \u2248 410\u2013430 (value \u2248 -1.6 to -1.7) is visible in the time series. In this sample the SHAP heatmap places the strongest positive weight not on that late trough but rather on the trough\u2192rebound windows (especially the mid trough and the subsequent ascend). The STFT confirms almost all discriminative power lies at the very lowest frequencies; higher-frequency content is minimal and localized to small ripples at extrema.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / combined time-series characterization:\\n- Overall morphology: the sample is dominated by long-wavelength, low-frequency envelope oscillations (roughly two large half-cycles across 577 points): (1) initial high \u2192 broad descent to a deep trough near t \u2248 150\u2013170, (2) a strong, relatively steep low-frequency ascent to a mid-to-late positive peak near t \u2248 270\u2013310, (3) a long descent to the global trough at \u2248 410\u2013430, and (4) a final sustained recovery to a high positive plateau at the end (~t=576). The STFT shows concentrated energy in the lowest frequency bins throughout these intervals.\\n- Slopes & asymmetry: the ascent from the mid trough to the peak (\u2248200\u2013280) is steeper than some descents; the final recovery is long and steady. These asymmetric rise/ fall rates (sharp ascent after a trough, long recovery later) are important temporal cues for the classifier.\\n- Volatility and microstructure: low short-term volatility overall; micro-ripples (small amplitude, short duration) are present mainly near peaks/troughs but contain negligible power compared with the DC/very-low-frequency components.\\n- Temporal dependence / pattern combination: the classifier appears to use the ordered sequence trough \u2192 steep rebound \u2192 peak \u2192 descent \u2192 deep trough \u2192 long recovery. In this sample the mid-sequence trough-to-rebound (150\u2013220 region) is singled out by SHAP as the most diagnostic, with the late recovery strengthening the decision.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature summaries and choose label:\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary highlights: strong positive SHAP cluster around t\u2248150\u2013220 at low frequency corresponding to trough \u2192 sustained upward ramp, the presence of a steep ascent to a local maximum ~200\u2013280, and a later long recovery from the global trough into the final high plateau. The sample exactly contains these elements: a deep mid trough around 150\u2013170 followed by a steep low-frequency ascent to ~+1.4\u20131.6 in the 200\u2013300 window, and then a broad recovery from the global trough back to the end plateau. The SHAP-red localization for the test sample (strong bottom-frequency red at \u2248150\u2013220 and supportive positive near the final rise) directly matches the pickup description. Similar reference training samples (samples 49, 11, 4, 31 shown) are labelled 1 and display highly similar waveform envelopes and the same SHAP bottom-row red concentration in the 150\u2013220 band. Conclusion: very high match to label 1.\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary: also emphasizes low-frequency lobes, a positive plateau around 200\u2013300, and trough\u2192rise sequences. There is a resemblance: the mid positive plateau and the presence of troughs are present in our sample. However the pickup summary more specifically stresses the strong trough\u2192rebound at ~150\u2013220 and a later long recovery which is a closer, more explicit match than the sedan description (sedan attribution places more emphasis on the positive plateau as the primary evidence and sometimes down-weights very deep negative excursions). So label 0 is similar but slightly less precise than label 1 for the diagnostic windows here.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary: minivan emphasizes a very pronounced late deep trough near t\u2248420\u2013470 and large low-frequency trough contribution there; it also mentions front-bulge and mid-humps. Our sample does have a deep trough around 410\u2013430 and a final recovery, which aligns with minivan features, but the SHAP for this sample is concentrated in the earlier trough\u2192rise window (150\u2013220) rather than placing the strongest weight mainly on the late trough as in the provided minivan examples. Thus there is moderate similarity but not the closest match.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary: highlights a long, smooth upward ramp (t\u2248110\u2013220) with a rounded shoulder and that ramp is often the strongest positive region. Our sample does show an important upward ramp, but the label-3 description often pairs that ramp with other characteristic differences (specific shoulder shape, relative weighting against later deep troughs). The pickup summary (label 1) captures both the early trough\u2192ramp and the later recovery pattern seen here more completely than the SUV description does.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 quantitative similarity scores (per-label, using the rubric):\\n- label 0 (sedan): 3 (moderate similarity). Rationale: Shares the low-frequency lobed envelope and the mid positive plateau, but the SHAP emphasis and the asymmetric trough\u2192steep-rise timing match pickup more closely.\\n- label 1 (pickup): 4 (high similarity). Rationale: The test sample shows the exact diagnostic elements emphasized for pickups: mid trough at ~150\u2013220 with a strong low-frequency rebound \u2192 steep rise to a peak around ~200\u2013300, and a long recovery from the global trough to an end plateau. SHAP localization and STFT energy both align with the pickup pattern; reference training samples labelled 1 visually and attribution-wise match closely.\\n- label 2 (minivan): 3 (moderate similarity). Rationale: Test sample contains a deep late trough and a strong final recovery which are key minivan cues, but the strongest positive SHAP is earlier (150\u2013220) unlike the canonical minivan examples where the late trough is the dominant SHAP region.\\n- label 3 (SUV): 2 (low similarity). Rationale: While there is an upward ramp that could be interpreted as the SUV shoulder, the overall envelope (paired troughs and the particular timing/strength of rebound and late recovery) better matches pickup/minivan patterns; the SUV-specific shoulder/peak + later behavior described in label 3 is less of a direct match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four reference 'similar' training samples included in the prompt (samples labelled 1.0) show nearly identical long-wavelength trough \u2192 steep rise \u2192 peak \u2192 deep trough \u2192 final recovery sequences and SHAP red concentrated in the same low-frequency mid window (\u2248150\u2013220). Visual and STFT/SHAP patterns are consistent across those references and the test sample. The two dissimilar references (one labelled 3 and one labelled 1 but noted as 'dissimilar' in the prompt) either emphasize different timing or show different SHAP distributions; they do not contradict the pickup match for this test sample.\\n- Given the exact match of the strongest SHAP region (lowest-frequency band around \u2248150\u2013220) to the pickup summary, the matching waveform shape (deep trough followed by a steep, sustained low-frequency ascent to a high plateau, and then a later deep trough with long recovery), and the agreement with multiple labeled-1 reference examples, the most accurate classification is label 1 (pickup). The similarity scoring is fair and consistent with the rubric: label 1 receives the highest possible score (4) and the other labels receive lower scores corresponding to how many key elements they share with the test sample.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1 (pickup) with high confidence (score = 4).\"\n    ]\n}",

On the time trace that window covers the trough-to-peak transition: the signal climbs from a local minimum near -1.5\u2026-1.7 (centered ~160\u2013180) up to a pronounced positive plateau/peak near +1.4\u2026+1.6 (peak around t \u2248 260\u2013300). This is a large low-frequency recovery: amplitude change \u2248 3.0 units overall (trough to peak), smooth shape, low short-term volatility (only small micro-ripples on the rising flank). The rise occurs over ~100 steps (avg slope order +0.03 units/step), i.e. a relatively steep low-frequency ascent rather than a sharp spike. The STFT shows increased energy at the lowest frequency bin in this same interval, confirming the event is dominated by long-timescale components rather than high-frequency noise. SHAP there is strongly positive (red), so the model treats this trough\u2192rise\u2192plateau event as positive evidence.\\n- A secondary red patch in the SHAP map appears at low frequency in the late portion of the series (roughly t \u2248 420\u2013520). In the time series this corresponds to the global trough near t \u2248 410\u2013420 (value \u2248 -1.6 to -1.7) followed by a long, smooth recovery to the final positive plateau around +1.4\u2026+1.6 at the end (t \u2248 523\u2013576). This recovery spans ~150 steps (avg slope \u2248 +0.02 units/step), is low-volatility and concentrates STFT energy again at the bottom frequency bins. SHAP red here indicates the model attributes positive evidence to the long late rebound as well.\\n- There are small short-duration dips and micro-bumps (e.g., brief dip ~500\u2013523) visible in the trace, but they show weak or mixed SHAP and appear as faint, slightly higher-frequency energy in STFT; they are secondary cues only.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal dependence:\\n- Global structure: a low-frequency, large-amplitude oscillatory envelope with roughly two main cycles across 577 points: (1) start high \u2192 fall to first trough (~t 150\u2013180), (2) strong ascent to mid positive plateau (~t 260\u2013300), (3) descent to global late trough (~t 400\u2013420), (4) long recovery to end plateau (~t 520\u2013576). Amplitudes: maxima around +1.4\u2026+1.6, minima around -1.6\u2026-1.7. Volatility is low overall, with localized micro-ripples at extrema.\\n- Frequency content: STFT and the SHAP low-frequency row both show that nearly all discriminative energy lies in the lowest frequency bins (near-DC / long-timescale). There is little persistent mid/high-frequency energy. That confirms the classifier is relying on large-scale silhouette envelope timing, amplitude and slope rather than short spikes.\\n- Temporal dependence and combination: the classifier appears to require the specific ordering: an early trough followed by a steep low-frequency ascent to a mid positive plateau and, importantly, a later deep trough followed by a long recovery into a final positive plateau. Both low-frequency upward recoveries (mid and late) are positively attributed by SHAP and together provide coherent evidence in time for the chosen label.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature lists and initial label selection (quantified similarity):\\n- Compare to label_1 (pickup): The label_1 description emphasizes a trough in the ~150\u2013220 window followed by a steep ascent to a +1.4\u2013+1.6 peak, and a later deep trough near ~420 followed by a sustained recovery to the end. It notes strong SHAP red at the midrise (~150\u2013220) and again on the long late recovery (~418\u2013475). This matches the test sample very closely in timing, amplitude, slope and SHAP localization. I therefore select label_1 as the best match.\\n- Quick contrasts: label_2 (minivan) also highlights a deep trough near t\u2248420\u2013480 and low-frequency dominance, but its emphasis is that the deep late trough is the principal positive cue (and moderate/negative weight on some mid peaks). The test sample places very strong SHAP weight on the mid trough\u2192rise (~150\u2013220) as well as on the late rebound \u2014 the paired mid-rise + late rebound is exactly the pickup signature in label_1. label_0 (sedan) and label_3 (SUV) focus more on symmetric slow oscillatory plateaus or a dominant mid shoulder respectively; their described discriminative windows and SHAP emphasis do not align as well with the two positively-weighted regions here. Based on these comparisons, label_1 is highest matching.\\n- Assigned similarity score for chosen label (label_1): 4 (high similarity). Rationale: multiple distinctive elements described for pickup (early deep trough then sharp low-frequency ascent to +1.4\u20131.6; later deep trough then long recovery to final plateau; SHAP red concentrated at low-frequency rows in the same windows) are all present and closely aligned temporally and morphologically in the test sample.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four provided \u201csimilar\u201d reference plots (Samples 49, 11, 4, 31) are all label 1 and show near-identical envelope shapes: early trough ~150\u2013200, strong rise to mid positive plateau, large descent to a late trough ~400\u2013430 and a long recovery to a positive end. Their STFTs and SHAP maps show the same low-frequency red band around the midrise (~157\u2013209) and weaker activity elsewhere \u2014 this mirrors the test sample\u2019s STFT and SHAP exactly. Dissimilar references (the provided label 3 example and other dissimilar examples) show different mid-section emphasis or different timing of strongest positive attribution and therefore do not match the test sample as well.\\n- Fairness and scoring: the score of 4 reflects an almost complete overlap between the test sample\u2019s discriminative windows (timing, amplitude, slope, low-frequency character) and the label_1 pattern and the label_1 reference samples. There is no substantial contradictory evidence (e.g., SHAP heavy negative attribution in those windows) that would reduce confidence.\\n\\nConclusion: The test sample is classified as label 1 (pickup) with high confidence. Score 4 indicates a high degree of feature similarity between this sample and the pickup class patterns described and shown in the references.\"\n    ]\n}",

On the trace this corresponds to the upward inflection from a local negative trough into a sustained positive ramp. Quantitative description: the signal climbs from about -1.3\u2026-1.4 (trough near t\u2248170\u2013190) up to roughly +0.8\u2026+1.2 across \u224860\u2013120 time steps. The rise is smooth, dominated by a low-frequency trend with small high-frequency ripples at the flank; average instantaneous slope over the steepest part is on the order of +0.02\u2013+0.04 units/step. Volatility in this window is low (small micro-oscillations of a few hundredths to a few tenths superposed on the main ramp). The STFT shows increased energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin for this window, confirming the rise is a slow, large-scale envelope change rather than a short transient.\\n  - Secondary positively attributed areas (weaker red at bottom-frequency row) align with the mid/late positive plateau around t \u2248 250\u2013320 (peak \u2248 +1.2\u2026+1.45) and also with the terminal recovery (t \u2248 500\u2013576) where the trace returns to \u2248 +1.6\u2026+1.75. The plateau around 250\u2013320 is broad and rounded with low volatility and minor top-side micro-bumps; STFT again concentrates energy in the lowest bin. The terminal rise is a smooth, sustained monotonic climb with low short-term volatility (slope roughly +0.02\u2013+0.03 per step near the end).\\n  - The large negative excursion centered near t \u2248 400\u2013440 (global trough \u2248 -1.6 to -1.75) appears in the time series but shows little strong positive SHAP attribution (the heatmap is not strongly red there) \u2014 the trough is wide, smooth and low-volatility (a low-frequency U-shaped valley). The STFT shows high magnitude at the very-low-frequency band during that trough, consistent with a long-timescale envelope event.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series structure and dependence:\\n  - Global description: the sample is dominated by very-low-frequency envelope structure (two long half-cycles across 577 steps): an initial high \u2192 slow fall to a moderate trough (~t\u2248170), a strong low-frequency rebound and mid positive plateau (~t\u2248250\u2013320), a descent into a deeper trough (~t\u2248400\u2013440), and a long recovery to a high positive level at the end (~t\u2248520\u2013576). The STFT confirms almost all measurable energy is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins \u2014 discriminative information is the coarse silhouette (long, smooth lobes) rather than high-frequency texture.\\n  - Volatility and substructure: volatility is generally low with small micro-ripples concentrated at peaks/trough flanks and a few short blips (higher-frequency content is weak). The series shows asymmetry in slopes: the mid-sequence rebound is relatively steep compared to some longer descents, and the final recovery is also a steady, moderately steep rise.\\n  - Temporal dependence: classification-relevant cues appear to be the ordered sequence trough \u2192 sustained rise \u2192 mid plateau \u2192 deep trough \u2192 final recovery. The model appears to reward the presence, timing and amplitude of the mid/late low-frequency lobes (especially the mid rise/plateau and final recovery) as a combined pattern.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries (which label best explains the sample?):\\n  - Label 2 (minivan) summary key items: slow, low-frequency silhouette with early front hump, a mid/cabin rise around ~200\u2013320, a dominant deep rear trough near ~380\u2013480 (the deepest negative), and a strong terminal recovery to positive at the end. SHAP in label-2 reference emphasises the large rear trough and the final recovery; energy concentrated at lowest frequency. The test sample shows the same ordered components (mid rise/plateau, deep trough ~420, final strong recovery) and STFT/SHAP align with low-frequency attribution. Similar training examples shown (e.g., Samples 58 and 25) are visually very close to this test sample. => High similarity.\\n  - Label 1 (pickup): also emphasizes trough\u2192rebound events and long recovery windows (especially a mid trough followed by a big rebound). The test sample shares many of these events (mid trough and long recovery), so similarity is moderate\u2013high but pickup descriptions put particularly strong emphasis on a very pronounced early trough-to-rebound and sometimes different attribution patterns. => Moderate similarity.\\n  - Label 0 (sedan): emphasizes sustained positive plateaus and broad low-frequency lobes too. The test sample exhibits plateaus and low-frequency envelope consistent with sedan features, but the label-0 descriptions emphasize certain positive plateaus as the primary distinctive cue and sometimes shallower troughs compared to the very deep trough observed here. => Moderate similarity.\\n  - Label 3 (SUV): tends to highlight a distinctive long, high-amplitude mid rising shoulder (valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded peak) and often a large, early mid-rise that is most diagnostic. While the sample contains a mid-rise, the combination (the very deep late trough and the overall shape) matches label-2 references better than SUV-specific motifs. => Low similarity.\\n\\nNumeric similarity scores (1\u20134) to each label (justification above):\\n  - label 0 (sedan): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 shared low-frequency plateaus but not the strongest match)\\n  - label 1 (pickup): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 shares trough\u2192rebound motifs but less exact timing/attribution than label 2)\\n  - label 2 (minivan): 4 (high similarity \u2014 waveform, timing of mid-crest and dominant deep rear trough plus final recovery align very closely; similar training examples are labeled 2)\\n  - label 3 (SUV): 1 (low/no similarity \u2014 SUV patterns emphasize a different dominant mid-rise/shoulder signature and SHAP patterns differ)\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with training references and final decision reasoning:\\n  - Multiple provided reference examples that are visually extremely similar (Samples 58 and 25) are labeled 2 and their SHAP/STFT patterns and time-series lobes match the test sample closely: same low-frequency energy concentration, same mid-sequence plateau and a deep later trough followed by a strong recovery. Two other similar references labeled 1 (Samples 14 and 15) also look similar, but their SHAP emphasis and the textual summaries show subtle differences in where the model places the strongest positive weight (pickups emphasize the rebound windows somewhat differently). The dissimilar references (Samples 59 and 51) have different mid-structure or SHAP distributions that do not match the test case as well.\\n  - Considering the exact combination of features (mid positive plateau centered ~250\u2013320 with low volatility, a dominant deep trough near ~400\u2013440, and a sustained final recovery to a high positive endpoint) together with where SHAP places the strongest positive weight (low-frequency bottom-row around the mid rise and end), the best match is label 2 (minivan). The close match to provided label-2 training examples and the explicit label-2 summary that highlights the late deep trough + final recovery supports this assignment.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 2 (minivan).

Using the main time-series plot, that red band maps to the interval where the series sits at a local negative extreme and then turns upward: a trough centered near t \u2248 175\u2013185 with amplitude \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6. The trough is smooth, low volatility (few small wiggles) and the bottom lasts only a short span (~10\u201325 steps). Immediately after this trough there is a pronounced, sustained upward ramp from \u2248 -1.6 up to about +1.4 to +1.5 by roughly t \u2248 280\u2013310. The rise magnitude is \u2248 3.0 units over ~120\u2013130 steps (average slope \u2248 +0.02\u2013+0.03 units/step) \u2014 a clear, low-frequency, large-amplitude rebound. Small high-frequency micro-bumps are visible on the rising limb and near the peak, but the STFT shows energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin during this interval, confirming the signal content is long-timescale shape rather than short spikes. In sum: the red SHAP region corresponds to a smooth deep trough (t\u2248175\u2013185, amplitude \u2248 -1.5) followed by a steep, low-frequency rebound to a high plateau (t\u2248180\u2013310, peak \u2248 +1.4\u2013+1.6) with low localized volatility and small micro-oscillations on extrema.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 overall series characterization and relations between features:\\n- Global shape and periodicity: The trace is dominated by very-low-frequency envelope oscillations (roughly two large half-cycles across the 577 points). Major extrema: an early deep trough near t\u2248175 (described above), a major positive peak near t\u2248280\u2013315 (~+1.4\u2013+1.5), a deeper trough near t\u2248410\u2013430 (~-1.7 to -1.85), and a final steady rise to a positive plateau at the end (\u2248+1.5\u2013+1.65). STFT confirms nearly all energy in the bottom frequency bin across these windows.\\n- Volatility and slopes: Volatility is generally low (smooth curves) except for small ripples at extrema. The rise following the mid trough is among the steepest up-ramps in the series (steeper than many descents), while the later descent into the global trough is also fairly steep. This asymmetry (sharp rebound after the mid trough and later deep trough followed by a long recovery) is a salient temporal pattern.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: The classifier-relevant structure is the ordered sequence trough (mid) \u2192 steep rebound \u2192 later deep trough \u2192 long recovery to final positive plateau. The mid-trough \u2192 rebound pair is the primary, most positively attributed event ( per SHAP ), and the late trough + recovery provides additional global context (but SHAP red is strongest around the mid trough / rebound). Micro-fluctuations at peaks/troughs appear as small high-frequency content in STFT but are secondary.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 mapping to label feature summaries and initial similarity judgment:\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary highlights: a strong positive SHAP cluster centered ~t=150\u2013220 at lowest frequency corresponding to a trough-to-upward ramp, a steep ascent to a +1.4\u2013+1.6 mid-peak, and strong positive attribution also during the long recovery from the global trough to the end. This matches our sample closely: the strongest SHAP is at ~150\u2013210; the series shows a trough at ~175 then a steep rise to ~+1.4\u20131.6; the later recovery to the final plateau is present. Matching score for label 1: 4 (high similarity).\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary: emphasis on sustained low-frequency plateaus and broad lobes (deep troughs and positive plateaus), with SHAP red often focused on broad positive plateaus especially ~200\u2013300 and late positive plateau. Our sample shares many low-frequency broad-lobe characteristics and positive plateaus, but the most diagnostic SHAP-red for label 0 in the reference description emphasizes slightly different timing/shape (rounded positive plateau being the primary cue rather than a mid-trough\u2192fast rebound). Because sample 20\u2019s strongest SHAP aligns with the trough\u2192rebound event (more characteristic of label 1), similarity to label 0 is moderate. Matching score for label 0: 3 (moderate similarity).\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary: strong positive attribution typically centers on a very deep mid/late trough (e.g., t\u2248420\u2013480) and on multiple ordered low-frequency crest/trough features where the deep late trough is the single strongest positive cue. Our sample does have a deep late trough near 410\u2013430, but SHAP does not place the strongest positive mass there \u2014 SHAP\u2019s reddest region is the mid-trough\u2192rebound (t\u2248150\u2013210). Therefore overall similarity to label 2 is limited. Matching score for label 2: 2 (low similarity).\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary: emphasizes a broad, high-amplitude low-frequency upward ramp in the mid-section (e.g., ~110\u2013220 with a shoulder/rounded peak) as the strongest positive contributor; also often a very deep trough later which can be neutral or even slightly negative for SUV. Our sample\u2019s mid region does contain a strong upward ramp after a trough, but the distinctive SUV description highlights a broad valley\u2192shoulder\u2192rounded peak motif with SHAP concentrated around the rising shoulder region; in our sample the SHAP red is localized to the trough\u2192immediate rebound window (not exactly the same shoulder/rounded-peak signature). Similarity to label 3 is therefore low-to-moderate. Matching score for label 3: 2 (low similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 cross-check against reference samples and final decision justification:\\n- The provided similar reference examples labeled 1 (samples 49, 11, 14) are nearly isomorphic to sample 20: same timing for the mid trough (~150\u2013200), similar trough depth (~-1.4 to -1.6), steep rebound to ~+1.4\u20131.6, low-frequency dominance in STFT, and SHAP heatmaps that concentrate red at the same lowest-frequency / same mid-time-window. Those references strongly corroborate labeling as pickup (label 1).\\n- One of the similar references labeled 0 (the 'Sample 20, Label: 0.0' plot) visually resembles the waveform shape, but its SHAP map (for label 0) shows red more distributed and weaker in the exact trough\u2192rebound window compared with the label-1 references; the decisive factor is that the classifier\u2019s attribution (SHAP) for our current sample concentrates positive mass at the trough\u2192rebound window which matches the label-1 pattern descriptions and the label-1 reference SHAPs more closely than the label-0 SHAP pattern.\\n- Dissimilar references (labels 3 and other label 1/1 examples with different SHAP localization) further confirm that the specific combination of: (a) pronounced mid trough near t\u2248175, (b) steep low-frequency rebound to a mid peak ~280\u2013310, and (c) low-frequency energy concentrated in the bottom STFT bin at that time \u2014 is what the model has learned to use for label 1 in many training examples.\\n\\nFinal classification and numeric scoring:\\n- Final predicted class: label 1 (pickup). Rationale: the strongest SHAP attribution, low-frequency energy, trough-to-rebound timing, amplitude and slope values, and match to multiple labeled-1 reference samples align most closely and consistently with the pickup description.\\n- Confidence / similarity score for chosen label: 4 (high similarity). Supporting per-label similarity rationale (for transparency): label 1 = 4, label 0 = 3, label 2 = 2, label 3 = 2.\\n\\nSummary statement: The sample\u2019s most discriminative, SHAP-highlighted event is a smooth, deep trough at t\u2248175 followed by a relatively steep, low-frequency rebound to a high plateau (~+1.4\u2013+1.6). That trough\u2192rebound motif, with concentrated STFT energy at the lowest frequency during the event, matches the pickup (label 1) feature summary and multiple label-1 training examples very closely \u2014 therefore the correct classification is label 1 with high similarity (score = 4).\"\n  ]\n}",

In the time trace this window corresponds to a smooth, low-volatility upward transition that begins from a negative valley and moves toward zero/positive values. Measured manifestations: amplitude moves from about -1.4\u2026-1.6 near the trough up to roughly -0.1\u2026+0.2 by the end of the red window (net change \u2248 +1.4 to +1.8 over \u224850\u201360 time steps). The rise is steady (no abrupt spikes), the local volatility is low (only tiny superposed jiggles of a few hundredths), and the local slope is clearly positive and relatively steep compared with the longer ramps elsewhere. STFT confirms this event is dominated by the lowest frequency bin (little to no mid/high frequency energy within the red window), indicating a long-timescale, envelope-scale feature. Substructure: small micro\u2011ripples at the shoulder of the rise (visible on the top flank) but no sharp high\u2011frequency spikes. Shape: a classic trough-to-ramp half-cycle (smooth convex ascent) that the model attaches positive evidence to (red at bottom-frequency row).\\n\\nStep 1 \u2014 Secondary red contributions (minor):\\n- Smaller, less intense red patches also appear at low frequency near the later recovery (post trough at \u2248420) and around the mid-to-late peak region, but the dominant positive attribution is the trough\u2192ramp interval around 157\u2013209. Those secondary low-frequency red patches map to the larger rebound later in the series but are weaker than the main mid-rise.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and dependencies:\\n- Global envelope: the trace is dominated by very low-frequency oscillations (two main long half-cycles over the 577 points). The STFT shows almost all energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin, consistent with long-wavelength silhouette features.\\n- Key extrema/timing: (1) an early descent from \u2248+1.6 down to a pre-mid trough near -1.4\u2026-1.6 (around t\u2248160\u2013190), (2) a strong, smooth rise that peaks near +1.4\u2026+1.6 around t\u2248280\u2013315, (3) a steep descent to a deep trough near -1.6\u2026-1.8 at \u2248420, (4) a sustained monotonic rise from that trough to a final plateau \u2248+1.5 at the series end. The largest negative excursion is the trough around 420, and there is also a clear mid-sequence peak.\\n- Volatility: low overall; noise is confined to small ripples at extrema and shoulders. Slopes are asymmetric: the mid-rise is relatively sharp/steep, the following descent to the deep trough is also steep, and the final recovery is a long smooth ramp.\\n- Temporal dependence: classification-relevant events occur in sequence \u2014 an early trough followed by a pronounced mid-ramp/peak and then a deep trough followed by final recovery. The model\u2019s SHAP focuses on the trough\u2192mid-ramp event (\u2248157\u2013209) as the most diagnostic, indicating reliance on a specific phase of the long-wave oscillation rather than isolated values.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries (which label best fits?):\\n- Label 1 (pickup): The label_1 description emphasizes strong positive SHAP concentrated around an upward recovery in the \u2248150\u2013220 window, a steep ascent to a mid-peak (~+1.4\u2013+1.6), and a later deep trough with a long recovery to the end. Our sample matches these points closely: the main SHAP-red region is exactly in the 150\u2013220 window; the mid-rise and later deep trough + long final recovery are present in the series; STFT low-frequency dominance also matches. => High match.\\n- Label 0 (sedan): Sedan summaries emphasize low-frequency broad lobes with positive plateaus and SHAP at slow upward transitions (some overlap). Our series shares low-frequency broad lobes and terminal positive plateau, but the prominent trough\u2192sharp mid-rise pairing and the strong SHAP focus at 157\u2013209 is more characteristic of pickup descriptions than the sedan emphasis on sustained positive plateaus as the primary cue. => Moderate match.\\n- Label 2 (minivan): Minivan descriptions stress an especially strong late deep trough (around \u2248420\u2013470) as the main SHAP-positive region. While our series does have a deep trough near \u2248420, the SHAP heatmap does not place the strongest positive attribution there \u2014 it places the strongest positive mass in the mid-rise around 157\u2013209. Therefore the sample only partially matches label_2. => Low-to-moderate match.\\n- Label 3 (SUV): SUV descriptions also call out a long, high-amplitude mid-section rise (\u2248110\u2013220) as discriminative; this is similar to our mid-rise. However SUV summaries tend to emphasize a particular rounded shoulder + peak structure and treat the later deep trough as neutral/negative, while our SHAP explicitly favors the trough\u2192midrise interval and later deep trough is less positively attributed. Several reference samples labeled 3 show different SHAP patterns (less focused at the 157\u2013209 window than we observe). => Low-to-moderate match.\\n\\nPreliminary label choice: label 1 (pickup) is the best fit because (a) the SHAP-red localization (\u2248157\u2013209 at lowest frequency) is a key pickup signature in the provided summaries, (b) the time-domain trough\u2192steep ascent\u2192mid-peak\u2192deep trough\u2192long recovery structure strongly parallels label_1 examples, and (c) multiple retrieved similar training samples with the closest curve/SHAP pattern are labeled 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final similarity scoring:\\n- The four closest/most similar references presented include three labeled 1 and one labeled 0. The three label-1 references (samples 49, 11, 14) show very similar overall envelope, similar mid-sequence trough-to-rise morphology and bottom-frequency SHAP red clusters located in the same mid-window \u2014 supporting label 1. The label-0 similar sample (one shown) is visually close but its SHAP and some substructure (timing of strongest attribution) differ from our sample, and the training set majority of similar examples are label 1, which reinforces the pickup decision.\\n\\nPer-label similarity scores (1\u20134 scale):\\n- label 0 (sedan): 3 \u2014 Several broad low-frequency traits and end plateau are shared, but the precise SHAP localization and the steep trough\u2192rise signature are more pickup-like than the sedan examples emphasize.\\n- label 1 (pickup): 4 \u2014 High similarity: exact SHAP timing (\u2248150\u2013220 low\u2011freq red), trough\u2192sharp ascent to a mid-peak, deep later trough + long recovery match the pickup pattern descriptions and the close reference samples labeled 1.\\n- label 2 (minivan): 2 \u2014 The series contains a deep late trough, but SHAP\u2019s strongest attribution is earlier (\u2248157\u2013209) rather than primarily at the late trough as the minivan pattern requires; therefore only weak support.\\n- label 3 (SUV): 2 \u2014 The mid-rise resemblance gives some similarity, but SUV descriptions emphasize a different combination (rounded shoulder top and different SHAP emphasis) and the provided dissimilar SUV reference shows differing SHAP/shape detail; overall only limited match.\\n\\nFinal verification: after rechecking the detailed time-domain points, STFT (low-frequency dominance), SHAP focal window, and the retrieved reference examples, label 1 (pickup) remains the most consistent classification. The chosen score (4) equals the high similarity rating for label 1. The per-label similarity breakdown above documents graded confidence for other categories.\"\n    ]\n}"

On the time trace this maps to the trough \u2192 mid\u2011rise interval. Detailed features: amplitude rises from about -1.15 (local trough around t\u2248170\u2013190) up to roughly +1.3\u2013+1.5 (local peak reached around t\u2248270\u2013300). The net change is large (~2.4\u20132.7 units) over ~80\u2013120 time steps giving an average slope roughly +0.02\u2013+0.03 units/step. The ramp is smooth (low volatility) with only small superimposed micro\u2011bumps near the crest (small high\u2011frequency ripples visible as tiny jagged deviations). STFT: energy in this interval is concentrated in the lowest frequency bin(s), confirming this is a long-timescale, low\u2011frequency shape change rather than a high\u2011frequency transient. This low\u2011frequency, high\u2011amplitude trough\u2192rise is the main positive evidence region.\\n- Secondary positive (red) SHAP around the end: weaker but present in the lowest-frequency band near t \u2248 520\u2013576. On the trace this corresponds to the terminal recovery/plateau: the signal climbs from the deep trough (~-1.5 at t\u2248410\u2013430) back up to ~+1.6 by the end. Characteristics: a long, sustained monotonic rise, smooth, low volatility, amplitude change ~3.0 units over ~150 steps (avg slope \u2248 0.02). STFT again shows energy concentrated at the bottom frequency bin here. SHAP marks this terminal low\u2011frequency recovery as additional positive evidence.\\n- Neutral / slightly negative SHAP region: around the deep trough (t \u2248 360\u2013440) the SHAP map contains pale blue/neutral entries. In the time plot this is the steep descent to the global minimum near -1.5 to -1.7 (deep trough). That trough is wide and smooth (low high\u2011frequency content) but the model assigns it little or slightly negative attribution here, consistent with the SHAP colors.\\n- Microstructure: all red regions occur at lowest frequencies; micro\u2011ripples at extrema are visible as very small amplitude, short-duration deviations and appear weak in STFT (slight energy in slightly higher bins). SHAP gives these micro\u2011ripples little direct positive weight \u2014 they act as secondary timing/shape cues only.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall feature summary and temporal dependence:\\n- Dominant behavior: the series is dominated by very-low-frequency, long-wavelength structure (STFT energy concentrated near 0 Hz). The trace contains roughly two long half-cycles over the 577 points: an initial high \u2192 broad descent \u2192 shallow trough around t\u2248150\u2013190; a strong low\u2011frequency ascent to a mid positive peak around t\u2248260\u2013300; a steep descent to a deep trough centered ~410\u2013430; and a final long recovery to a terminal positive plateau by t\u2248576.\\n- Trends & asymmetry: the mid\u2011sequence rise (trough\u2192peak) is the steepest ascent in the record (relatively fast low\u2011frequency rebound), while the subsequent fall into the deep trough is also steep. The final recovery is long and steady. Local volatility is low overall; only small, high\u2011frequency ripples occur at peaks/troughs.\\n- Time-series dependence / combination: the classifier appears to rely on the ordered sequence trough \u2192 steep low-frequency rise \u2192 rounded mid-peak \u2192 deep trough \u2192 sustained recovery. The positive SHAP mass concentrated on the mid-rise and final recovery indicates the model favors presence and timing of those upward transitions, not the deep negative excursion in isolation. That ordering (early trough + strong mid-rise + final rebound) is a composite signature in this sample.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare to label feature summaries and select best match (quantified similarity decision):\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary highlights: strong positive SHAP over a trough\u2192sustained low-frequency upward ramp around t\u2248150\u2013220, a steep low-frequency ascent to a mid-peak, a deep trough later, and a long recovery to a final positive plateau. This matches the sample closely: the sample\u2019s strongest SHAP is exactly on the trough\u2192mid-rise window (~150\u2013220), and it also exhibits the late deep trough followed by a long recovery to a positive plateau. Temporal positions, amplitude ranges (large trough-to-peak swings ~2\u20133 units), low-frequency dominance, and the model's attribution pattern are all highly consistent. Therefore label 1 is the strongest match.\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary: sedans emphasize smooth broad lobes, positive plateaus and low-frequency envelope with SHAP concentrated on positive plateaus (notably around 200\u2013280 and end). Sample shares some features (low-frequency plateaus at mid and end), but pickup summary emphasizes steep mid-ascent and the diagnostic deep trough + final long recovery \u2014 the sample\u2019s strong trough\u2192rise and large recovery are more characteristic of pickup than sedan. Similarity is present but weaker than for label 1.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary: minivan emphasizes a very strong, dominant deep rear trough (centered ~420\u2013470) as the primary positive SHAP feature. Our sample does have a deep trough in that window, but SHAP for the sample assigns only neutral/weak negative weight to that trough while assigning positive weight to the earlier mid-rise and the final recovery. Thus the sample shares the deep-trough morphology but not the attribution pattern that defines minivan in the summary. Similarity is limited.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary: SUV focuses on a long, strong mid-rise/shoulder (t\u2248110\u2013220) as positive evidence plus a rounded peak; again some similarity exists because our sample has a marked mid-rise, but label 3 descriptions also place different emphasis (and some SUV samples show deeper troughs contributing differently). Overall pickup\u2019s combined trough\u2192rise\u2192final recovery pattern fits the sample better.\\n\\nQuantified preliminary similarity (before cross-check): label1: highest (4), label0: moderate (3), label2: low\u2013moderate (2), label3: low\u2013moderate (2).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four similar reference samples provided are all labeled 1 and their traces + SHAP maps closely match the structure of the test sample: (1) strong low-frequency trough around ~150\u2013200 with a steep, well-attributed rise to a broad mid-peak (~260\u2013300), and (2) late deep trough followed by a long recovery to the end. Their SHAP heatmaps emphasize the same lowest-frequency bands around the mid-rise and show similar attribution patterns. Visually the amplitude ranges, slopes, and micro-structure correspond almost one-to-one with the test sample.\\n- Dissimilar references (one labeled 3 with different mid\u2011cycle morphology and one labeled 1 but with different attribution details) do not contradict the assignment; they reinforce that the pickup cluster in the training set contains the exact trough\u2192rise and long final recovery signature we observe.\\n- The scoring logic is consistent: because the test sample exhibits the principal elements the label 1 summary calls out (diagnostic trough\u2192steep mid-ascent with concentrated lowest\u2011frequency SHAP, plus a long terminal recovery also positively attributed), it meets the criteria for 'high similarity' (4/4) to label 1. For the other labels there are partial overlaps (low-frequency lobes, troughs), but either the timing, the attribution pattern, or which feature is emphasized by SHAP differs enough to reduce similarity scores.\\n\\nFinal decision (after careful verification):\\n- Predicted label: label 1 (pickup).\\n- Similarity score (to the chosen label): 4 (high similarity).\"\n    ]\n}",

Our sample's distinctive steep trough\u2192midrise and the SHAP strong red at that trough/ascend are more aligned with pickup than sedan.\",\n    \"- Label 2 (minivan): minivan summaries highlight a very strong late deep trough (around t\u2248420\u2013460) as the primary positive cue (SHAP red concentrated on that late trough).

On the time trace that window covers the deep negative extremum and the start of the following recovery. Precisely: the series reaches a local trough near t \u2248 180\u2013190 with amplitude about -1.6 (minimum \u2248 -1.5 to -1.7) and then begins a smooth, sustained rise through the SHAP window. Over the red window the amplitude change is on the order of ~1.6\u20131.8 units (from ~-1.6 up toward near-zero / small positive values), producing an average slope in that local window on the order of \u2248 +0.03\u2013+0.04 units per step (steep relative to the long low-frequency envelope).\\n- Volatility & substructure: the rise is low-volatility and smooth (dominant low-frequency curvature) with small, localized micro-ripples (tiny high-frequency bumps) superimposed at the trough and early rising flank. These micro-ripples are low amplitude (hundredths to few tenths) and do not dominate the shape. The red SHAP attribution is concentrated in the bottom-frequency row, indicating the model attributes the feature to slow envelope/shape (not high-frequency texture).\\n- Shape & trend: the red region corresponds to a long low-frequency half-cycle 'deep trough \u2192 rapid low-frequency rebound' motif: a wide smooth trough at ~t\u2248180 followed by a relatively fast, monotonic upward ramp. The STFT confirms most energy is in the lowest band during this interval (bright bottom-row energy aligned with the same time range).\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Global envelope: the sample is dominated by long-wavelength, low-frequency oscillations (roughly two main half-cycles across the 577 points). The STFT shows nearly all measurable energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins.\\n- Sequence of macro-events: (1) initial high baseline at the left edge (~+1.6) and a smooth descent into a first trough (t \u2248 150\u2013190), (2) a strong, relatively rapid low-frequency ascent to a rounded positive peak/plateau centered roughly t \u2248 260\u2013320 (peak near +1.3 to +1.5), (3) a long descent to a later deep trough around t \u2248 410\u2013440 (amplitude ~ -1.5 to -1.65), and (4) a final smooth recovery/monotonic rise to a high positive level at the right edge (~+1.6). Overall volatility is low; most transitions are smooth and slow with small micro-ripples concentrated at extrema.\\n- Timing / dependence: the model appears to rely on the ordered pattern 'deep trough \u2192 steep low-frequency rebound \u2192 mid positive plateau \u2192 subsequent descent \u2192 final recovery' rather than on isolated spikes. The red SHAP window on the early trough-to-rise indicates that that particular trough\u2192rebound half-cycle is most decisive for the classifier.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and initial scoring:\\n- Label 1 (pickup) match: The sample exhibits the classic pickup signature described in the label_1 notes: a pronounced trough in the mid- to early-mid sequence followed by a relatively steep low-frequency rebound (strong positive SHAP on the trough\u2192rise), and a late long recovery to a positive plateau. The red SHAP localization around t\u2248157\u2013209 (bottom frequency) is exactly the region label_1 descriptions highlight as the discriminative trough\u2192rebound. STFT low-frequency dominance and the slope magnitudes align well with label_1's documented pattern (steep mid-ascent, deep trough then long recovery). => High similarity.\\n- Label 0 (sedan) comparison: sedans are described as dominated by low-frequency lobes with positive plateaus and some support from micro-ripples at extrema. Our sample does share low-frequency lobes and plateaus, but the SHAP emphasis for sedans normally aligns more strongly with later positive plateaus and different weighting around the deep negative valley. The strongest red evidence in this sample is on the trough\u2192rise (more characteristic of pickup). => Low-to-moderate similarity.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) comparison: minivan summaries emphasize a very strong deep late trough (often the strongest positive cue) and a set of ordered crest/trough elements with the largest SHAP at the deep rear trough. While sample 23 has a deep trough later (t \u2248 410\u2013440), SHAP does not emphasize that later trough; instead SHAP points at the earlier trough\u2192rebound. That discrepancy makes the match to label 2 weaker. => Low similarity.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) comparison: SUVs show a strong long low-frequency upward ramp/shoulder in the mid-section (t \u2248 110\u2013220) with SHAP red often on that long ascent. Our sample does have a strong mid-ascent, but the decisive SHAP red is centered on the trough-to-rise around t\u2248157\u2013209 and the overall shape (paired deep trough then fast rebound then final recovery) is more consistent with pickup examples in the references. Also SUV-class examples often contain a later very deep trough with different attribution patterns than here. => Low-to-moderate similarity.\\n- Numerical similarity scores (per requested rubric): label_0: 2, label_1: 4, label_2: 2, label_3: 2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against reference examples and final verification:\\n- The four nearest/similar reference examples provided (samples labeled 4, 11, 49 and 14) are all label 1 and their time-traces + STFT + SHAP maps are visually and functionally very similar to sample 23: same initial descent to a mid trough, the trough\u2192rapid low-frequency rebound emphasized by SHAP at the lowest frequency band (~t\u2248157\u2013209), a rounded mid peak and a deep later trough followed by final recovery. The red SHAP patches in those references align with the same trough\u2192rise interval and occupy the same low-frequency row \u2014 precisely the pattern we observe in the test sample. This strongly supports label 1.\\n- The dissimilar examples (sample 51 labeled 3 and sample 59 labeled 1 but with different attribution patterns) help to check edge cases: sample 51 (label 3) shows different attribution (mid-rise shoulder and other differences in amplitude/depth) and sample 59 shows mixed SHAP with more distributed low-frequency contribution; these look different from sample 23's concentrated red near the early-mid trough. That reinforces the selection of label 1 for sample 23 rather than label 3 or 2.\\n\\nConclusion (final classification):\\n- Best matching label: label 1 (pickup). Rationale: SHAP strongly highlights a low-frequency deep trough followed by a steep, smooth low-frequency rebound in the interval t \u2248 157\u2013209; the STFT shows energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins; the global envelope (trough\u2192rebound\u2192rounded mid-peak\u2192deep later trough\u2192final recovery) and the exact red localization mirror the reference label_1 examples and the label_1 feature description. All cross-checks with reference samples confirm the match.\\n\\nPer the requested output format, I therefore return label 1 with a top similarity score of 4 (high similarity).

      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 1\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local feature (map SHAP red -> time plot + STFT):\\n- SHAP attention: The strongest red region in the SHAP heatmap is concentrated at the lowest frequency row between roughly t \u2248 150 and t \u2248 220. There are weaker positive pixels near the low-frequency band around t \u2248 260\u2013320 and small positive patches near the very end, but the dominant positive attribution is the low-frequency band in the 150\u2013220 window.\\n- Corresponding time-series feature (t \u2248 150\u2013220): In the signal this interval covers the valley bottom and the start of a pronounced upward transition. Specifically: amplitude at the start of the window is about -1.1 to -1.5 (minimum near ~180\u2013200 \u2248 -1.5), then the series reverses and begins a steady, low-volatility upward ramp. The trough is broad (spans many tens of steps), smooth (very low high-frequency jitter on the bottom), and followed by a sustained, monotonic rise.\\n  - Amplitude: trough values \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6; subsequent rise proceeds to positive amplitudes \u2248 +1.0\u2013+1.6 later in the record.\\n  - Time range: main red window \u2248 t = 150\u2013220 (trough + early rebound). Adjacent low-frequency positive energy continues through t \u2248 220\u2013320 as the rise reaches its peak.\\n  - Volatility: low local volatility; micro-ripples present at the trough bottom and on the rising flank but these are small compared with the large low-frequency swing (STFT confirms energy concentrated in the bottom bin).\\n  - Change rate / slope: the rise after the trough is relatively steep for a low-frequency feature (average slope roughly +0.02\u2013+0.035 units/step over the 150\u2013300 interval), while the descent into the trough before t\u2248150 is a moderate negative slope (~ -0.015 to -0.02 units/step). This slope asymmetry (faster rise after trough) is visible.\\n  - Shape / substructure: the trough is broad and U-shaped (not a sharp spike) with a smooth bottom; the subsequent rising limb is steady and forms a large low-frequency half-cycle that reaches a rounded positive plateau later. The STFT shows almost all energy in the lowest frequency bin during these events, supporting that these are long-timescale envelope features rather than fast transients.\\n- Additional SHAP-positive regions: small positive pixels at low frequency around the later rise toward the end. These correspond to the long recovery from the second deep trough (t \u2248 380\u2013440) up to the end. They are supportive but not the primary SHAP driver for the classification.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Global waveform: The series is dominated by very-low-frequency, long-wavelength oscillations (about two large half-cycles across 577 steps). The main pattern is: initial high (~+1.5) \u2192 smooth decline to a first trough (~ -1.1 to -1.5 around t \u2248 160\u2013200) \u2192 strong, sustained rise to a mid/late positive peak (~ +1.4\u2013+1.6 around t \u2248 280\u2013320) \u2192 pronounced decline to a deep trough (~ -1.5 around t \u2248 410\u2013440) \u2192 final steady climb to a positive plateau at the end (~ +1.5).\\n- Volatility: Low overall; the curve is smooth with small, localized micro-ripples at extrema and transition flanks. STFT shows energy concentrated in the bottom frequency bins; higher frequencies are negligible except for tiny bursts at extrema.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: The classifier-relevant sequence is the trough \u2192 rapid recovery \u2192 sustained positive plateau. The strong low-frequency trough around t\u2248150\u2013200 and the following ascent are temporally earlier than the later deep trough/recovery; SHAP indicates the model weights the earlier trough\u2192rebound most strongly for this sample. The slope asymmetry (steeper upward rebound vs. earlier descent) and the large amplitude change across the trough-to-peak half-cycle are key.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries (select best label and similarity scoring):\\n- Match to label 1 (pickup): High match. The label-1 summary repeatedly emphasizes a deep trough in the mid-sequence (t\u2248150\u2013220) followed by a steep, large-amplitude low-frequency ascent to a mid/late positive peak, and then a broad recovery to the end. SHAP for this sample highlights the trough\u2192recovery in the same low-frequency band and same time window (\u2248150\u2013220) as the label-1 characteristic. The slope magnitudes, trough depth (~ -1.5 to -1.7), the steep mid-rise, and the final recovery plateau match label-1 descriptions and the provided similar reference samples (Samples 49, 31, 15, 56) which are all labeled 1 and show very similar waveforms and SHAP low-frequency emphasis. Therefore similarity to label 1 = 4 (high similarity).\\n- Match to label 0 (sedan): Moderate match. Sedans are described as having dominant low-frequency lobes with positive plateaus and sustained rises (notably positive plateaus around t\u2248200\u2013300 and end). Some sedan descriptions emphasize positive plateaus and slow upward transitions that are positively attributed. Our sample does have a strong low-frequency positive plateau mid-to-late and a final positive plateau, but the most strongly attributed event in this sample is the deep trough\u2192rebound at t\u2248150\u2013220 which label-0 summaries treat differently (sedan summaries put more emphasis on broad positive lobes and smaller troughs). Thus there is overlap (low-frequency envelope, positive plateaus), but the key discriminative trough\u2192steep rebound pattern aligns better with pickup. Therefore similarity to label 0 = 3 (moderate).\\n- Match to label 2 (minivan): Low similarity. Minivan summaries emphasize a dominant deep late trough (t\u2248420\u2013470) with the strongest SHAP attribution at that late trough. Although this sample does have a deep trough around t\u2248410\u2013440, the SHAP for this sample does not concentrate positive attribution there \u2014 the model\u2019s SHAP instead highlights the earlier trough\u2192rebound at t\u2248150\u2013220. Because the primary attributed region and timing differ (minivan expects the late trough to be the main cue, but here the early trough\u2192rebound is the main cue), similarity to label 2 = 2 (low).\\n- Match to label 3 (SUV): Low-to-moderate similarity. SUV descriptions emphasize a long, high-amplitude low-frequency upward ramp in the midsection (t\u2248110\u2013220) culminating in a rounded plateau/shoulder. That is similar to the mid-rise we see here; however, SUV SHAP in reference summaries centers positive attribution strongly on the long upward mid-shoulder (and typically gives mixed/neutral weight to the deep troughs). In our sample the SHAP red is focused on the trough and early rebound rather than an extended shoulder as the sole diagnostic. Also the training reference for SUV (dissimilar sample 51) shows different detailed timing of attribution. Thus similarity to label 3 = 2 (low-to-moderate).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four most similar reference plots provided (Samples 49, 31, 15, 56) are all labeled 1 and are visually and structurally almost identical to sample 25: initial positive offset, descent to a broad trough near t\u2248150\u2013200, then a steep low-frequency ascent to a rounded positive peak mid-sequence, then a deep later trough and final recovery. Their STFTs show bottom-bin energy and their SHAP heatmaps highlight the low-frequency band in the same mid-window (\u2248150\u2013220). Sample 25 matches these references on (1) trough depth and width, (2) timing of trough and rebound, (3) slope asymmetry (rebound steeper than descent), (4) STFT energy concentrated at the lowest frequencies, and (5) SHAP localization to the same low-frequency time window. That strongly supports label 1.\\n- The dissimilar references (sample 51 labeled 3, sample 59 labeled 1 but shown as dissimilar in retrieval) help verify sensitivity to where SHAP focuses: when the SHAP red is centered on a mid-rise/shoulder (SUV) the classifier leans SUV; when it is centered on the trough\u2192rebound pair (as for sample 25 and the label-1 references) it leans pickup. For sample 25, SHAP localization and waveform timing align with the pickup prototypes.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification:\\n- Chosen label: label 1 (pickup). Rationale: the dominant, SHAP-highlighted event (deep mid-sequence trough around t\u2248150\u2013220 followed by a relatively rapid, large-amplitude low-frequency ascent to a mid/late positive peak and eventual final recovery) matches the pickup class descriptions and the provided pickup reference samples almost exactly. STFT confirms discriminative energy at the lowest frequencies, consistent with the model\u2019s learned cues for pickup. Microstructure (small ripples) is present but secondary.\\n- Confidence score: 4 (high similarity) \u2014 the sample\u2019s primary morphological features, timing and SHAP attribution align closely with label 1 examples and textual feature summary.\\n\\nSimilarity summary (for transparency): label 0 = 3, label 1 = 4, label 2 = 2, label 3 = 2.\"\n  ]\n}"

There are only small, scattered pale red patches elsewhere at the lowest-frequency row, but the dominant attribution is the late recovery window near t\u2248470.\\n- Corresponding time-series manifestation (t \u2248 418\u2192523): The plot shows a deep trough centered about t\u2248410\u2013420 with minimum \u2248 -1.6 to -1.75, followed by a smooth, sustained recovery from that trough beginning ~t\u2248420. The signal climbs from ~-1.7 up through zero near t\u2248470 and reaches positive values approaching +1.0 by ~t\u2248500 and then up to \u2248+1.4\u2013+1.6 toward the series end (~t=576). This recovery is low-volatility (smooth) and long-duration (~100+ time steps from trough to late plateau). The SHAP red aligns with the rising limb and crossing of zero (the trough\u2192rebound interval). \\n- Fine-grained measures for the red window: amplitude change \u2248 2.8\u20133.2 units (from trough \u22121.7 to final +1.5), average slope on the major rebound \u2248 +0.02\u2013+0.03 units/step over ~156 steps (420\u2192576), and low short-term volatility (few small high-frequency ripples only at extrema). STFT corroboration: the STFT shows energy concentrated at the lowest frequencies across time, with higher low-frequency magnitudes aligned with the large amplitude half-cycles (not high-frequency bands), confirming the red SHAP band corresponds to slow, large-scale shape changes rather than fast oscillations.\\n- Secondary local structure: earlier in the trace there is a broad negative trough around t\u224880\u2013160 (\u2248 -1.0 to -1.2) and a pronounced mid-sequence ascent to a positive peak near t\u2248250\u2013300 (+1.4 to +1.6) with a rounded plateau. SHAP does not strongly highlight those mid/early segments; the late trough\u2192recovery is the main positive contributor.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall signal description and temporal dependence:\\n- Global envelope: The time series is dominated by very-low-frequency structure (roughly two long half-cycles across 577 points): (1) early high \u2192 descent \u2192 early trough (~t=80\u2013160), (2) rise to mid positive peak (~t=250\u2013300), (3) steep descent to deep trough (~t\u2248410\u2013420), (4) long recovery to the end (~t\u2248420\u2013576). The STFT confirms most energy at the lowest frequency bin throughout.\\n- Volatility and substructure: Volatility is low overall; micro-ripples of small amplitude appear at peaks/trough bottoms and inflection points. The series shows asymmetric slopes: the ascent to the mid peak is relatively steep, the descent into the central deep trough is also relatively steep, and the final recovery is long and sustained. This ordering (deep trough followed by extended rebound) creates clear temporal dependence: the late recovery consolidates the class evidence for the model (as SHAP shows).\\n- Combination & discrimination: The classifier appears to rely primarily on the timing, amplitude and duration of the large slow half-cycles (especially trough-to-recovery events) rather than small, high-frequency detail. The sample\u2019s late trough + prolonged recovery forms the strongest single-piece evidence.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists (candidate labels):\\n- Label 1 (pickup): Summary emphasizes a deep trough followed by a strong, sustained rebound and positive SHAP concentrated on trough\u2192recovery windows. Typical pickup patterns: initial high \u2192 descent \u2192 pronounced mid trough and a later global trough followed by a long recovery to a positive plateau; SHAP concentrated on the rebound (often around the late recovery). The test sample\u2019s most salient SHAP red is exactly the late trough\u2192rebound (t\u2248420\u2192576), amplitude and slopes match the pickup descriptions, STFT low-frequency dominance matches, and several reference training examples labeled 1 show near-identical morphology. High correspondence.\\n- Label 0 (sedan): Summary emphasizes dominant low-frequency oscillation with positive plateaus near middle and end; sedans emphasize positive plateaus and slow upward transitions earlier (~150\u2013280) and in multiple windows. Our sample does have mid positive plateau (~250\u2013300) and an end plateau, but SHAP indicates the model attributes much more weight to the late trough\u2192recovery than to mid plateaus. Sedans were described as prioritizing positive plateaus and smaller troughs; here the deep trough and its recovery are more characteristic of pickups. Moderate-to-low correspondence.\\n- Label 2 (minivan): Summary highlights very-low-frequency structure with a dominant deep trough around t\u2248420\u2013470 that is strongly positive for minivan in some examples. There is partial overlap: minivan descriptions also emphasize a late deep trough and strong recovery. However, minivan narratives often include multiple alternating crests/troughs with a prominent late deep trough being the primary positive cue; the reference minivan examples tended to show the deepest trough as the strongest positive evidence at the low-frequency band. Our sample\u2019s late trough is large, so there is some similarity; but the explicit SHAP emphasis in this sample (and the resemblance to many labeled-1 training examples) points stronger to pickup. Moderate correspondence.\\n- Label 3 (SUV): Summary emphasizes a strong long low-frequency rise in the midsection (t\u2248110\u2013220) with a broad shoulder/rounded peak as the key positive cue. Our test sample does have a mid rise/rounded mid-peak, but SHAP in this sample is not concentrated on that mid-rise \u2014 the model\u2019s strongest positive attribution is the late recovery. Therefore, while the raw shape shares features with SUV patterns, the attribution pattern favors pickup. Moderate-to-low correspondence.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Reference-sample cross-check and final decision:\\n- Visual comparison to provided similar reference samples: Several provided 'similar' examples labeled 1 (samples 2, 38, 43) closely match sample 29 in both raw waveform shape (initial descent, mid positive plateau around 260\u2013300, deep trough near ~420, long rebound to positive end) and in the SHAP pattern (late low-frequency red attribution). Sample 46 (label 3) is visually similar too, but its SHAP emphasis differs (SUV examples often show stronger mid-rise attribution). The two dissimilar examples labeled 2 show more irregular multi-crest patterns and different attribution maps.\\n- Fairness & scoring: Because the test waveform geometry, the low-frequency STFT energy distribution, and \u2014 critically \u2014 the SHAP attribution focused on the trough\u2192rebound window match the pickup description and multiple pickup reference examples almost exactly, label 1 is the best match. Label similarity scores (per the given 1\u20134 rubric) I assign as follows after the above comparisons: label 1 = 4 (high similarity), label 2 = 2 (low\u2013moderate similarity: shares deep trough but attribution and contextual ordering favor pickup), label 3 = 3 (moderate similarity: waveform shares mid-rise/peak but the model\u2019s positive attribution does not), label 0 = 2 (low similarity: some end-plateau resemblance but key SHAP regions and trough\u2192recovery emphasis differ).\\n\\nFinal classification: label 1 (pickup). The single reported score is 4 (high similarity) reflecting the strong match between the sample\u2019s dominant discriminative feature (late trough followed by a long, low-frequency recovery) and the label-1 feature pattern and reference examples.\"\n  ]\n}",

Micro-features (short blips ~20\u201330 steps) are present but are minor.\\n- Temporal dependence: the classifier-relevant pattern is the ordered sequence: trough \u2192 steep low-frequency ascent \u2192 rounded peak \u2192 descent \u2192 deep trough \u2192 sustained recovery. The SHAP attribution concentrates on the trough\u2192recovery events (especially the final recovery), indicating the model values large amplitude, low-frequency rebounds and plateaus in this time order.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and preliminary scoring:\\n- Label 1 (pickup): The pickup summary emphasizes a pronounced mid-sequence deep trough followed by a strong, sustained low-frequency recovery to a final positive plateau, plus a steep mid-rise earlier. Sample 29 contains all of these: (1) mid-rise to a high mid-peak (~260\u2013280), (2) descent to a deep trough (~410\u2013420), (3) robust recovery to final plateau. SHAP red localization is also centered on the recovery and mid-rise, matching label 1's described positive attribution. => similarity = 4 (high).\\n- Label 2 (minivan): minivan summaries stress a very deep late trough and a final steep rise; this also appears in the sample. However, minivan descriptions often emphasize a different arrangement of mid-features (e.g., specific front bulge + dominant late trough as the main cue) and sometimes slightly different SHAP localization. Sample 29 shares some elements (deep trough + final recovery) but the strong mid-rise prior and SHAP emphasis pattern align more with pickup. => similarity = 3 (moderate).\\n- Label 3 (SUV): SUV summaries highlight a long, high-amplitude mid-section upward shoulder (t\u2248110\u2013220) with strong positive attribution; sample 29 has a mid-rise/rounded peak in that band, but the SUV pattern tends to place greatest positive weight on that mid-shoulder rather than the late trough\u2192recovery. In sample 29 the strongest SHAP is at the late recovery, so SUV is plausible but less consistent than pickup. => similarity = 3 (moderate).\\n- Label 0 (sedan): sedan emphasizes dominant low-frequency lobes and sustained positive plateaus, but in the sedan summary the deepest troughs are often neutral or slightly negative in attribution (the model favors positive plateaus over extreme negative excursions). Sample 29's deep trough followed by a strong recovery (and SHAP focused on the recovery) matches pickup more than the sedan signature. => similarity = 2 (low).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference exemplars:\\n- The three reference samples labeled 1 (Samples 2, 38, 43) have highly similar shapes: initial high \u2192 mid-rise plateau around 260\u2013280 \u2192 descent to a deep trough near \u2248420 \u2192 strong recovery to final plateau. Their STFTs and SHAP maps show low-frequency power in the same windows and red attribution on the mid-rise and final recovery. Sample 29 is visually and attributionally (SHAP) nearly identical to those label-1 references.\\n- The label-3 reference (Sample 46) shares some similarity in the mid-rise but differs in where SHAP concentrates and in the relative prominence of the late trough\u2192recovery. The label-2 (minivan) references show deeper/more complex mid-structure across the front/mid segments; while they share the late trough property, their overall ordering and local substructures differ subtly.\\n- After cross-check, label 1 remains the best and most consistent match: both the time-series morphology and the SHAP localization align strongly with the pickup pattern described in the dataset notes.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1 (pickup) with a high-confidence similarity score of 4. Per-label similarity summary used in reasoning: label_0:2, label_1:4, label_2:3, label_3:3.\"\n    ]\n}",

Characteristics: fairly steep low\u2011frequency rise (local slope larger than surrounding slopes), a short rounded plateau with micro\u2011bumps on top. STFT again shows low\u2011frequency dominance here and SHAP marks this feature as supportive evidence.\",\n    \"  - Minor red at early times: faint low\u2011frequency positive pixels near the left portion (t \u2248 0\u201360).

Minivan would require the classifier to be attributing strongly to the trough itself (the deepest negative lobe) \u2014 while sample 29 does have a deep trough, the SHAP peak is centered on the recovery rather than the trough bottom, favoring pickup over minivan. The mid rise (\u2248260\u2013280) supports both pickup and SUV to some extent, but SUV\u2019s main positive is earlier (\u2248110\u2013220) and its strongest SHAP emphasis differs from the final recovery emphasis seen here.

Divergence risk: minivan summaries also mention a late deep trough, so a mistaken emphasis on the trough-bottom itself (rather than the rebound where SHAP concentrates) could produce a minivan assignment. I avoid that error by using the attribution map: SHAP peaks on the recovery not the trough-bottom, which matches the pickup prototypes in the reference summaries rather than minivan prototypes (which emphasize the trough itself) or SUV (which emphasizes an earlier mid shoulder).

This rise is smooth and low-volatility; STFT shows low-frequency energy there too.\",\n        \"  - Important negative/neutral area: the deep trough centered near t \u2248 400\u2013430 (amplitude \u2248 -1.7 to -1.85) shows little or slightly negative SHAP (pale blue in some nearby cells). That indicates the classifier does not treat the deep negative trough as a primary positive cue for the class favored by the positive patches \u2014 instead it is either neutral or slightly counter-indicative in this model\u2019s decision for the positive label regions.\",\n        \"Step 2 \u2014 Global / overall feature summary and relationships:\",\n        \"  - Global morphology: the series is dominated by very-low-frequency, long-wavelength structure with roughly two large cycles across 577 steps: initial high \u2192 descent to a moderate trough (t\u224880\u2013170) \u2192 strong low-frequency rise to a rounded mid peak (t\u2248250\u2013320) \u2192 steep descent to a deep trough (t\u2248380\u2013430) \u2192 smooth recovery and terminal rise to a final high (t\u2248480\u2013576).\",\n        \"  - Amplitude & slopes: extremes range from \u2248 +1.6 (peaks) down to \u2248 -1.8 (deep trough).

Volatility is low overall; micro-ripples appear mainly at extrema and on plateaus.\",\n        \"  - Frequency content: STFT is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins throughout; there is only weak energy in higher bins limited to tiny bursts at transitions. This confirms the classifier is relying on coarse outline/low-frequency envelope features rather than high-frequency texture.\",\n        \"  - Temporal dependence / combination: the positively-attributed segments (early rise through the mid-peak and the terminal recovery) appear as a coherent low-frequency envelope pattern (trough \u2192 slow rise \u2192 sustained peak \u2192 later trough \u2192 final rise). The model rewards the presence and timing of the slow upward transitions and sustained positive plateaus more than the existence of the deep trough alone (which is neutral or mildly negative in SHAP).\",\n        \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching to label summaries and short scoring:\",\n        \"  - Label 0 (sedan): The sedan description emphasizes dominant very-low-frequency lobes with: an early trough (~80\u2013140), a broad mid positive peak (~200\u2013300) with short plateau + micro-ripples, a deeper later trough, and a terminal positive rise. SHAP for label-0 reference samples concentrates on low-frequency positive attribution at the mid-rise/plateau and near the end. Sample 41 shows those exact elements: strong low-frequency positive attribution at t\u2248175\u2013215 (the upward transition), a rounded high plateau \u2248250\u2013320, and a confirming terminal rise. This is a close match.

Sample 41 shares many morphological elements with label 1 (deep trough + recovery), but the SHAP map for this sample places its strongest positive weight earlier (mid-rise/plateau) and gives the deep trough / immediate recovery a weaker or neutral contribution. That makes the match moderately strong but not as tight as for label 0.

In sample 41 the deep trough around t\u2248400\u2013430 is present but SHAP shows it as neutral/weak negative rather than strongly positive. Therefore the sample only weakly matches the minivan pattern.

By contrast, the label-1 reference (sample 43) shows stronger SHAP positive mass on the late rebound around t\u2248420\u2013480; sample 41 does not show that same late-SHAP emphasis.\",\n        \"  - Fairness and scoring logic: the score for the chosen label (label 0) was assigned as 4 because both the raw time-series geometry and the SHAP attribution align very closely with the sedan (label 0) pattern summaries and with multiple label-0 reference examples. Label 1 is scored 3 because of strong morphological similarity but slightly different attribution emphasis; labels 2 and 3 are substantially less consistent with the SHAP + waveform combination and so receive lower scores.\",\n        \"Final answer: label 0 (sedan) with top similarity score 4 because the sample\u2019s low-frequency mid-rise + rounded plateau and terminal recovery are the primary positively-attributed events in SHAP and match the sedan pattern exactly; the deep trough is present but is neutral/weak in SHAP and therefore not the primary driver (which aligns with the sedan description).\"\n    ]\n}",

Because the SHAP heatmap is essentially nonzero only at the lowest frequency, the model is attributing evidence in the very-low-frequency envelope rather than short, high-frequency details.\\n- Corresponding waveform features (t \u2248 170\u2013230): the raw trace is in a low-to-mid negative range at the start of that window (~-1.1 \u2026 -0.9, the left side of the rise), then exhibits a steady, low-volatility upward ramp that crosses zero and climbs to positive values. The rise rate in that window is fairly smooth: average slope about +0.02\u2013+0.035 units/step for the main rising limb. Volatility is low \u2014 only small, short micro\u2011ripples (amplitude << 0.1) appear superposed on the ramp. The STFT shows increased energy only in the bottom frequency bin during this interval, confirming the event is a slow, long-wavelength rise.\\n- Secondary red contribution (t \u2248 250\u2013320): maps to the rounded positive plateau/peak region centered near t \u2248 270\u2013300 where the signal reaches ~+1.4 to +1.6. This plateau is broad (tens of steps), has a small flattened shoulder and tiny high-frequency wiggles on top. SHAP positive attribution focused on the low-frequency band here implies the classifier rewards the presence of a stable, sustained positive plateau in the mid-series.\\n- Terminal / end region: the series climbs again after the large trough (later) to a final positive plateau (~+1.4 to +1.6). SHAP shows modest positive support at low frequency near the right edge (less intense than the midrise), matching the late sustained positive level seen in the trace.\\n- Notable negative/neutral SHAP area: the deep trough near t \u2248 400\u2013440 (signal minimum \u2248 -1.7 to -1.9) does not carry strong positive SHAP \u2014 it is not the dominant positive driver for the predicted class (the SHAP map is pale/neutral or slightly negative there). The STFT also shows strong low-frequency energy at the trough times, but the SHAP map indicates the model does not use that trough as the primary positive evidence in this sample.\\n- Short summary of local metrics: mid-sequence upward ramp (t\u2248170\u2013230) \u0394 \u2248 +1.9 units over \u224850\u201360 steps, low volatility (micro\u2011ripples < ~0.05), plateau at +1.4\u20131.6 (t\u2248250\u2013320) with small top-side wiggles; deep trough later (~t\u2248410\u2013430, \u2248 -1.8) with smooth descent/ascent but limited positive SHAP attribution.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall feature analysis and temporal dependence:\\n- Global envelope and periodicity: the series is dominated by very low-frequency oscillation with roughly two large half-cycles across the 577 steps: (1) early high \u2192 broad descent to a first trough near t\u2248120 (\u2248 -1.1), (2) long, pronounced rise to a mid/high plateau at t\u2248260\u2013300 (~+1.5), (3) steep descent to the global trough at t\u2248410\u2013430 (\u2248 -1.7 to -1.9), (4) steady recovery and final positive plateau at the end. This long-wavelength oscillatory envelope is the dominant structure (STFT energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin throughout).\\n- Volatility: generally low. The curve is smooth except for very small high-frequency ripples (amplitude << main wave) concentrated near extrema (peaks/trough bottoms); these appear as faint energy above the DC band in the STFT but are not emphasized by SHAP.\\n- Slopes and asymmetry: rises and falls are asymmetric \u2014 the midrise (t\u2248170\u2013300) shows a steady-to-steep low-frequency ascent, while the fall into the global trough is relatively steeper in magnitude. The classifier\u2019s SHAP attribution favors the upward, sustained low-frequency structures (especially the midrise and plateau) more than the deep negative excursion.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: the discriminative evidence is not a single instantaneous point but a time-extended pattern: trough \u2192 steady rise \u2192 rounded, sustained positive plateau (mid-series), and a final sustained positive plateau near the end. The SHAP red windows are temporally coherent and align with the low-frequency envelope events described above.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and preliminary label selection (qualitative matching):\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary key points: strong positive attribution on low-frequency, smooth upward transitions around t\u2248150\u2013210 and a rounded sustained positive plateau around t\u2248200\u2013300; model relies mainly on very-low-frequency envelope and favors the trough\u2192slow rise\u2192sustained positive plateau motif; final positive plateau reinforces classification. Comparison: sample 41 shows a very close match \u2014 strongest SHAP exactly at the low-frequency midrise (\u2248170\u2013230), a broad rounded plateau near 250\u2013300, and a confirming final plateau. The microstructure (small ripples on the plateau/trough) and concentrated STFT bottom-band energy also match the sedan description. => High similarity.\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary key points: also emphasizes low-frequency trough\u2192rise events (mid trough ~150\u2013220 followed by steep rise) and a long recovery near the end; model often gives strong positive SHAP to both midrise and final recovery. Comparison: sample 41 shares the midrise and final recovery, so there is moderate-to-strong similarity to pickup as well. The distinction in the pickup descriptions is that the final recovery (post-global trough) often carries stronger positive attribution in pickup examples; in sample 41 that late trough\u2192recovery region is less positively attributed than the midrise. => Moderate similarity.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary key points: classifier gives strongest positive attribution to the deep rear trough around t\u2248420\u2013480 (that trough is the primary positive cue). Comparison: sample 41 does have a deep trough at \u2248420\u2013430, but SHAP does not show this trough as the main positive driver (it is neutral or slightly negative there). So although there is a morphological trough, the model\u2019s attribution pattern in this sample does not match the minivan profile. => Low similarity.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary key points: prominent mid-section long upward ramp/shoulder around t\u2248110\u2013220 and positive attribution concentrated there; large trough later may be neutral. Comparison: sample 41 has an almost identical midrise/shoulder, so there is some similarity to SUV as well. However the sedan description specifically emphasizes both the midrise and the later final plateau in combination and the SHAP pattern alignments in the sedan summary are a closer fit overall. => Low-to-moderate similarity.\\n\\nPreliminary label pick (highest match): label 0 (sedan).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference examples and final verification:\\n- Reference comparison: the provided \\\"similar\\\" examples include several samples very close in waveform to sample 41. Among those, multiple reference plots labeled 0 (samples shown as label 0 in the provided set) exhibit the same trough\u2192rise\u2192rounded mid-peak\u2192deep trough\u2192final rise structure and have SHAP patterns that emphasize the midrise/plateau and end features in the low-frequency band. One \\\"similar\\\" example labeled 1 had a very similar waveform too, showing that raw waveform shape alone can occur in multiple classes, but the decisive element is where the model puts positive SHAP mass. In sample 41 the SHAP mass is concentrated at the midrise/plateau and end \u2014 the pattern described in the sedan summary \u2014 while minivan/pickup references put more importance on the deep trough or on the late recovery respectively. The provided dissimilar (label 3) references emphasize midrise but in their SHAP maps the attribution patterns differ in timing and/or strength from the present sample.\\n- Fairness & scoring logic: I weighted the match primarily by (1) where SHAP assigns positive evidence (time + frequency), (2) the morphological envelope (amplitude/time/shape: trough\u2192rise\u2192plateau), and (3) the presence/absence of supporting microstructure (small ripples at extrema). Because sample 41's strongest SHAP aligns with the low-frequency midrise/plateau and with a confirming final plateau rather than the deep trough, the sedan label summary is the closest match by content and by where the model actually placed importance. The pickup label is the next-closest match because of shared trough\u2192rise features, but in pickup examples the late recovery often carries stronger SHAP \u2014 which is not the case here. Minivan is less likely because its summary places the greatest positive weight on the deep trough region, which is not strongly positive here. SUV shares the midrise element but overall the combined midrise+rounded plateau+terminal plateau+SHAP pattern match sedan more closely.\\n\\nFinal quantitative similarity scores (1\u20134) against each label (after careful re-check):\\n- label 0 (sedan): 4 (high similarity \u2014 both the midrise + rounded plateau and end plateau, and SHAP localization to the lowest frequency row at t\u2248170\u2013320 and near the end, match the sedan pattern closely).\\n- label 1 (pickup): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 shares trough\u2192steep midrise and final recovery morphology, but sample SHAP emphasizes the midrise/plateau more than the late recovery, making pickup a slightly weaker fit than sedan).\\n- label 2 (minivan): 2 (low similarity \u2014 the deep trough is present morphologically but SHAP does not place the main positive mass on that trough in this sample, so it is not a close match to the minivan attribution pattern).\\n- label 3 (SUV): 2 (low-to-moderate similarity \u2014 shares the broad midrise/shoulder shape but lacks other SUV-specific SHAP/temporal nuances that would raise confidence to a higher score).\\n\\nConclusion: taking the SHAP-localized evidence (very-low-frequency positive attribution centered on the midrise at t\u2248170\u2013230 and the broad plateau at t\u2248250\u2013320, plus supporting final plateau) together with the waveform envelope and reference-sample checks, the most consistent label is label 0 (sedan).

Corresponding trace behavior: after the mid-peak the signal falls to a deep trough centered \u2248410\u2013430 (\u2248 -1.6 to -1.7) then undergoes a long, smooth recovery to a terminal positive plateau (\u2248 +1.4\u2013+1.6). The late recovery is low-volatility and dominated by very low-frequency content in the STFT. The SHAP red there is modest compared with the midrise but still positive \u2014 indicating the model rewards both the mid trough\u2192rise and final trough\u2192recovery shape.\",\n    \"  - Negligible high-frequency attribution: SHAP is focused almost exclusively on the bottom frequency band; STFT shows almost all signal energy at very low frequencies across the sequence and only faint higher-frequency bursts localized at extrema.

Sample 43 shows the strongest SHAP at t\u2248180\u2013220 (exactly where pickup examples put positive weight), a pronounced mid trough\u2192rise, and a later wide recovery from the global trough back to a high plateau. The reference similar sample 52 (label 1) is visually and spectrally nearly identical (matching timing of midrise, deep trough and terminal recovery), confirming a high similarity. Therefore label 1 is the best match.\",\n    \"  - Label 0 (sedan) match (score = 3/4): Sedan summaries stress dominant low-frequency lobes with two cycles, positive plateaus around t\u2248200\u2013300, and positive attribution at sustained positive plateaus. Sample 43 does have a rounded positive mid-plateau and terminal plateau like sedans. However, the SHAP emphasis in this sample is concentrated on the trough\u2192rise mid-segment and on a late recovery pattern characteristic of pickups; sedans in the reference set put heavier consistent positive weight across multiple low-frequency positive lobes rather than the pronounced trough\u2192rebound signature that the sample exhibits. Thus moderate but not best match.\",\n    \"  - Label 2 (minivan) match (score = 2/4): Minivan descriptions emphasize a very deep broad trough around t\u2248420\u2013470 as the key discriminative element and very strong low-frequency energy there. Sample 43 does have a deep trough in that region, and there is some SHAP positivity in late trough\u2192recovery, but the strongest SHAP in our sample sits earlier (t\u2248180\u2013220) rather than making the late trough the single most positive cue. Also minivan summaries often assign the deepest SHAP weight to the late trough itself; in sample 43 that late trough is not the dominant red area. So only low/moderate similarity.\",\n    \"  - Label 3 (SUV) match (score = 2/4): SUV summaries highlight a large, smooth mid-section rise (valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded shoulder) as the primary positive cue. Sample 43 does have a long mid rise and rounded peak that superficially resembles SUV patterns, but SUV SHAP emphasis in reference examples is often more focused on the long mid-shoulder as the principal discriminant and sometimes treats deep post-peak troughs as neutral or negative. In our sample the classifier\u2019s strongest positive attribution is the trough\u2192rise event centered ~180\u2013220, which better matches pickup data. Therefore SUV is a plausible but weaker match.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference examples and final decision:\",\n    \"  - Similar reference check: Sample 52 (label 1) is the closest visual and SHAP match \u2014 same mid trough\u2192steep rise to a rounded peak and a later deep trough followed by recovery; its SHAP heatmap also shows the strong low-frequency red at \u2248200, matching our test sample. Samples 50 and 16 (label 0) are visually close in the global envelope but their SHAP maps show somewhat more distributed positive attribution across multiple positive lobes; they match less exactly on where the strongest attribution falls. Sample 7 (label 3) shares the broad mid-shoulder characteristic but its SHAP emphasis differs in timing and intensity. Dissimilar examples (51, 59) show larger differences in either timing/intensity of red SHAP patches or different mid/late patterning and so do not match as well.\",\n    \"  - Fairness & scoring logic: I scored the final label (label 1) as 4 because (a) the strongest SHAP red region in this sample is precisely in the mid trough\u2192rise time window that the label-1 summary and training reference (sample 52) treat as the primary discriminative cue, (b) the late deep trough + sustained recovery is present (another label-1 hallmark), and (c) STFT confirms the low-frequency envelope emphasis that the pickup class models use. I assigned lower scores to other labels because while they share some envelope features (rounded peaks, deep troughs), the timing and SHAP emphasis differ in ways that reduce the match confidence.\",\n    \"Final classification: label 1 (pickup) with high similarity/confidence (score = 4).\"\n  ]\n}",

I map those red cells to the time series and describe the local features precisely:\\n  \u2022 Time range: ~150\u2013220 (primary); secondary positive support ~420\u2013576 (weaker).\\n  \u2022 Amplitude: in the primary window the trace moves from roughly -1.2 (near trough) up through zero to \u2248 +0.5\u2013+1.0 and then continues to a stronger peak later. The local midrise centered ~200\u2013220 reaches amplitudes around +1.0\u2013+1.5 in the subsequent plateau region. The late window climbs from the global trough (~-1.7 at \u2248420) back to +1.4\u2013+1.6 by the end.\\n  \u2022 Trend & change rate: the primary red interval corresponds to a sustained, relatively steep positive ramp (a low-frequency ascent) \u2014 average slope in the mid-rise is noticeably larger (steeper) than the earlier descent. The late red region corresponds to a prolonged, steady recovery (moderate positive slope) from the deep trough to the end.\\n  \u2022 Volatility and substructure: both red windows are dominated by smooth, low-volatility behavior (low short-term jitter). Small micro-bumps (short low-amplitude ripples) appear on top of the ramps/plateaus but are minor; STFT confirms energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins in these windows (very little mid/high-frequency energy). SHAP red aligns with those low-frequency bins, indicating the model attributes the slow ramp + plateau and the long recovery as positive evidence.\\n  \u2022 Shape: the primary positive feature is a trough\u2192sharp-ish ascent\u2192rounded plateau half-cycle (a deep negative valley followed by a strong positive rebound). The late positive region is a long trough-to-plateau recovery (broad low-frequency half-cycle).\\n  \u2022 Conclusion from local features: the classifier is rewarding two main low-frequency half-cycle events \u2014 the mid-sequence trough\u2192fast/steep rebound (t\u2248150\u2013220) and the global trough\u2192long recovery to the end (t\u2248420\u2013576). These are prototypical low-frequency, large-amplitude recovery events rather than brief spikes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall series description and dependencies:\\n- Overall waveform: the series is dominated by long-wavelength (very low frequency) oscillation spanning the 577 steps. Visible structure: an early high (~+1.5) \u2192 smooth descent to a first trough near t\u2248100 (\u2248 -1.0 to -1.25) \u2192 a pronounced rebound and broad peak centered \u2248260\u2013300 (+1.3 to +1.6) \u2192 a deep, sharp-ish trough centered \u2248420 (\u2248 -1.6 to -1.8) \u2192 a steady, sustained recovery to the end (~+1.5).\\n- Periodicity & frequency content: STFT shows nearly all energy in the lowest frequency bin(s); there is essentially no sustained mid/high-frequency content. This confirms the dominant role of slow envelope morphology (broad peaks/troughs) for discrimination.\\n- Volatility: low overall; the main inflection zones have slightly elevated micro-ripples, but these are small amplitude and do not dominate energy. The series shows asymmetric slopes: the mid-sequence ascent is relatively steep, whereas some descents (especially into the global trough) are longer/steeper at different times \u2014 producing an asymmetric oscillatory cycle.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: the discriminative evidence is cumulative: an early trough \u2192 a strong mid-rise/plateau \u2192 descent into a deep later trough \u2192 a long recovery to a positive plateau. The mid trough\u2192rebound pair and the final trough\u2192recovery pair occur in sequence and together form the signature the model uses.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists and selection of best label:\\n- Compare to labels' summaries:\\n  \u2022 Label 1 (pickup): its summary emphasizes strong positive SHAP at a trough-to-recovery window near t\u2248150\u2013220, a steep low-frequency ascent to a mid-peak, and also positive attribution for the long recovery from the global trough back to a late positive plateau (t\u2248420\u2013576). The description explicitly matches: deep trough(s), a pronounced mid-rise (steep ascent) and a later broad recovery \u2014 all low-frequency.\\n  \u2022 Label 0 (sedan): emphasises broad low-frequency lobes, positive plateaus around t\u2248200\u2013300 and t\u2248500\u2013576 and small ripples at extrema. While some of those sedan features (broad low-frequency plateaus) are present, sedan summaries indicate the model favors positive plateaus more than very steep trough\u2192rebound asymmetries and they also noted some deep troughs may be neutral or slightly negative for sedan.\\n  \u2022 Label 2 (minivan): highlights a very deep mid/late trough as the strongest positive cue (late trough ~420\u2013470) and a distinct early hump and several alternating crests/troughs. While sample 43 does have a late deep trough, the SHAP emphasis here is stronger around the mid trough\u2192rebound (t\u2248150\u2013220) than exclusively on the late trough; label 2 descriptions center more on the late trough as the main driver.\\n  \u2022 Label 3 (SUV): emphasizes a long, smooth, high-amplitude rise in the mid-section (t\u2248110\u2013220) with strong SHAP on the broad rise/shoulder. Some overlap exists (mid rise is present) but SUV summaries also often report a rounded shoulder + specific peak morphology and mixed attribution around the deep trough. In our sample the strongest positive attribution is on the trough\u2192rebound at \u2248150\u2013220 plus the late recovery \u2014 the temporal pattern and SHAP localization correspond more closely to the pickup description.\\n- Best match: label 1 (pickup). The primary reasons:\\n  1) SHAP red is strongest right where pickup summaries put their diagnostic trough\u2192ascent (\u2248150\u2013220).\\n  2) The sample also shows the long recovery from the global trough to a positive plateau (\u2248420\u2013576), which pickup summaries treat as a confirming positive cue.\\n  3) A highly similar reference example (Sample 52, Label 1) has nearly identical waveform, STFT energy concentration and very similar SHAP localization at ~200 \u2014 that reinforces the pickup assignment.\\n- Therefore I select label 1 and rate the similarity as high.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against reference samples and final verification:\\n- Reference similarity check:\\n  \u2022 Sample 52 (Label 1, provided as similar): visually almost a one-to-one match \u2014 same early high \u2192 descent \u2192 mid steep ascent/plateau \u2192 deep late trough \u2192 final recovery. Its SHAP heatmap also shows a concentrated red patch in the same low-frequency row near ~200. This is strong empirical confirmation.\\n  \u2022 Samples labeled 0 and 3 in the similar set also share low-frequency lobes but their SHAP emphasis and the timing of their strongest positive patches differ slightly (they either weight the plateaus or mid shoulder differently). Our sample's SHAP emphasis and time alignment match the pickup prototypes more closely than sedan or SUV prototypes.\\n  \u2022 Dissimilar examples (other labels) show different SHAP distributions or different timing of strong low-frequency events; they reinforce that the crucial discriminative moments for pickup are the mid trough\u2192rebound and the late recovery, which our sample exhibits prominently.\\n- Scoring fairness and consistency: given the near-complete alignment of waveform shape, timing of key extrema, STFT low-frequency dominance, and SHAP localization with the pickup feature summary and with a near-identical labeled training example (sample 52), a high similarity score is justified. Differences vs. other labels are minor (all classes share low-frequency waves) but the temporal pattern and SHAP attribution are distinctive for label 1.\\n\\nFinal decision summary:\\n- Predicted label: label 1 (pickup).\\n- Similarity score for this label: 4 (high similarity). The sample matches the pickup pattern (mid trough\u2192steep ascent, and long recovery after the late trough) both in waveform and SHAP attribution, and closely matches a labeled training example.\\n\\n(If a multi-label or per-label score were required I would give: label0=3 (some low-frequency plateau matches), label1=4, label2=3 (shares deep late trough but SHAP emphasis differs), label3=2\u20133 (shares mid-rise but SHAP/timing less consistent).

Quantitative/qualitative description: trough minimum \u2248 -1.6 to -1.7 around t\u2248410\u2013425; the subsequent recovery climbs from \u2248 -1.6 up to \u2248 +1.5 by the end (t=576). The recovery spans \u2248 150 time steps (\u2248420\u2192576) with an average slope \u2248 +0.02 units/step; the ramp is smooth, low volatility and dominated by very-low-frequency content in the STFT (energy concentrated near the bottom rows). The ramp contains a small plateau/dip around t\u2248500\u2013525 (a short-lived substructure of ~20\u201330 steps) visible as a small kink on the rising flank.\\n- Secondary positively-attributed segments: there are smaller red patches at low frequency around the mid-sequence rise (\u2248 t=240\u2013300) and modest red at an earlier interval (~t\u224850\u201390). In the time trace those correspond to: (a) a strong mid-sequence ascent from near 0 to a rounded peak \u2248 +1.4\u2013+1.6 centered \u2248260\u2013280 (steepest midrise; slope ~+0.03\u2013+0.04 units/step) with a short plateau and tiny high-frequency jitters at the crest; (b) an early descent into a shallow trough \u2248 -1.0 to -1.2 around t\u2248100\u2013160 (smooth, low volatility). The STFT shows these features are also low-frequency dominated (bottom-frequency band has highest magnitude during these intervals). The SHAP heatmap assigns positive weight to the long recovery and to the midrise; the deep trough itself shows neutral to mixed SHAP (pale/weak blue at trough bottom), indicating the model emphasizes the trough\u2192recovery transition more than the trough alone.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series structure and temporal dependence:\\n- Global shape: A long-period, low-frequency oscillatory envelope with roughly two long half-cycles across 577 steps: initial high \u2192 fall to a first trough (~t\u2248100\u2013160), steep mid-rise to a high plateau (~t\u2248240\u2013300), long descent to the global trough (~t\u2248400\u2013425), then a smooth, extended recovery to a high terminal plateau (~t\u2248520\u2013576). Amplitudes: maxima \u2248 +1.5\u2013+1.7, minima \u2248 -1.6 to -1.7. Volatility is low overall; micro-ripples are confined to peaks/trough flanks.\\n- Key temporal dependence: classifier-relevant ordering is trough \u2192 rapid/large mid-rise \u2192 descent to deep trough \u2192 long smooth recovery to terminal high. The SHAP map concentrates positive evidence at low frequencies during the midrise and (especially) the late recovery, indicating the model uses the amplitude, slope and timing of those slow envelope events as the decisive signature. STFT corroborates: almost all spectral energy sits in the lowest frequency bins during these intervals; higher frequencies are negligible.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label summaries and coarse label scoring:\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary key points: strong positive SHAP on trough\u2192recovery near ~418\u2013475, strong mid-sequence steep ascent ~200\u2013280, low-frequency dominance, and model sensitivity to long, sustained recovery after deep trough. Match: The sample displays the same distinctive features: deep trough at \u2248420 followed by a long, smooth recovery to a high terminal plateau (SHAP red concentrated on that recovery) and a pronounced midrise at ~240\u2013280. This is a very close match. Similarity score: 4 (high similarity).\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary: emphasis on sustained positive plateaus and several low-frequency lobes with positive SHAP at those plateaus. Match: Sample has positive plateaus (mid and terminal) and low-frequency lobes, but sedan summaries emphasize positive plateaus more than the deep trough\u2192recovery signature. Sample shares some envelope traits but the late recovery being the main positive cue aligns more with pickup than sedan. Similarity score: 3 (moderate similarity).\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary: large, very-low-frequency deep trough around t\u2248420 with strongest positive SHAP at that trough itself, plus a strong final rise. Match: The sample does have a deep trough near ~420 and a final rise, but SHAP in the sample is concentrated on the recovery (not the trough center). Minivan examples place strongest positive attribution on the trough magnitude itself; here the model instead rewards the rebound and midrise. Similarity score: 2 (low similarity).\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary: strong positively-attributed long low-frequency rise centered earlier (\u2248110\u2013220), rounded peak/shoulder around ~180\u2013220, then later deep troughs that may be neutral or negative. Match: Our sample has a midrise, but it is centered later (\u2248240\u2013280) and the SHAP emphasis is heavier at the late recovery than at an early long rise. Also SUV summaries often highlight the earlier long rising shoulder as the strongest positive cue, which is not the case here. Similarity score: 2 (low similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- The provided similar reference images for Label 1 (Samples 31, 15, 56) are visually and structurally very close to this test sample: they show the same initial fall, pronounced midrise (\u2248250\u2013280), a deep trough near \u2248400\u2013430 and a long recovery to the end. Their SHAP maps also place positive weight on midrise and end recovery. This confirms the high correspondence and supports classifying the test sample as label 1.\\n- Sample 46 (label 3) is visually close in raw shape but its SHAP emphasis is different (earlier shoulder region), so while shapes overlap across classes, the attribution patterns separate label 1 vs 3. Dissimilar samples labeled 2 (55 and 48) show different local microstructure and different SHAP distributions (more emphasis directly on trough center or different timing), reinforcing that our sample is less like label 2.\\n- Fairness & scoring check: I assigned label 1 a maximum similarity (4) because both the raw waveform and the SHAP attribution pattern (positive emphasis on the trough\u2192recovery and midrise) match the label 1 description almost exactly. Label 0 receives a 3 because of shared low-frequency lobes and positive plateaus but lacks the same attribution pattern. Labels 2 and 3 get 2 because while individual elements exist (a deep trough for label 2; a midrise for label 3), the combination, timing and SHAP emphasis best match label 1.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1 (pickup). Overall confidence score for predicted label (matching strength) = 4.\\n\\nPer-label similarity summary used to double-check reasoning (1..4 scale):\\n- label 0 : 3\\n- label 1 : 4 (predicted)\\n- label 2 : 2\\n- label 3 : 2\\n\\nAll observations use the time plot, STFT (very-low-frequency dominance) and the SHAP heatmap (red concentration on late recovery and midrise) jointly to reach the result.\"\n  ]\n}"

There are only weak/mixed SHAP pixels elsewhere.\\n- Map those windows to the time series plot and describe exact local features:\\n  * Window A (\u2248 180\u2013220): The series is in a sustained upward swing here \u2014 amplitude rises from slightly negative values near 0 up through ~+0.6 and continues toward the mid peak. The change is smooth (low volatility), average slope modest but steady (low-frequency ramp), and there are only tiny high-frequency ripples (small jaggedness of a few hundredths). STFT shows enhanced energy at the very-low-frequency bin during this window, confirming the event is long-wavelength rather than a short spike.\\n  * Window B (\u2248 240\u2013320): This corresponds to the broad positive peak/plateau centered ~260\u2013300 where the signal attains its mid-sequence maximum near +1.4\u2013+1.6. The plateau is rounded (not a needle spike), has a short flattened top with small superimposed micro-bumps, low short\u2011term volatility, and the local STFT again concentrates power in the lowest frequency bin. SHAP red there indicates this rounded, sustained positive lobe strongly drives positive class evidence.\\n  * Window C (\u2248 500\u2013576): The late segment shows a smooth, sustained final rise from negative/near-zero up to a terminal plateau around +1.45\u2013+1.6. The rise is steady with low volatility and small localized bumps near the end. STFT again shows power at the bottom frequency. SHAP red here provides confirming evidence (a terminal positive lobe) for the class decision.\\n- Negative troughs (context, not SHAP-positive): There are two main troughs visible: an earlier trough around t \u2248 80\u2013140 (min \u2248 \u22121.05 to \u22121.25) that is broad and smooth with minor micro\u2011ripples, and a later deeper trough centered \u2248 400\u2013440 (min \u2248 \u22121.5 to \u22121.7). These deep negative excursions show low-frequency energy in the STFT but the SHAP heatmap gives neutral/weak attribution there (pale or mixed), i.e. the model does not treat these extrema as the main positive cues for the predicted class.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series summary and combination/time-dependence of features:\\n- Global form: The series is dominated by very-low-frequency envelope structure (STFT energy concentrated in the lowest bins). The overall waveform contains roughly two long-period oscillatory lobes across 577 steps: an initial high\u2192broad trough\u2192large positive mid-peak cycle, followed by a deeper trough and a final strong recovery to a positive terminal plateau. Volatility is low overall; micro-scale high-frequency ripples appear only at extrema and inflection points.\\n- Timing & asymmetry: The sequence of events is (1) early descent from ~+1.6 into a smooth trough around t\u2248100, (2) a steady low-frequency rise and rounded high plateau at t\u2248260\u2013300 (mid-peak), (3) a steep descent into the deepest trough near t\u2248410\u2013430, and (4) a sustained monotonic rise to a late plateau by the end. Slopes are asymmetric: some descents are steeper than rises (and vice versa) depending on segment, but the classifier\u2019s positive attribution is concentrated on the slow rises and sustained positive plateaus rather than on sharp descents.\\n- How features combine: The model rewards the pattern trough \u2192 slow-rise \u2192 sustained mid-plateau (around t\u2248180\u2013320) and then the late rise/terminal plateau (t\u2248500\u2013576). The ordered presence and durations of these low-frequency lobes form the composite signature used by the classifier \u2014 micro-ripples are incidental and have little SHAP weight.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to class feature summaries and label selection:\\n- Compare to label_0 (sedan) summary: Label_0 descriptions emphasize (a) dominant low-frequency oscillation with a broad trough ~80\u2013140, (b) a strong rounded positive lobe/plateau around t\u2248200\u2013300 with small top-of-crest wiggles, (c) a deep trough later but with SHAP neutral/negative weight, and (d) a final sustained positive rise to the end. The sample's key positively-attributed windows (\u2248180\u2013320 and \u2248500\u2013576), their shapes (rounded plateau, low volatility, small micro-bumps), the STFT low-frequency energy, and the temporal ordering match label_0 very closely.\\n- Compare to label_1 (pickup): Label_1 also describes low-frequency trough\u2192rapid rebound events and strong positive SHAP around trough-to-recovery segments (especially a pronounced recovery near the end). Sample 45 does have a late recovery and mid trough-to-peak transition, so there is moderate similarity. However label_1 accounts put especially strong weight on rapid rebound magnitude and timing (e.g., a powerful recovery at t\u2248418\u2013475). In our sample the SHAP emphasis is stronger on the mid positive plateau and on the late terminal plateau rather than a single dominating rapid rebound event, aligning better with label_0.\\n- Compare to label_2 (minivan) and label_3 (SUV): Both label_2 and label_3 emphasize specific trough/peak morphologies that differ in timing/relative amplitudes from Sample 45 (label_2 favors very deep rear trough as primary positive cue; label_3 highlights a strong mid rise/shoulder but with a different pattern of subsequent extremes). Sample 45\u2019s attribution pattern and plateau-focus are less consistent with those labels than with label_0.\\n- Conclusion for label selection: The highest match is label_0 (sedan). The sample reproduces the defining low-frequency rounded mid-peak and terminal positive plateau that label_0\u2019s explanations and the provided similar reference samples emphasize.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples and final confidence scoring:\\n- Similar references: Samples 36, 50 and 0 (all labeled 0) display nearly the same envelope: early descent to a moderate trough (~t\u224880\u2013140), a strong rounded mid positive lobe centered ~260\u2013300, deeper later trough near ~410\u2013430, and a final strong rise to the end. Their SHAP maps likewise concentrate positive attribution in the lowest-frequency band around the mid-lobe and toward the end. Sample 45 matches these both visually and in attribution, reinforcing the classification.\\n- Dissimilar references: The dissimilar label_3 and label_1 examples have different SHAP distributions or emphasize other windows; while there is some overlap (all samples share low-frequency lobes), the position and SHAP-weighted importance of the mid-plateau + terminal plateau in sample 45 align strongest with label_0.\\n- Score justification: Given near-complete correspondence between (i) the sample\u2019s positively attributed time windows (location and low-frequency nature), (ii) the waveform morphology (rounded mid-peak + terminal plateau + low volatility + small micro-ripples), and (iii) multiple label_0 reference examples, I assign a high similarity (score = 4) to label_0. There is moderate similarity to label_1 (shared trough\u2192rise behavior), but the SHAP emphasis and plateau shapes match label_0 more closely.\\n\\nFinal answer: predicted class = label 0 (sedan) with similarity score 4.\"\n  ]\n}",

Duration \u2248 50\u2013120 steps (the main inflection appears from \u2248180 to \u2248280). Volatility is low on the ramp (small, short, high-frequency ripples of order 0.02\u20130.06 superimposed), the change-rate is moderate to steep for a low-frequency component (average slope in the main rising window \u2248 +0.02\u2013+0.035 units/step). Shape: broad low-frequency rising limb with a short plateau/shoulder near the top (small bumps visible at the crest). STFT confirms energy concentrated at the bottom frequency bin during this interval (strong low-frequency power).

Details: amplitude rises from about -1.6 (global trough near t\u2248410\u2013430) to ~+1.5 by the series end; this final climb is smooth, steady and low-volatility (slope roughly +0.02\u2013+0.03 per step over the later segment).

The early descent to the first trough (\u224880\u2013130) is smooth and moderately deep (~-1.0 to -1.2) but has mixed/weak SHAP, i.e., it provides context but less decisive evidence. The deep trough itself near t\u2248410\u2013430 shows little strong positive SHAP in this sample (the trough is present but SHAP is not concentrated exactly at its minimum), consistent with the classifier favouring the rising/plateau features more in this instance.\",\n        \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall time-series summary and dependence:\",\n        \" - Global envelope: The series is dominated by very low-frequency structure (two long half-cycles across 577 points).

This ordering (trough \u2192 steady sharp-ish rise \u2192 rounded mid-peak \u2192 deeper trough \u2192 final recovery) shows clear time dependence: the mid-rise and the final recovery are temporally separated but consistent envelope elements.\",\n        \" - Volatility: Low overall. Micro-oscillations (amplitude ~0.02\u20130.1) appear at peaks/trough bottoms and on the plateau, but they are minor. Most discriminative information is in the slow envelope (low-frequency).\",\n        \" - How features combine: The classifier appears to weight the mid-sequence trough\u2192rise\u2192plateau heavily (strong SHAP at low freq near t\u2248200) and also rewards the final long recovery/terminal plateau. The deep trough mid-late (\u2248410\u2013430) is present but not the strongest positive SHAP region for this sample (so it is contextually important but not the single dominant cue here).\",\n        \"Step 3 \u2014 Match against label feature lists and selection of most likely label:\",\n        \" - Label 0 (sedan) key descriptors: dominant very-low-frequency broad lobes; pronounced early trough \u224880\u2013140, broad positive peak \u2248200\u2013300 with short plateau and micro-ripples, deep trough \u2248340\u2013440, final positive plateau \u2248500\u2013576; model attribution concentrated on low-frequency sustained rises/plateaus (especially the mid positive lobe and the late plateau).\",\n        \"   * Match with sample 45: Almost exact.

The minivan pattern stresses the trough itself as the primary discriminative feature; here the trough is present but not the most strongly-attributed feature.\",\n        \" - Label 3 (SUV) key descriptors: strongest positive evidence is the long, high-amplitude upward ramp/shoulder in the mid-section \u2248110\u2013220 culminating in a rounded plateau/shoulder; SHAP for SUVs concentrates on that valley\u2192broad rise motif. \",\n        \"   * Match with sample 45: Some similarity \u2014 sample 45 does have a long rising shoulder around \u2248180\u2013220 and a rounded peak; however, the sedan pattern shares the same midrise but also requires the specific sequence of trough\u2192rise\u2192later deep trough\u2192final plateau which matches sample 45 better overall. SUVs in the reference descriptions often exhibit different subsequent structure (and the SHAP emphasis for SUVs in reference samples is uniquely centered on that mid-shoulder more exclusively).\",\n        \"Conclusion of Step 3: The highest matching label is label 0 (sedan). The midrise/plateau plus the final positive plateau and the two long low-frequency cycles match the sedan description very closely.

Those reference SHAP maps also show low-frequency positive attribution at the mid-plateau and end segments \u2014 the same pattern we see for sample 45. This reinforces a strong match to label 0.\",\n        \" - The similar sample labeled 1 (sample 31) is also similar in raw shape (since pickup and sedan share low-frequency cycles), but its SHAP emphasis and the textual summary for pickups put more weight on the trough\u2192rapid rebound (especially the rebound from the global trough around 418\u2013475). In sample 45 the rebound is present and has positive SHAP but is weaker than the midrise attribution \u2014 so pickup is plausible but secondary.\",\n        \" - Dissimilar references (labels 3 and 1 in the dissimilar set) show feature differences (e.g., more pronounced early/late spikes, different SHAP concentration).

I therefore inspected the time-series plot in that interval and the STFT low-frequency band for corroboration.\\n- Detailed description of the 150\u2013220 window (SHAP-red): amplitude, shape and substructure:\\n  - Amplitude & trend: the trace at ~150 is near the negative trough region (~-1.1 to -1.2). From ~150 to ~220 the series undergoes a clear, sustained low-frequency upward ramp rising from about -1.2 up through zero and reaching roughly +0.8\u2013+1.3 by ~220. The local maximum / plateau for that half-cycle sits slightly after this interval (around 260\u2013300), but the SHAP-red specifically highlights the rising inflection and early ascent portion.\\n  - Rate of change: the slope during the highlighted ascent is noticeably positive and relatively steep compared with the slower prior descent \u2014 average rise on the order of a few hundredths per step (consistent with a major low-frequency half-cycle). It is not an instantaneous spike but a long ramp over dozens of steps.\\n  - Volatility & substructure: volatility is low overall in this window \u2014 the rise is smooth with only small high-frequency ripples (tiny local bumps) visible on the rising flank and near the top. STFT confirms energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency bin there, with only faint higher-frequency content corresponding to micro-wiggles.\\n  - Shape: a broad negative-to-positive half-wave (trough \u2192 upward ramp) with modest shoulder/flattening as it approaches the mid-to-late rise. This exact trough\u2192rise morphology is what SHAP marks as positively contributing.\\n- Other locally relevant events (not strongly red but present in the series):\\n  - Early segment t\u22480\u2013120: a monotonic descent from ~+1.6 to ~-1.0 with low volatility (contextual baseline). STFT shows low-frequency energy.\\n  - Mid/late peak t\u2248260\u2013310: a broad positive crest near +1.5 (low-frequency) following the SHAP-highlighted rise. It is smooth and slightly plateaued with micro-bumps.\\n  - Deep trough t\u2248400\u2013440: there is a strong negative trough near -1.5 to -1.7 followed by a sustained recovery to +1.6 by the end (t=576). STFT concentration is again at the lowest frequencies. The SHAP map shows little red at the trough itself for this sample (i.e., the model did not attribute as strongly to that trough in this example).\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Global shape & periodicity: Sample 54 is dominated by very low-frequency structure (STFT concentrated near 0 frequency) forming roughly two long half-cycles across the 577 steps: (1) initial high \u2192 long descent \u2192 first trough (~t\u2248150\u2013200) \u2192 large rise and mid peak (~t\u2248260\u2013300), and (2) descent into a deep trough (~t\u2248400\u2013440) \u2192 long final recovery to a high positive plateau at the end. This is a slowly varying oscillatory envelope with low volatility except for small micro-ripples at extrema.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: the classifier (via SHAP) favors the trough\u2192rise events and the rising/plateau segments in the midseries (the early-to-mid trough and the broad ascent to the mid peak). In Sample 54 the most positive attribution aligns with the early-to-mid trough\u2192rise (t\u2248150\u2013220). The deep late trough and final recovery are present in the signal but were not the strongest positive contributors in the SHAP map for this sample.\\n- Comparison across time windows: the early descent (t=0\u2013120) is smoother and slower, the mid rise (t\u2248150\u2013300) is the steepest upward change and low-volatility, and the late trough (t\u2248400\u2013440) is deep and broad but SHAP shows it as less positively attributed here (neutral/weak).\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and preliminary label choice:\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary key points: strong positive SHAP at low frequency near t\u2248150\u2013220 corresponding to trough\u2192sustained upward ramp to a mid positive peak; also positive attribution at the long final recovery from deep trough to end. The pickup description emphasizes a diagnostic deep trough followed by a relatively fast, high-amplitude rebound and mid-rise that the model uses.\\n  - Sample 54 matches these pickup markers: (a) SHAP-red concentrated at t\u2248150\u2013220 (exactly the trough\u2192rise interval invoked in label 1), (b) a steep mid-rise to a local peak ~+1.5, and (c) a deep later trough followed by recovery (present though less highly attributed in SHAP for this instance). STFT and microstructure (low volatility and small ripples at extrema) also match the label-1 pattern.\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary key points: also emphasizes dominant low-frequency lobes, positive attribution for sustained positive plateaus around t\u2248200\u2013300 and end, trough\u2192rise\u2192plateau motifs. Sedans share many morphological similarities (low-frequency envelope, mid positive plateaus). Sample 54 does show those sedan-like broad lobes and plateaus, so it has substantial overlap.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary key points: strong positive attribution at a very deep mid-late trough (t\u2248420\u2013480) and an associated feature sequence (front bulge, mid trough, deep rear trough). While Sample 54 has a deep trough around t\u2248420\u2013440, its SHAP does not emphasize that trough as the primary positive cue; the dominant SHAP is earlier. Therefore the sample only partially matches label 2.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary key points: strong positive attribution for a long, smooth, high-amplitude rising shoulder in the midsection (t\u2248110\u2013220) culminating in a rounded peak; SUVs also show a deep trough later but with different attribution patterns. Sample 54 does show a mid long rise/rounded peak that could be SUV-like; however the model's SHAP here aligns more strongly with the pickup pattern (t\u2248150\u2013220 trough\u2192rise) rather than the SUV-specific higher-amplitude shoulder being the dominant unique cue.\\n- Preliminary conclusion: the strongest, most specific match is with label 1 (pickup) because the exact low-frequency trough\u2192rapid sustained rise from ~150\u2013220 is both present in the signal and is the timespan where SHAP gives the highest positive attribution in Sample 54. Label 0 (sedan) is also similar but less specific (many low-frequency vehicles share similar envelope shapes). Labels 2 and 3 share partial features but fewer of the decisive, SHAP-highlighted traits for this sample.\\n- Preliminary similarity scores (prior to reference-sample cross-check): label0 = 3, label1 = 4, label2 = 2, label3 = 2.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check against the reference examples and final verification:\\n- Reference comparisons:\\n  - Similar references labelled 1 (Samples 49, 14, 31): their time-series shapes, STFT low-frequency concentration and SHAP maps show red concentrated at the same low-frequency mid window (~150\u2013220). Their plots are visually nearly identical to Sample 54 (same mid trough \u2192 steep rise \u2192 rounded mid-peak \u2192 deep late trough \u2192 recovery pattern). This strongly supports the label-1 assignment and confirms the SHAP-driven cue in the same time window is the classifier's decisive evidence for pickup.\\n  - A similar reference labelled 0 (Sample 36): also looks very like Sample 54, illustrating that sedan/pickup share global envelope shapes. The distinguishing factor in the training set descriptions is which low-frequency half-cycle the model weights more strongly; in Sample 54 the model's SHAP concentrates on the mid trough\u2192rise which matches many label-1 training examples.\\n  - Dissimilar examples labeled 3 or 1 (Samples 51 and 59): these show different attribution patterns or deeper trough magnitudes and different timing of the strongest SHAP regions. Sample 54 aligns more closely with the cluster of label-1 examples than with the dissimilar SUV example.\\n- Fairness & scoring logic: given that SHAP localizes the decisive positive evidence to t\u2248150\u2013220 (a canonical pickup discriminative window per the label-1 summary) and multiple nearest-neighbor training examples with the same visual+SHAP pattern are labeled 1, assigning label 1 is consistent and fair. Because sedan (label 0) shares many broad features, it gets a moderate similarity score but not top score because the classifier attribution in this instance lines up with pickup examples specifically.\\n- Final per-label similarity scores (1\u20134) after cross-checking with reference samples and summaries:\\n  - label 0 (sedan): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 global low-frequency envelope and mid-plateau present, but SHAP emphasis in this sample better matches pickup examples)\\n  - label 1 (pickup): 4 (high similarity \u2014 exact trough\u2192rise temporal window is SHAP-highlighted and matches multiple reference samples labeled 1)\\n  - label 2 (minivan): 2 (low similarity \u2014 deep late trough exists but is not the primary SHAP-attributed region here; other minivan-specific features are weaker)\\n  - label 3 (SUV): 2 (low similarity \u2014 mid-rise exists but the full SUV-specific attribution pattern and subsequent distinguishing substructures are not a close match)\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1 (pickup) with confidence score 4.

      "{\n    \"result\": [\"label 1\"],\n    \"score\": [4],\n    \"rationale\": [\n        \"Step 1 \u2014 Local (red SHAP) feature description:\\n- Location and mapping: The SHAP heatmap shows the strongest red (positive) attribution concentrated at the lowest frequency row and centered roughly over time steps ~150\u2013210 (with a smaller, weaker red blip around ~300\u2013320). This identifies the model\u2019s most important evidence in the slow (very-low-frequency) component during that mid-sequence interval.\\n- Corresponding time-series manifestation (t \u2248 150\u2013210): In the raw trace this interval covers the trough-to-rise transition: the series sits near a local negative trough (\u2248 -1.0 to -1.25 around ~160\u2013185) and then begins a sustained, low-volatility upward ramp. Amplitude: values move from roughly -1.25 up toward ~0 and beyond; the full trough\u2192peak half-cycle that follows reaches \u2248 +1.5 to +1.6 by ~270\u2013310. Change rate: the rising limb that begins in the red window is relatively steep for this dataset \u2014 average local slope in the strongest-attribution segment is on the order of ~+0.02\u2013+0.035 units/step (i.e., a clear, large low-frequency ascent rather than a sharp impulse). Volatility & substructure: volatility is low during the red window \u2014 the rise is smooth with only small, short-period ripples and a slight shoulder/plateau just before the mid/late peak. Shape: a broad, low-frequency negative-to-positive half-cycle (deep trough followed by steady, large-amplitude rise) with a modest rounded top later.\\n- Frequency support: The STFT confirms energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during these times; there is negligible power at mid/high frequencies. That supports the SHAP attribution being tied to slow envelope shape rather than high-frequency noise.\\n- Interpretation: The classifier is positively attributing the slow trough\u2192sharp low-frequency rise (and subsequent approach to a high plateau) as evidence for the predicted class. The red pixels are co-located with the beginning and main portion of the trough-to-recovery event rather than with small high-frequency ripples.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall sample features and temporal dependence:\\n- Global waveform: The series is dominated by long-wavelength, low-frequency envelope structure with roughly two large half-cycles across the 577 points: (1) an initial high (~+1.6) descending into a broad trough near t~160 (\u2248 -1.1 to -1.25), (2) a strong low-frequency ascent to a broad positive crest around t~270\u2013310 (\u2248 +1.5\u20131.6), (3) a subsequent long descent into the deepest trough near t~420\u2013440 (\u2248 -1.6 to -1.7), and (4) a final steady recovery to a high positive plateau by the series end (~+1.5\u20131.6). The envelope is smooth overall with only small micro-ripples at extrema.\\n- Asymmetry & rates: The mid-sequence ascent (trough \u2192 crest) is one of the steepest upward slopes in the record, while the later descent into the deepest trough is also relatively steep. The final recovery is sustained and smooth. These asymmetric slopes (steep rise then steep fall then sustained recovery) form a distinctive temporal order that the classifier can exploit.\\n- Volatility & frequencies: Low short-term volatility across plateaus; micro-oscillations appear primarily at extrema. STFT shows energy nearly entirely in the lowest frequency bins throughout, reinforcing that discrimination is based on large-scale outline shape.\\n- Interaction of events: The important events combine in time: an early trough provides context, the mid trough\u2192rise creates the principal discriminative event (as highlighted by SHAP), and the late deep trough plus recovery consolidate the global oscillatory pattern. The timing and amplitude of these large half-cycles (positions of troughs and peaks and inter-event slopes) constitute the main temporal dependencies.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label patterns (which labels\u2019 summaries contain this pattern?):\\n- Label 1 (pickup): The pickup pattern description emphasizes a pronounced trough near t~150\u2013220 followed by a strong, relatively fast low-frequency ascent to a high plateau (~+1.4 to +1.6), plus a later deep trough and sustained final recovery. The SHAP signatures described for pickup concentrate positive attribution at the trough\u2192recovery window near t~150\u2013220 and again on the final recovery. The test sample shows the same mid-sequence trough-to-large-rise (strong red SHAP at ~150\u2013210), similar amplitudes (~-1.2 \u2192 +1.5) and comparable low-frequency concentration in the STFT. Match: high.\\n- Label 0 (sedan): The sedan summary also emphasizes low-frequency broad lobes with positive attribution on sustained upward transitions and plateaus (notably around t~150\u2013360 and near the end). The test sample shares many of these broad low-frequency lobes, but the pickup description specifically emphasizes the strong mid trough\u2192rapid rebound as a key cue while sedan attribution often favors the later plateaus more. Match: moderate.\\n- Label 2 (minivan): Minivan descriptions place very strong positive weight on a deep trough around t~420\u2013480 as the primary discriminative element. Our sample does have a deep trough near t~420\u2013440, but the SHAP heatmap for this sample does not show the strongest red there \u2014 the model instead highlighted the earlier trough\u2192rise. Thus although a late deep trough exists (supporting some similarity), the primary attribution differs. Match: low-to-moderate.\\n- Label 3 (SUV): SUV summaries highlight a broad low-frequency mid-rise/shoulder (t~110\u2013220) as positive evidence but typically describe a different combination of slope/shoulder and later structures. The sample shares a midrise but the ensemble of events and the SHAP localization corresponds better with pickup. Match: low-to-moderate.\\n\\nQuantified similarity (1\u20134) relative to each label (used to decide final class):\\n- Label 1 (pickup): 4 (high similarity). Rationale: Mid-sequence trough \u2192 pronounced low-frequency ascent to a high plateau; STFT and SHAP alignment; close match to multiple reference samples labeled 1.\\n- Label 0 (sedan): 3 (moderate). Rationale: Similar low-frequency lobes and end plateau, but SHAP emphasis and the steeper midrise align more with pickup.\\n- Label 2 (minivan): 2 (low). Rationale: Sample has a deep late trough like minivan descriptions, but SHAP does not emphasize that trough as the strongest positive cue here.\\n- Label 3 (SUV): 2 (low). Rationale: Some shared midrise features but other characteristic SUV motifs (valley\u2192shoulder combination with SHAP emphasis in slightly different windows) are less consistent than pickup.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against reference samples and final decision:\\n- Visual and attribution comparison: The provided similar reference samples (samples 49, 14, and 31) are labeled 1 and are visually and spectrally very close to the test sample: identical envelope shapes (initial decline \u2192 mid trough \u2192 strong rise to ~+1.5 \u2192 descent to deep trough \u2192 final recovery), concentrated STFT energy at the lowest frequencies, and SHAP heatmaps that highlight the same ~150\u2013210 low-frequency window. One similar sample labeled 0 (sample 36) shares some envelope traits, but its SHAP distribution and subtle slope/plateau differences make it less consistent than the labeled-1 references.\\n- Dissimilar references: The dissimilar labeled-3 sample (51) has more complex mid-late structure and different SHAP emphasis; sample 59 (though labeled 1) shows some differences in SHAP localization and higher-frequency small bumps; neither contradicts the high similarity between the test sample and the labeled-1 references.\\n- Consistency & fairness: The decision is driven by (a) where the model\u2019s SHAP heatmap places positive weight (strongest at low frequencies around 150\u2013210), (b) the exact morphological event at that time (deep trough followed by a steep, sustained low-frequency rise to a high plateau), and (c) the strong match to multiple training references labeled 1. Given that all three criteria align with the pickup pattern description, labelling the test sample as label 1 is consistent and fair.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 1 (pickup). Similarity/confidence score: 4 (high similarity).\"\n    ]\n}",

Minivan summaries emphasize a very deep, wide trough late in the series (around ~420\u2013470) and large low-frequency envelope features.

Their STFTs and SHAP heatmaps concentrate energy and positive attribution in the same lowest-frequency bins at the same windows (notably the late trough/recovery). Dissimilar examples (labels 0 and 1) show different SHAP localization and different mid-section emphasis. Given the near one-to-one correspondence of the test sample's dominant low-frequency late trough + recovery with the label-2 templates and the matching reference examples, I assign label 2 (minivan) with high confidence.

Amplitude ~2.2\u20132.3 (peak-to-trough relative to initial +1.7). The descent is smooth and low-volatility (no sharp spikes), with only fine micro-ripples (amplitude \u2248 0.01\u20130.05). STFT confirms energy concentrated at the lowest bin. SHAP red here indicates this smooth, broad early trough (its depth and width) is positive evidence.\\n- Window B (t \u2248 200\u2013320): The trace executes a sustained low-frequency rise from negative values through zero to a plateau/crest around +0.8\u20131.1 (local maxima ~ +0.9\u20131.1 around 260\u2013320). The rise rate is moderate (average slope ~ +0.015\u2013+0.02 units/step), the plateau has small superposed short ripples and one sharper micro-spike near ~312. Volatility remains low overall. STFT again shows bottom-bin energy; SHAP red identifies this slow ramp + plateau as positive evidence (the classifier likes the mid-segment roofline/crest).\\n- Window C (t \u2248 350\u2013375): A short, sharper positive excursion (a brief local bump/shoulder) that is of shorter duration and slightly higher slope than surrounding ramps. SHAP gives modest red support here \u2014 treated as a supportive outline detail.\\n- Window D (t \u2248 410\u2013475): The most salient positive SHAP area aligns with a steep descent afterwards into the global trough (~t=445\u2013470) and the trough itself (minimum \u2248 -1.9 to -2.05 around ~460\u2013470). That trough is wide and smooth; immediately after it the series starts a strong, nearly monotonic recovery. SHAP red on the low-frequency band over this interval signals that the presence, width and depth of this late trough (and the transition out of it) are strong positive evidence for the predicted class.\\n- Window E (t \u2248 520\u2013576): The final segment is a steady, relatively steep rise from negative/near-zero back up to the highest observed values (~+2.0 at the end). SHAP shows weaker but still positive low-frequency attribution here; STFT shows increased low-frequency magnitude at the end. This final recovery/terminal high plateau is treated as confirming evidence.\\n- Frequency content for all red windows: STFT shows almost all energy at lowest frequency bins during those time ranges; there is minimal mid/high-frequency energy. This confirms the classifier is using long-timescale envelope shapes (broad troughs/crests and their timing) rather than fast oscillations.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and temporal dependency:\\n- Global shape: A low-frequency dominated oscillatory envelope with roughly two long half-cycles: initial high \u2192 broad trough (~t\u2248100) \u2192 mid crest/plateau (~t\u2248260\u2013320) \u2192 deep trough (~t\u2248450\u2013470) \u2192 strong final recovery to a terminal high (~t=576). The amplitude range is large: peaks \u2248 +2.0 and deepest troughs \u2248 -2.0.\\n- Volatility: Low overall. The waveform is smooth on large scales with small micro-ripples concentrated at extremal regions (peaks/trough bottoms and brief shoulders). Those micro-ripples are visible in the raw trace but contribute little energy in STFT and little SHAP weight except as minor modifiers.\\n- Slopes and asymmetry: The midrise (200\u2013320) is a steady low-frequency ramp; the fall into the deep trough (\u2248320\u2013460) is comparatively steeper. The final recovery from trough to end (\u2248470\u2013576) is a sustained, relatively steep rise. The classifier emphasizes the sequence trough \u2192 slow/steady rise \u2192 sustained plateau and especially the deep late trough + recovery.\\n- Temporal dependence: The discriminative evidence is distributed and time-ordered. The classifier gains confidence from the presence and timing of the early trough, the mid-plateau, the large late trough, and the final recovery. These events together form a composite silhouette signature (front bulge \u2192 cabin/roof crest \u2192 rear deep recess \u2192 rear rise) rather than any isolated, short-lived spike.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match-to-label analysis using provided label patterns:\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary features: dominant low-frequency envelope, early front bulge followed by broad mid trough, a central roofline rise/plateau, a dominant deep rear trough around mid/late window, and a strong final recovery to the end. SHAP for label-2 examples is concentrated at the lowest frequency band at these time windows. The test sample matches almost every described element: early trough/hump, mid slow rise + small spike, a very deep broad trough near t\u2248440\u2013470 that is the largest negative excursion, and a sustained final rise to +2.0. Microstructure (small bump near ~312) also mirrors the described small protrusion used by label-2 patterns. Matching degree: high.\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary features: also low-frequency dominated with deep trough + strong recoveries emphasized (notably a mid-sequence trough\u2192rapid rebound and then a final recovery). There are similarities (deep trough + recovery), but pickups\u2019 SHAP emphasis in examples was particularly on a mid-sequence trough\u2192rapid rebound pattern (and steeper midrise slopes). The test sample\u2019s strongest distinguishing attribute is the very deep late trough and the particular mid-plateau preceding it; the timing and waveform more closely match minivan examples than pickup prototypes. Matching degree: low\u2013moderate.\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary features: long, smooth low-frequency lobes with positive plateaus and broad troughs; classifier especially rewards sustained positive plateaus around mid windows and earlier gentle trough\u2192rise cycles. The test sample contains some sedan-like elements (mid plateau around 260\u2013320), but sedan descriptions emphasize different relative importance (sedan SHAP often highlights the positive plateaus as the primary cues and treats extremely deep troughs as neutral or slightly negative). Here the deep late trough is strongly positive in SHAP for this sample, which aligns less with sedan summaries. Matching degree: low.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary features: prominent long, high-amplitude upward ramp in the mid section (valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded peak) and SHAP strongly on that mid-rise/shoulder. Our sample has a mid rise/plateau but also a deeper later trough and a strong terminal recovery; the mid-rise in this sample is less dominant than the deep late trough that the SHAP map highlights. Thus SUV is less favored than minivan though it shares some midrise characteristics. Matching degree: low\u2013moderate.\\n\\nQuantified match scores (1\u20134) \u2014 initial assignment: label 2 = 4, label 1 = 2, label 0 = 1, label 3 = 2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against reference samples and final verification:\\n- All four provided \u201csimilar\u201d reference plots (Samples 34, 48, 28, 55) are labeled 2 and show nearly identical global morphology: initial descent to a shallow trough ~100\u2013160, a mid slow rise/plateau ~220\u2013320 (including small shoulder/spike), a deep rear trough near 420\u2013470, and a final steep rise to the end. Their STFTs and SHAP maps show strongest positive attribution at the lowest frequency band in the same time windows as this test sample. The test sample\u2019s red SHAP hotspots and raw-curve extrema align strongly, timewise and morphologically, with those label-2 references (same relative positions and similar amplitudes for crest/trough extremes). This corroborates label 2 assignment.\\n- Dissimilar examples: Sample 59 (label 1) contains a prominent mid-sequence trough\u2192rebound where SHAP patterns are differently distributed (more mixed low-frequency negative SHAP at some early troughs). Sample 24 (label 2) is actually labeled 2 and shows more high-frequency SHAP noise; this demonstrates some intra-class variation. The nearest-matching group is still the label-2 set.\\n- Fairness/consistency check: The classifier\u2019s SHAP emphasis on low-frequency bands in this sample, the presence of a deep, broad late trough with a sustained recovery, and the mid-plateau + small spike are the specific elements repeatedly cited in the label-2 summary. There is strong one-to-one mapping between the test sample\u2019s red-marked low-frequency windows and the canonical label-2 windows. The small differences between label-1 and label-2 (both involving troughs and recoveries) do not override the many matching minivan-specific cues (timing, amplitude, and ordering of front bulge \u2192 mid plateau \u2192 dominant rear trough \u2192 terminal rise).\\n\\nFinal decision: label 2 (minivan). Similarity score for the chosen label: 4 (high similarity). (For completeness, per the earlier comparison I estimated: label 2 = 4, label 1 = 2, label 3 = 2, label 0 = 1.)\"\n  ]\n}",

There are smaller positive patches near t \u2248 300\u2013360 as well but the three windows above are dominant.\\n- Corresponding raw-signal features and precise descriptions:\\n  * Early window (t \u2248 40\u2013100): amplitude & shape \u2014 the trace falls from an initial high (~+1.6 at t=0) through positive values and crosses toward zero, reaching a fairly broad negative trough centered near t\u2248110\u2013130 in the overall plot; the SHAP early red aligns with the descending flank and early part of this trough (so it highlights the front-region bulge and the early decline). Local volatility is low (the descent is smooth) with small high-frequency micro-ripples (~0.01\u20130.05) superposed. STFT: increased energy at the lowest frequency bins in this interval, consistent with a slow, low-frequency descent rather than a transient spike.\\n  * Middle window (t \u2248 240\u2013320): amplitude & shape \u2014 the series rises from negative/near-zero into a sustained positive plateau around +0.6\u2013+0.9 (with short plateauing and small, fast micro-fluctuations on top). The rise is smooth and predominantly low-frequency (average slope modest), with a short sharper sub-peak visible near t\u2248300\u2013330 (a localized protrusion). SHAP red focuses on the low-frequency band here, indicating the classifier counts this slow ramp + plateau as positive evidence. STFT again shows energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin during this interval with only faint higher-frequency components corresponding to the micro-ripples.\\n  * Late / major window (t \u2248 380\u2013480): amplitude & shape \u2014 the signal descends after the mid peaks into the global trough (deepest value near \u22121.8 to \u22121.95 around t\u2248430\u2013450) and then undergoes a long, smooth recovery from that trough to a strong positive final plateau (~+1.6 to +1.8) by the series end (~t=576). The SHAP red here is strong at the bottom frequency band across the trough and the immediate recovery, indicating the model treats the broad, deep negative valley plus the subsequent sustained rise as highly diagnostic. Volatility in this interval is low (smooth U-shaped trough) except for minimal micro-ripples; STFT shows the largest low-frequency magnitude here (brightest in the bottom bin), confirming this is a dominant long-timescale feature.\\n- Change rates & slopes: the descent into the mid/early trough is moderate; the rise into the mid plateau is steady; the fall into the global trough is comparatively steep, and the recovery to the end is steep-to-moderate but sustained over many time steps (long-duration rebound). All of these important segments are low-frequency dominated per the STFT and are the precise regions the SHAP heatmap marked as positive contributors for the model's decision.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall signal characterization and combination / temporal dependence:\\n- Global structure: The series is dominated by very-low-frequency envelope components that produce roughly two long oscillatory half-cycles across the 577 steps: early descent to a modest trough (~t\u2248100\u2013130), a mid positive rise/plateau (~t\u2248240\u2013320), then a deeper trough (~t\u2248420\u2013450) and a final strong recovery/plateau to the right edge. This long-wavelength oscillatory envelope contains small, localized higher-frequency ripples concentrated at extrema.\\n- Periodicity/trend: No short-period periodicity; the pattern is long-period (hundreds of steps) and the STFT shows nearly all energy in the lowest frequency bins. Trends shift slowly over large time windows rather than in brief spikes.\\n- Volatility: Low overall; micro-ripples are present at extrema but are minor relative to the broad waves. Volatility increases slightly at inflection points but remains small.\\n- Temporal dependence / feature combination: The classifier appears to use the ordered sequence of contour elements \u2014 front descent \u2192 mid rise/plateau \u2192 deep rear trough \u2192 sustained final rise \u2014 as a combined signature. The timing and relative magnitudes (mid plateau modestly positive, late trough deepest) and the sustained recovery are evaluated together; the SHAP heatmap shows additive importance across those low-frequency windows rather than concentrated importance at a single instant.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label patterns and scoring (compare to label summaries):\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary match: High. The label_2 description repeatedly highlights: an early front-region hump/decline, a mid-sequence smooth rise/plateau, a dominant deep rear trough around the mid-late region (t\u2248420\u2013480) with the strongest SHAP attribution there, and a final sustained recovery to a high positive value. Test sample 5 shows all these elements: early descent + small bulge, mid plateau (~+0.6\u2013+0.9), dominant deep trough near t\u2248430\u2013450, and a strong final rise to +1.6\u2013+1.8. The STFT and SHAP patterns (red concentrated at the lowest frequency around those same time windows) match the label_2 explanation closely. => similarity: 4 (High similarity).\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary match: Moderate. Label_1 emphasizes a diagnostic deep trough followed by a rapid recovery and a steep midrise near t\u2248200\u2013280. Sample 5 does have trough\u2192recovery cycles and a substantial recovery at the end; however, pickup descriptions emphasize an earlier mid-sequence steep ascent and the midrise/ascent shapes are slightly different in timing and emphasis compared to sample 5 (pickup's primary positive SHAP is often centered on a rapid trough-to-peak rebound earlier). Test sample 5's strongest SHAP and morphological hallmark is the late deep trough and the particular combination of front bulge + mid plateau + big rear trough, which is more consistent with minivan than pickup. => similarity: 3 (Moderate similarity).\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary match: Low. Sedan patterns emphasize dominant low-frequency lobes but with positive plateaus earlier and more symmetric two-cycle waveform and model attribution concentrated on certain trough\u2192rise motifs different in shape (sedan descriptions show two long cycles and more emphasis on positive plateaus at specific earlier times). Sample 5 shares some low-frequency envelope characteristics but the pronounced late deep trough and the exact order of mid-plateau then deeper trough are not what sedan summary emphasizes. => similarity: 2 (Low similarity).\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary match: Low to minimal. SUV descriptions emphasize a strong broad low-frequency upward ramp in the mid-section (t\u2248110\u2013220) forming a prominent rounded shoulder/peak that is the principal positive evidence. Sample 5 does not display that early-to-mid strong rising shoulder at the exact SUV times; instead the largest rise comes later as the final recovery and the most prominent trough is late and deep \u2014 a pattern that the SUV explanations actually treat as neutral or sometimes negative. => similarity: 1 (No/very low similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four similar reference samples include three labeled 2 (samples 48, 28, 34) whose plots, STFTs and SHAP maps closely match the morphology and attribution pattern of Sample 5: early descent / small front bulge, mid positive plateau with small local peaks, a dominant late trough around t\u2248420\u2013460 and a long recovery to a high positive value; those references show red SHAP concentrated at the same lowest-frequency bins aligned to the same windows. Visual inspection of those references shows near one-to-one correspondence with the test sample's envelope (amplitudes of peaks/troughs and locations). This strongly corroborates the minivan (label 2) mapping.\\n- The dissimilar references (labels 3 and 1 shown) differ: label 3 examples highlight a strong mid-section upward shoulder around t\u2248110\u2013220 (not the dominant feature in the test sample) and label 1 examples place strongest positive SHAP near different trough\u2192rebound timings or emphasize steeper mid-ascent patterns. Those differences confirm that label 2 is the best match.\\n- Fairness & scoring logic: The scoring applied above is based only on morphological and attribution pattern matches (location, amplitude, low-frequency dominance, SHAP red alignment) and compared directly to the textual summaries and reference sample images. Because Sample 5 exhibits all primary hallmarks described for label 2 (and matches multiple label-2 reference plots closely), awarding the highest similarity score (4) is justified. Pickup (label 1) shares some overlapping features (troughs and rebounds) and thus receives a moderate score (3) but not the top one because the exact timing and the prominence of the late trough are more characteristic of minivan in the provided descriptions.\\n\\nFinal classification decision: label 2 (minivan). Score for chosen label: 4 (high similarity).\\n\\nSummary (concise): The time-series shows a low-frequency-dominated envelope with (1) an early descent / front-region bulge, (2) a mid smooth rise/plateau, and (3) a dominant deep trough in the mid-late region followed by a sustained recovery to the endpoint. The STFT and SHAP heatmap confirm the classifier\u2019s attention is concentrated at the lowest frequencies during those exact windows. These features match the label_2 (minivan) pattern and training references very closely, so the sample should be classified as label 2 with high confidence (similarity score 4).\"\n    ]\n}",

The rise is smooth and sustained (low-frequency ramp) with small high-frequency micro-bumps on the plateau. SHAP shows a concentrated red patch in the lowest-frequency band overlapping this crest; STFT shows increased energy in the bottom bin. This indicates the classifier uses the mid-segment low-frequency rise/plateau as positive evidence.\",\n        \"  - Short mid-late inflection (\u2248 t 320\u2013370): There is a brief small correction near zero followed by a short sharper local spike to \u2248+1.2\u2013+1.35 (a localized protrusion), then a downward turn. This substructure is briefer than the surrounding ramps (higher local slope for the spike) but still dominated by low-frequency content; SHAP highlights it as supportive evidence, suggesting the model treats this localized protrusion as an informative outline detail.\",\n        \"  - Late trough-to-recovery (\u2248 t 410\u2013480): The trace shows the largest negative excursion in the record \u2014 a deep U-shaped trough reaching about -1.8 to -2.0 with a smooth wide base centered \u2248430\u2013450.

Comparison: Sample 5 does have a midrise, but the most strongly attributed feature is the deep late trough + recovery (positive SHAP), whereas for SUVs the mid-rise/shoulder is the primary discriminative pattern and the late deep trough is often not strongly positive.

Their STFTs show energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin, exactly like the test sample. Visual match is strong.\\n- One of the four similar references is labeled 2; that sample is similar in outline but with slightly different amplitude balance (mid peak smaller, trough more dominant) \u2014 supporting that minivan patterns can be close but typically emphasize the deep trough more than the rounded mid-shoulder.\\n- The two dissimilar references (both label 2) show more irregular mid-structure (extra intermediate peaks, different local timing) and larger amplitude excursions in other places; the test sample differs from them and instead aligns with the label 3 references.\\n- Given the very close alignment of the test sample\u2019s defining features (long mid-rise with rounded shoulder/plateau, low volatility, deep later trough, low-frequency energy) to multiple reference samples labeled 3 and to the label 3 feature summary, label 3 (SUV) is the best match.\\n\\nFinal decision and similarity scores (1\u20134):\\n- Predicted label: label 3 (SUV).\\n- Similarity scores rationale:\\n  * label 3: 4 (High similarity \u2014 multiple reference samples labeled 3 show almost the same mid-rise/rounded peak + late deep trough + end recovery; STFT and local microstructure match.)\\n  * label 0: 3 (Moderate similarity \u2014 many sedan descriptions also reference mid positive plateaus and low-frequency lobes; the sample shares those but the mid-rise shoulder and attribution pattern better match SUV.)\\n  * label 2: 2 (Low similarity \u2014 while a deep trough near 420 exists like minivan patterns, minivan descriptions place even stronger emphasis on that trough as the primary discriminative element and differ in amplitude/crest structure; only partial overlap.)\\n  * label 1: 2 (Low similarity \u2014 pickup patterns emphasize a rapid, strongly attributed rebound; the test sample's recovery is smoother and the unique pickup-specific asymmetry is not strongly present.)\\n\\nConclusion: after detailed local and global feature analysis and cross-checking against the provided reference samples and label feature descriptions, the sample is best classified as label 3 (SUV) with highest similarity = 4.\"\n    ]\n}",

The STFT/SHAP description for label 2 states the classifier places strongest positive weight on the deep mid-late trough and final recovery. The test sample matches these elements nearly identically in timing, amplitude and low-frequency dominance. I assign label_2 a similarity score of 4 (high similarity).\",\n    \"  - Label 3 (SUV): Summary stresses a large mid-section low-frequency rise (valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded peak around ~110\u2013220) as the strongest positive cue and notes a later deep trough may be neutral or mildly negative.

Sample_15's main diagnostic window is the late deep trough + long steady recovery and the mid-plateau is smoother (not the very steep rebound emphasized by pickup).

The STFT confirms that the signal energy for these intervals is concentrated at the lowest frequency bins (very slow / long-wavelength components).\\n\\n- Early positive window (t\u224840\u201390): On the time trace this corresponds to the initial decaying front followed by a small rebound. Manifestation: amplitude falls from ~+1.6 down to ~+0.6 then briefly rises to ~+1.0\u2013+1.2 in this span. Duration \u224840\u201350 time steps, volatility low (smooth curve) with small high\u2011frequency ripples on the small local crest. Change rate: moderate negative slope followed by a moderate positive ramp (|slope| \u2248 0.01\u20130.02 units/step). Shape: a short hump/shoulder on the front of the outline. STFT: energy at near\u2011zero frequency. SHAP: red indicates this slow hump is positively supporting the predicted class.\\n\\n- Mid window (t\u2248260\u2013340): Maps to the major recovery and local peak region in the center of the trace. Manifestation: the series rises from negative values through zero to a rounded/plateau-like positive peak near +0.8\u2013+1.1 (with a small sharper local protrusion around t\u2248310\u2013340). Volatility: low overall, micro-ripples visible at the crest. Change rate: a steady long ramp, then a short steeper bump at the local protrusion. STFT: again low-frequency dominated. SHAP: moderately red here, indicating the model treats this slow rise + small protrusion as positive evidence.\\n\\n- Late (dominant) positive window (t\u2248460\u2013520): This aligns with the deepest trough followed by a strong final recovery. On the time plot the trough minimum occurs around t\u2248450\u2013480 at approximately \u22121.8 to \u22121.95 (deepest value), followed by a smooth, nearly linear recovery from that trough up to about +1.5\u2013+1.6 by the end (t=576). Duration of trough and recovery combined \u2248120 time steps. Volatility is low on the recovery (smooth) and the trough is broad and U\u2011shaped with little high\u2011frequency jitter. Change rate: steep descent into trough (pre\u2011470) then sustained, fairly strong positive slope on recovery (\u22480.02\u20130.03 units/step). STFT: largest low\u2011frequency energy co-located here. SHAP: the strongest red mass is in this low-frequency row for this window, indicating the model heavily weights this trough\u2192recovery pattern positively for the assigned class.\\n\\n- Additional microstructure: small high\u2011frequency ripples appear at extrema (tiny wiggles on crest and trough bottoms) but the STFT shows these are weak and SHAP is neutral there; the classifier predominantly relies on the large, slow envelope events listed above.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 overall time-series characterization and relationships between features:\\n- Global morphology: the series is dominated by long-wavelength, low-frequency oscillation with ~two slow half-cycles across the 577 steps: an initial high\u2192drop\u2192small hump, then a central rise/plateau, then a deep trailing trough and a final strong recovery to a high positive level at the end.\\n- Amplitude structure: starts high (~+1.6), goes to shallow/medium trough near t\u2248150 (\u2248\u22121.1 to \u22121.3), rises to a mid positive plateau (~+0.8\u2013+1.1), then falls to the deepest trough (~\u22121.8 to \u22121.95) around t\u2248450\u2013480, then recovers steadily to ~+1.5 at the end. Extremes are substantial and asymmetric (the final trough is deeper than earlier troughs).\\n- Volatility & frequency content: low short\u2011term volatility except for small ripples at extrema. STFT confirms nearly all energy is in the lowest frequency bins \u2014 the discriminative events are slowly varying envelope shapes rather than fast transients.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: the classifier appears to use the ordered sequence of features \u2014 front hump / early rise (context) \u2192 central rise/plateau (positive cue) \u2192 very deep trailing trough \u2192 long recovery to a positive plateau \u2014 as a coherent pattern. The SHAP map shows the model gives most positive weight to the trough\u2192recovery late in the record and to the central low-frequency rise, consistent with a composite decision rule that rewards this particular ordering and relative amplitudes of slow lobes.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 mapping to label feature summaries and raw similarity scoring (1\u20134):\\n- Compare to label_2 (minivan): The label_2 summary strongly matches: early front bulge (t\u224830\u2013100), a mid shallow trough (\u224880\u2013170), central roofline rise/plateau (\u2248200\u2013320) often with a small localized protrusion (\u2248310\u2013340), a dominant deep rear trough centered \u2248420\u2013480 with depth ~\u22121.9, and a final steep recovery to the end. SHAP attribution in label_2 examples concentrates positive mass at the deep trough and its recovery \u2014 exactly what we observe. Similar reference samples (Samples 35, 32, 28) labeled 2 show nearly identical envelope shape and SHAP localization. Therefore label_2 is a very high match. Similarity: 4 (high similarity).\\n\\n- Compare to label_0 (sedan): label_0 also emphasizes low-frequency lobes: troughs around t\u224880\u2013140 and positive plateau around 200\u2013300 and a deep trough around 340\u2013440 followed by final rise. There is overlap with our sample (we have a central plateau and final rise), but the deepest trough in our sample is later and deeper (\u2248470) and the timing/relative strength of central vs. trailing lobes aligns better with label_2. Many sedan examples emphasize positive attribution on central positive plateau more than the deep later trough; here the deepest late trough is the dominant discriminative event. Similarity: 3 (moderate similarity).\\n\\n- Compare to label_3 (SUV): label_3 descriptions highlight a long, broad valley\u2192broad mid rise/shoulder (strong positive attribution around t\u2248110\u2013220) and a high rounded peak in the midsection as the most discriminative feature. Our sample does have a mid rise and small shoulder but the dominant discriminative event (deep trough at t\u2248460\u2013480 with strong SHAP) and the earlier small bulge pattern better match minivan patterns. The SUVs typically show the strongest positive SHAP on midsection long rise (not primarily on a late deep trough). Similarity: 2 (low\u2013moderate).\\n\\n- Compare to label_1 (pickup): label_1 emphasizes a deep trough mid\u2011sequence followed by a relatively rapid rebound (often positive SHAP at trough\u2192recovery around t\u2248150\u2013220 and at final recovery around 418\u2013475). Although pickups also show trough\u2192recovery motifs, their characteristic mid\u2011sequence steep ascent (t\u2248200\u2013280) is more pronounced and timing differs; also label_1's strongest SHAP is often on a mid trough and then earlier recovery rather than on a dominant rear trough + recovery as in our sample. Thus pickup is a weaker match than minivan. Similarity: 2 (low similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 validation against reference examples and final decision reasoning:\\n- The three \u201csimilar\u201d reference plots labeled 2 (samples 35, 32, 28) show envelope shapes \u2014 early small front hump, mid rise with small protrusion, a very deep trailing trough and final strong recovery \u2014 that are nearly identical to Sample 15 in both timing and amplitude. Their SHAP heatmaps also concentrate positive mass at the lowest frequency around the late deep trough and central rise, as does Sample 15. This close match across shape, timing, amplitude, STFT frequency content and SHAP attribution strongly confirms label_2.\\n- The \u201csimilar\u201d sample labeled 3 and the dissimilar samples (one SUV and one pickup) share some features (low-frequency energy, two half-cycles) but differ in which time window carries the strongest positive attribution and in the relative timing/amplitude of the deepest trough. Sample 15\u2019s defining characteristic is the very deep, broad trough around t\u2248450\u2013480 with the strongest positive SHAP for the class \u2014 this matches label_2 descriptions precisely (label_2 states the deep mid/late trough is the dominant positive cue). Sedan (label_0) is close but tends to attribute more to central positive plateaus and earlier troughs whereas in our sample the late trough is the primary driver.\\n\\nConclusion and final classification: label 2 (minivan). Confidence/score: 4 (high similarity) because the sample\u2019s envelope shape, timing of crests/troughs, STFT low\u2011frequency energy, and SHAP localization correspond closely and specifically to the label_2 feature summary and to multiple reference examples labeled 2.\"\n    ]\n}"

Manifestation: amplitude about +0.3\u2013+1.1 (local bump near +0.8\u2013+1.1), low short-term volatility (smooth), moderate negative-to-positive curvature before flattening; change-rate is gentle (low-frequency ramp / small bulge), and STFT shows increased energy concentrated in the bottom frequency bin at the same times. Interpretation: a low-frequency front-region bulge (smooth outline protrusion) that the model treats as positive evidence.\\n- Red region B (mid window ~t=250\u2013340, lowest-frequency row): Maps to the long, smooth rise through zero and into a rounded plateau/peak between roughly +0.8 and +1.2 with a short sharper micro-spike/shoulder about t~310\u2013330. Manifestation: sustained upward trend (steady slope), low volatility except for micro-fluctuations on the plateau, low-frequency energy on STFT. Interpretation: a central cabin/roof rise with a small localized protrusion (distinct low-frequency hump) that the model rewards.\\n- Red region C (late window centered ~t=460\u2013490, strongest red at lowest frequency): Corresponds to the deep trough near \u22121.9 to \u22122.1 at ~t\u2248470 followed immediately by a steady, fairly steep recovery up to ~+1.4\u2013+1.6 at the series end. Manifestation: large amplitude negative excursion (deep, wide U-shaped trough), low volatility at trough bottom, followed by a strong low-frequency monotonic rise (high average slope on the recovery). STFT shows a large low-frequency magnitude here and SHAP concentrates strongly at the lowest frequency bin in that interval. Interpretation: a dominant rear recess (deep trough) plus a confirming final rise \u2014 major positive evidence for the predicted label.\\n- Additional SHAP/TF corroboration: All three red patches appear almost exclusively at the lowest-frequency row in the SHAP map and the STFT, confirming the classifier is responding to coarse, slowly varying outline features (long-wavelength lobes) rather than high-frequency texture. Blue/neutral patches are small and localized and do not override the strong positive low-frequency attributions in the windows above.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / combined time-series features and temporal dependence:\\n- Global envelope: the series is dominated by long, smooth, low-frequency oscillations spanning the 577 steps (roughly two full large-scale lobes). The dominant energy is in the lowest STFT bin throughout, with brief localized increases at the major events described above.\\n- Ordered structure: front-region high \u2192 descent \u2192 early small crest (t~40\u201390) \u2192 deeper trough (t~150\u2013200) \u2192 strong mid/central rise and plateau (t~250\u2013340) with a small shoulder/spike \u2192 long steep descent to the global deep trough (t~430\u2013480) \u2192 sustained recovery to a high terminal plateau. The late trough is the largest magnitude negative extreme, and the final recovery is steep and sustained.\\n- Volatility: overall low; micro-ripples are present at extrema (small amplitude, short duration) but the classifier\u2019s attributions are concentrated on the broad low-frequency components, indicating temporal context and the sequence of trough\u2192rise\u2192plateau\u2192deep trough\u2192recovery are what drive decisions.\\n- Interaction: the model appears to treat the combination of (early front bulge) + (mid cabin rise with local protrusion) + (late deep trough followed by a strong recovery) as a composite signature \u2014 their relative timing and amplitude strengthen the classification. The SHAP map\u2019s red clusters coincide with these ordered events, showing the classifier relies on their temporal ordering and low-frequency shape.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison to label feature summaries and preliminary similarity scoring:\\n- Label 2 (minivan): The provided label-2 pattern description explicitly lists a small early front bulge (t~30\u2013100), a mid-sequence rise/plateau and a pronounced deep rear trough near t~420\u2013480 followed by a strong end-rise. The sample matches these three hallmark features closely in timing, amplitude and appearance, and the SHAP heatmap highlights those exact low-frequency windows. => High similarity.\\n- Label 1 (pickup): Pickup summaries emphasize deep troughs followed by sharp recoveries and a strong midrise (trough\u2192rapid rebound motif). Our sample does have a strong late trough\u2192recovery (matches pickup), and a midrise, but the pickup descriptions often emphasize an earlier mid trough (t~150\u2013220) being the most diagnostic. In this sample the strongest midrise/plateau is slightly later and the early-mid troughs are less strongly attributed. => Moderate similarity.\\n- Label 0 (sedan): Sedan patterns emphasize broad positive plateaus (notably around t~200\u2013300) and smoother low-frequency lobes; sedans also show low-frequency ripples at troughs/peaks. While sample 16 has a mid positive plateau, the defining deepest trough + the exact front/mid structure align better with label 2. => Low\u2013Moderate similarity.\\n- Label 3 (SUV): SUV patterns focus on a long, high-amplitude midsection upward ramp (t~110\u2013220) with a shoulder/rounded peak that is the strongest positive cue. Sample 16 has a midrise but it is later and the overall signature of early bulge + dominant late deep trough + final recovery matches minivan more than SUV. => Low similarity.\\nPreliminary similarity ranking (for clarity): label2: 4, label1: 3, label0: 2, label3: 2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision verification:\\n- The four similar training references labelled as 2 (Samples 32 and 35) display the same ordered pattern: small early front bump near t~50\u201390, central rise/plateau with a small local protrusion around t~300\u2013340, and a pronounced deep trough around t~420\u2013470 followed by a sustained recovery to the end. Their STFT/SHAP patterns also concentrate positive attribution at the lowest-frequency rows at the same times. Sample 16\u2019s trace, STFT, and SHAP align closely with these reference examples in both morphology and attribution.\\n- The dissimilar examples (labels 3 shown) emphasize a strong midsection shoulder earlier in the window and different attribution patterns; those differ more from sample 16 than the label-2 references.\\n- Given the near one-to-one match of the three strongest positively attributed events (early front bulge, mid plateau with a local protrusion, and a dominant late deep trough plus recovery) to the label-2 textual pattern and reference examples, the classification as label 2 (minivan) is robust.\\n\\nFinal assignment and justification:\\n- Result: label 2 (minivan). Score: 4 (high similarity). Rationale summary: The sample\u2019s low-frequency, time-ordered composite of (1) a front-region bulge (~t=40\u201390), (2) a mid-sequence rise/plateau with a small protrusion (~t=250\u2013340), and (3) a large late trough near t\u2248470 followed by a strong sustained recovery to the end matches the label-2 feature summary and training references extremely closely. SHAP and STFT both confirm the classifier is using these exact low-frequency windows as positive evidence, so label 2 is the most consistent and supported choice.\"\n  ]\n}",

Change-rate: moderate negative (approx -0.02 to -0.03 units/step averaged). Volatility: very low, only small high-frequency ripples (noise-level). Shape: smooth monotonic descent (context-setting). STFT: low-frequency energy concentrated in bottom row.\\n- t = 60\u2013140: continues falling into a broad trough with minimum near -1.05 to -1.2 (trough around t\u2248100\u2013130). Descent and recovery slopes are gradual; trough bottom is relatively smooth with tiny superposed wiggles. Volatility: low. STFT: dominant very-low-frequency power during the trough.\\n- t = 140\u2013220: steady upward recovery from the trough crossing zero and continuing to rise. Rate: sustained positive slope, moderate magnitude. Small local micro-bumps on the rising flank. STFT: low-frequency energy increase aligning with the rise.\\n- t = 220\u2013300: the series reaches a broad positive peak/plateau near +1.0 to +1.3 centered roughly t\u2248260\u2013280. The plateau is rounded with small rapid fluctuations on top. Volatility: small at peak. This mid-peak is lower amplitude than some pickup-class peaks described in references (i.e., not as tall/steep as +1.6). STFT: still concentrated at the lowest frequencies.\\n- t = 300\u2013340: a short correction/descent after the mid-peak to roughly +0.35\u2013+0.5, then a brief smaller rebound/shoulder near t\u2248320\u2013330 (a localized substructure). This is a short-duration feature with slightly higher slope than the broader waves.\\n- t = 340\u2013420: a pronounced long descent into the global trough. The global minimum is deep (~ -1.8 to -1.95) around t\u2248415\u2013425. Change-rate: steep negative slope compared with earlier transitions; shape is smooth and U-shaped with low local volatility. STFT: strong low-frequency magnitude here (bright at lowest bin). \\n- t = 420\u2013520: sustained, fairly steady recovery from the deep trough back into positive values; average slope positive and relatively consistent. By t\u2248520 the signal is back near +0.9\u2013+1.0. Volatility: low, micro-ripples on the ascent.\\n- t = 520\u2013576 (end): continued rise to a final plateau around +1.7\u2013+1.8 with a tiny dip and quick recovery (~t=540\u2013550). The ending plateau is high amplitude and low volatility.\\n- Frequency summary from STFT: almost all energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin across time. Minor bursts of slightly higher low-frequency magnitude align with the major rises and the deep trough; no sustained mid/high-frequency energy.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features, temporal dependence and combination relationships:\\n- Global morphology: the sample is dominated by very-low-frequency, long-wavelength oscillation with two main half-cycles across the 577 points: (1) initial high \u2192 long descent \u2192 moderate trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 mid positive plateau, then (2) descent to a deep global trough \u2192 long recovery to a high terminal plateau. Extremes range roughly +1.7..+1.8 (max) and -1.8..-2.0 (min).\\n- Periodicity/scale: dominant period on the order of a few hundred time steps (low-frequency envelope). Microstructure (small ripples) appears only at extrema and inflection points and is weak.\\n- Volatility: low overall; the most rapid slope changes occur on the descent into the global trough and on the final recovery; local spikes are modest and brief.\\n- Temporal dependence: classifier-relevant motif is the ordered sequence trough \u2192 slow rise \u2192 mid-plateau \u2192 steep descent \u2192 deep trough \u2192 sustained recovery to end. The timing and relative amplitudes of the mid-peak and especially the late deep trough + recovery are salient.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature summaries and initial label selection:\\n- Comparison to label 2 (minivan): very strong match. Label-2 descriptions repeatedly emphasize: (a) an early descent to a modest trough near t\u224880\u2013170, (b) a mid-sequence rise/plateau of modest amplitude (~+0.9\u20131.4), (c) a dominant deep rear trough around t\u2248420\u2013470 with the largest negative amplitude (\u2248 -1.7 to -1.9), and (d) a persistent steep/steady recovery to a high terminal plateau. The sample exhibits all four elements with very similar timing, amplitude and low-frequency STFT signature. This is a high overlap.\\n- Comparison to label 1 (pickup): partial overlap \u2014 pickups emphasize strong trough\u2192fast rebound patterns and steep mid-sequence ascents to high peaks (~+1.6), and strong positive SHAP around mid and final recoveries. Sample 22 has a mid-rise and final recovery, but the mid-peak is lower amplitude and less sharp than pickup prototypes; the defining deep late trough + smooth recovery matches label 2 more closely than pickup.\\n- Comparison to label 3 (SUV): moderate overlap \u2014 SUVs emphasize a long broad mid-section rise/shoulder (~t\u2248110\u2013220) and a rounded peak; sample 22 does have a broad mid-rise/peak in that window, so some SUV-like structure exists. However SUVs in the summary often show different attribution patterns (mid-rise is the strongest positive cue and later troughs can be neutral/negative), while sample 22's deepest discriminative element is the late trough plus recovery (more minivan-like).\\n- Comparison to label 0 (sedan): weaker overlap \u2014 sedans emphasize dominant low-frequency lobes but their SHAP emphasis is on sustained positive plateaus earlier and endpoint; sedans descriptions often include micro-fluctuations at troughs but the combination of a very deep rear trough and the particular mid-peak timing in our sample better matches label 2.\\n- Based on this mapping, label 2 (minivan) is the best match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four \u201cmost similar\u201d reference plots include two labeled 2 (samples 25 and 34) and two labeled 3 (samples 21 and 40). Visual comparison: sample 22 is very close to samples 25 and 34 \u2014 same early descent into a small trough, mid-rise/rounded plateau near t\u2248260\u2013280, and a pronounced deep trough near t\u2248420 followed by a strong recovery to a high terminal plateau. Samples 21 and 40 (label 3) also look similar in mid-section but their labeling differences reflect subtle emphasis on the mid-rise as the primary discriminative feature; sample 22's largest, most conspicuous discriminative event is the deep late trough + large recovery which is exactly the label-2 hallmark in the documentation.\\n- The two \u201cdissimilar\u201d references (samples 37 and 55, both label 2) show additional high-frequency or multiple intermediate peaks (extra bumps and more jagged profiles) that our test sample does not exhibit. That explains why dissimilar-labeled-2 examples exist; despite that, the core low-frequency envelope in those dissimilar refs still places them in label 2, and sample 22 aligns better with the smoother label-2 references (25 and 34) than with those jagged ones.\\n- Scoring logic and fairness check: I compared timing of extrema, amplitudes, shape (rounded plateau vs. sharp spike), slope asymmetries, volatility and STFT low-frequency concentration. The strongest single-match features for label 2 are (a) early modest trough around t\u2248100\u2013140, (b) moderate mid-peak around t\u2248250\u2013280, (c) deepest trough around t\u2248415\u2013425, and (d) long recovery to a high terminal plateau. Sample 22 matches all four with high fidelity. Label 3 and label 1 share some substructures with sample 22 (notably the mid-rise), but lack the exact combination/ordering and relative amplitude emphasis that label 2 descriptions stress.\\n\\nFinal decision and similarity score: label 2 (minivan) is the selected class. I assign a similarity score of 4 (high similarity) because the sample\u2019s timing of troughs/peaks, relative amplitudes, low volatility, and STFT low-frequency dominance closely mirror the label-2 feature list and the provided label-2 example plots (especially samples 25 and 34). For context (not required in numeric form in the output field), relative similarity by label would be roughly: label 2 = 4, label 3 = 3 (moderate), label 1 = 2 (low\u2013moderate), label 0 = 2 (low).\"\n  ]\n}",

STFT shows a strong low-frequency energy increase aligned with this deep excursion (bright bottom-row magnitude around this interval).\\n- t \u2248 430\u2013576 (end): a strong, nearly monotonic recovery from the deep trough back to a high positive endpoint (~+1.6 to +1.7). The rise is relatively steep and smooth, with a final small dip (~t\u2248540) then immediate recovery to the terminal plateau. Volatility during the recovery is low. STFT: increased low-frequency energy during recovery and at the series end.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features, periodicity, volatility, and temporal dependence:\\n- The series is dominated by very-low-frequency components (STFT concentrated in the lowest frequency bins), i.e., slow large-scale envelope waves rather than high-frequency texture.\\n- There are roughly two large half-cycles across the sequence: an early high\u2192trough\u2192mid-rise cycle and a later large fall\u2192deep trough\u2192strong recovery to the end. The late deep trough followed by the strong recovery is the most prominent feature in amplitude and temporal extent.\\n- Volatility is generally low; local micro-ripples occur mainly at peaks/troughs and on plateaus but do not dominate. Rates of change vary: moderate initial decline, smooth mid rise, then the steepest descent into the global trough and a pronounced recovery to the end.\\n- Temporal dependence: the classifier would look at the ordering of features (front high \u2192 early trough \u2192 mid positive plateau \u2192 deep late trough \u2192 sustained end rise). The late deep trough + subsequent strong recovery forms a key composite signature (magnitude, width, and timing) that is temporally distinctive.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries (coarse mapping and similarity reasoning):\\n- Label 2 (minivan): The label-2 description emphasizes an early front bulge, a mid trough, a mid/roof rise, a prominent deep rear trough around t\u2248420\u2013470 and a strong terminal rise. In our sample the largest, reddest feature is the deep trough near t\u2248415\u2013430 followed by a strong recovery to a positive endpoint. The mid positive plateau and small local peak earlier are also present. STFT patterns (dominant bottom-bin energy and bursts aligned with trough and recovery) match the label-2 pattern. This is a very close match in both timing and amplitude profile. Similar training examples (samples 28, 34, 35) show nearly identical envelope shapes and spectral signatures. => similarity = 4 (high).\\n- Label 1 (pickup): Label-1 emphasizes a pronounced mid-sequence trough-to-fast-recovery and strong rebound evidence around ~418\u2013475 in some pickup examples. Our sample has a deep late trough with recovery (which superficially could match pickup cues). However, pickups in the summary often emphasize a steep midrise earlier and particular asymmetries (mid-sequence trough paired with a steep rebound centered earlier). Because our series' most discriminative trough is the late deep trough and the midrise is milder, pickup is a plausible but not best match. => similarity = 3 (moderate).\\n- Label 0 (sedan): Sedans are described as dominated by low-frequency lobes with positive plateaus that the model associates strongly; sedans often show broad troughs and rises but the summaries suggest the model rewards the mid positive plateau(s) and smoother shallower negative lobes. Our sample has a much deeper late trough (\u2248 -2.0) than typically cited for sedans and the discriminative emphasis in the sedan description is on sustained positive plateaus earlier. There are overlapping features (low-frequency envelope, small micro-ripples) but the deepest late trough + strong recovery is more consistent with minivan. => similarity = 2 (low\u2013moderate).\\n- Label 3 (SUV): SUVs in the summary are characterized by a strong long upward ramp/shoulder in the mid-section (t\u2248110\u2013220) with a rounded peak/shoulder and then later declines; SHAP emphasis for SUV is the mid-rise/shoulder more than an extreme late trough. Our sample has a mid-rise but the major discriminative element is the very deep late trough and recovery; the mid-rise is less dominant than in the SUV description. Thus SUV is a weaker match than minivan. => similarity = 2 (low\u2013moderate).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision reasoning:\\n- Reference samples labeled 2 (samples 28, 34, 35) are visually and spectrally very close to the test sample: same global envelope, deep late trough near ~420 and strong recovery to a high endpoint, similar mid-plateau and small sub-peaks. STFTs also match (energy concentrated at lowest frequencies with bursts at trough/recovery). That strongly supports label 2.\\n- Some training examples with other labels (e.g., sample 39, label 1) show similar overall shapes, creating ambiguity at lower confidence levels; however, the defining difference is which part of the waveform the label summaries emphasize as discriminative (pickup often emphasizes mid-to-late recoveries but with different timing/weighting; sedan/SUV emphasize different mid-section shapes). The test sample's largest discriminative event (very deep trough at ~415 and the subsequent strong recovery to the end) aligns most closely and repeatedly with the minivan (label 2) description and the provided label-2 reference plots.\\n\\nFinal classification and scoring:\\n- I classify the test sample as label 2 (minivan). The match to label 2 is strong in shape, timing, amplitude of extrema, low-frequency spectral content, and in comparison to the three provided label-2 references. I quantify the chosen-label similarity as 4 (high). For transparency, earlier in the rationale I assigned per-label similarity estimates (label2 = 4, label1 = 3, label0 = 2, label3 = 2) based on how well the test sample's features map to the provided label summaries and the reference examples.\\n\\nSummary (concise): The series is a low-frequency-dominated vehicle-outline trace with a mid positive plateau and a very deep late trough (~-2.0) followed by a strong recovery to a high endpoint \u2014 a pattern that matches the minivan (label 2) prototypes and spectrogram signatures very closely, so the sample is classified as label 2 with high confidence (score 4).\"\n    ]\n}"

This matches a long-period, smooth oscillatory silhouette (period on order of hundreds of steps). \\n- Amplitude structure: extremes span roughly +1.5 at peaks and -1.7 at the deepest trough; the second trough is the deepest. \\n- Volatility & substructure: overall volatility is low; the curve is smooth except for small high-frequency ripples concentrated at extrema and a few small local bumps (plateau shoulders) on the mid-peak. STFT confirms energy concentrated near 0 frequency with only faint higher-frequency components at those micro-features. \\n- Temporal dependence: discriminative evidence is distributed across time \u2014 the classifier rewards the sequence trough \u2192 slow upward transition \u2192 broad positive plateau (especially the mid-plateau) and the terminal recovery. The asymmetric slopes (some rises steeper than prior descents and vice versa) also appear important. \\n- Comparison across time windows: the mid positive plateau (200\u2013300) is a stable, high-amplitude low-frequency feature with the strongest SHAP-positive support; the early trough is supportive; the deep later trough contributes as part of the slow oscillatory pattern though the model seems to prefer the presence/timing of the positive lobes more strongly in this sample.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and selection of label: \\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary features: dominant low-frequency envelope with (1) early trough near t~80\u2013140, (2) first major positive lobe t~200\u2013300 around +1.5 with a short plateau and micro-fluctuations, (3) deep trough near t~340\u2013440 (~-1.7), and (4) final positive rise/plateau near the end. Major discriminative weight at lowest STFT band. \\n  -> Match to sample 27: Very high. Sample 27 shows the early trough, mid rounded positive plateau at ~200\u2013300 with micro-bumps, deep trough near ~420, and final rise to +1.5. SHAP positive pixels line up with the same low-frequency time windows. This is essentially the same motif described for label 0. \\n  -> Similarity: 4 (high similarity).\\n\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary features: also dominated by low-frequency envelope with a prominent late deep trough (t~420\u2013480) and strong positive attribution on that trough & final recovery; multiple broad crests/troughs from front to rear of outline. \\n  -> Match to sample 27: Moderate to strong. Sample 27 has the late deep trough and final recovery that minivan summaries emphasize, but the distinctive mid positive plateau + earlier trough timing/SHAP pattern in sample 27 more closely follow the sedan description. \\n  -> Similarity: 3 (moderate).\\n\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary features: model attributes strongly to a long, high-amplitude low-frequency rising shoulder around t~110\u2013220 culminating in a rounded peak/shoulder; SHAP emphasis concentrated on that mid-rise. \\n  -> Match to sample 27: Partial. Sample 27 does have a mid rise and rounded peak ~200\u2013300, but SUV descriptions often emphasize a single long rise/shoulder as the dominant cue and sometimes different trough/peak shapes. The rest of sample 27's multi-lobe structure (two distinct deep troughs and final plateau) matches sedan more closely. \\n  -> Similarity: 2 (low\u2013moderate).\\n\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary features: classifier focuses on trough\u2192sharp rebound events and strong positive SHAP on particular recovery windows (often a fast steep rebound and long recovery to final high). \\n  -> Match to sample 27: Low. Sample 27 shows slow recoveries and broad low-frequency lobes rather than isolated steep rebound events being the primary feature. While there is a recovery after the deep trough, its shape and SHAP alignment match sedan/minivan patterns better than the pickup-specific signatures. \\n  -> Similarity: 2 (low).\\n\\nBased on the comparisons above, label 0 (sedan) has the highest match (4/4).\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- Reference samples labeled 0 (samples 50 and 13) are visually and morphologically extremely close to sample 27: same early trough, mid rounded plateau near t~250, deeper trough later and final rise; their STFTs also concentrate energy at the lowest frequencies and their SHAP heatmaps emphasize the same bottom-frequency time windows. This reinforces that sample 27 is best explained by the sedan feature pattern. \\n- Reference sample labeled 2 (sample 12) shares some elements (deep later trough and final recovery) but the SHAP maps for that minivan example emphasized different bottom-band timing (and in that example some low-frequency bins had negative attribution in mid-peak), consistent with my assigning minivan a slightly lower similarity score (3). \\n- Dissimilar references (labels 1 and 3) show differing SHAP/time alignments or sharper rebound signatures which are not the dominant pattern in sample 27; hence their lower similarity scores.\\n\\nConclusion (final classification): label 0 (sedan). Rationale summary: sample 27 exhibits the canonical sedan signature from the provided label summaries \u2014 dominant very-low-frequency envelope with an early deep trough (\u224880\u2013140), a broad rounded mid positive plateau (\u2248200\u2013300 at \u2248+1.5) with small micro-bumps, a deeper trough (\u2248340\u2013440 near \u22121.7), and a final sustained rise/plateau to \u2248+1.5. The STFT and SHAP support this: energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin and SHAP red aligned with the same low-frequency windows. Cross-check with reference examples labeled 0 confirms a highly consistent match. Therefore label 0 is chosen with maximum similarity score 4.\"\n  ]\n}",

SHAP is strongest here (deep red), so the classifier relies heavily on this sustained low-frequency positive lobe / rounded peak as positive evidence.\",\n    \"  - Window t\u2248360\u2013440 (deep trough): the series falls steeply after the mid-peak to the global minimum ~\u22121.6\u2026\u22121.8 (deepest ~t\u2248420). The descent is one of the steepest in the record and the trough is relatively narrow and slightly sharper than the first trough. STFT again shows low-frequency dominance.

SHAP attribution for sedans is concentrated at the bottom-frequency band at the mid-rise and final plateau. Our sample matches that description strongly in timing, amplitude, low-frequency energy and SHAP concentration.

Our sample contains a midrise and a late recovery, and shows positive SHAP there, so it shares many structural elements with pickups. However, pickups in the reference list put more relative SHAP weight specifically on the late rebound as the prime cue; in sample 27 the strongest SHAP red is concentrated around the midrise and mid-plateau as well as the end plateau, which matches sedan more closely.

Our sample has a deep trough there and modest red at that time, but the SHAP emphasis is distributed (stronger at the midrise/peak and final plateau) rather than being dominated solely by the late trough. Reference minivan examples (Sample 12) are similar in envelope shape but place stronger SHAP weight on the trough itself.

Our series has a very similar mid-lift and rounded peak that SHAP marks strongly. SUVs also sometimes show a deep later trough which may be neutral or slightly negative; that matches our mixed SHAP near the deep trough. SUVs and sedans share the midrise/rounded-peak signature, but the full sequence (including the timing and the presence of the final positive plateau) aligns more tightly with the sedan description in the provided dataset.

Volatility at the trough is low (smooth descent/ascent) with only tiny ripples; STFT indicates increased magnitude at the lowest frequency bin at the same times. This trough aligns with strong positive SHAP attribution (the model treats it as strong evidence).\\n- SHAP red cluster #4: ~t=520\u2013576 (bottom frequency). Corresponds to the steady recovery from the deep trough back into a high positive value at the series end (final rise reaching \u2248+2.0). Manifestation: nearly linear smooth climb with low local volatility; low-frequency energy elevated at the end in the STFT.\\n- Summary of local findings: all positively attributed (red) regions are in the lowest STFT frequency band and correspond to slow, large-amplitude envelope features: an early trough, a mid positive plateau, a deep late trough, and a sustained end rise. Microstructure (small ripples) is present but secondary and not strongly attributed.\",\n        \"Step 2 \u2014 Global / temporal feature summary and dependencies:\\n- Global shape: a long-period oscillatory envelope with roughly two full half-cycles across 577 points: initial high \u2192 smooth descent to ~-1.1 (\u2248t\u2248100) \u2192 steady rise to a rounded mid-peak (~t\u2248270\u2013300) \u2192 descent into a deep trough (~t\u2248430\u2013445) \u2192 strong recovery to a high positive terminal value (~t\u2248576).\\n- Amplitude: max \u2248 +2.1 at the left edge and end; min \u2248 -2.2 at the deep trough. So the signal has large symmetric extremes but the deepest negative excursion is the late trough.\\n- Volatility & frequency content: overall low short-term volatility except at the inflection zones where small micro\u2011oscillations appear. STFT confirms nearly all energy is concentrated at the lowest frequency bins (very-low-frequency / long-timescale features) with small localized increases during the major envelope events.\\n- Temporal dependence: the classifier appears to weight the ordered sequence of envelope features (early trough \u2192 mid rise/plateau \u2192 deep late trough \u2192 long recovery) rather than instantaneous spikes. The strongest positive attribution is focused on the deep late trough and its subsequent recovery, with supporting evidence from the mid-peak and the early trough. This ordering and relative amplitudes form the composite signature.\",\n        \"Step 3 \u2014 Mapping to provided label feature summaries (which label matches best?):\\n- Label 0 (sedan): described as dominated by very-low-frequency broad lobes with positive plateaus around ~200\u2013300 and a final positive plateau; the sedan summary rewards mid and end positive plateaus and low-frequency envelope. Our sample shares low-frequency mid-plateau and end rise, but the very deep late trough (~-2.2) in this sample was described in the sedan summary as either neutral or slightly negative evidence. So there is some similarity but not the best match.\\n- Label 1 (pickup): described as having a pronounced mid trough-to-peak rebound and strong recovery from a global trough late in the series; classifier emphasis around trough\u2192recovery events. Our sample has a late deep trough and recovery, but pickup summaries emphasize an earlier discriminative trough and a steeper mid ascent to the mid-peak as the prime cue. The match is moderate but not as close as label 2.\\n- Label 2 (minivan): the summary repeatedly highlights a dominant deep U\u2011shaped trough in the mid\u2013late window (centered ~t\u2248420\u2013470, min \u2248 -1.7 to -1.9) as the strongest positive cue, plus earlier crests and a final strong recovery. The SHAP discussion for label 2 specifically calls out a strong red concentration at the deep trough and the terminal rise as the key discriminative elements. Our sample exhibits a very similar pattern: early trough, mid positive plateau, a very deep late trough (even slightly deeper than the canonical -1.9) with strong low-frequency energy and strong SHAP positive attribution, and a sustained recovery to a high terminal value. This is a high-fidelity match.\\n- Label 3 (SUV): emphasizes a broad upward ramp around ~110\u2013220 as the strongest positive contributor; while our sample has a rise in that region, the most strongly attributed region in our SHAP map is the deep late trough rather than the mid-rise. Thus SUV is a lesser match.\\n- Conclusion of Step 3: Label 2 (minivan) has the highest matching degree because the hallmark deep mid/late trough + terminal recovery + low-frequency dominance and SHAP localization exactly match the label\u20112 description. I quantify similarity to label 2 as High (4 points).\",\n        \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross\u2011check against reference samples and final verification:\\n- Similar reference samples 1 & 2 (samples 34 and 28) are labeled 2 and look nearly identical in overall envelope, the timing of the deep late trough (\u2248t\u2248420\u2013460) and the final strong recovery; their SHAP heatmaps also concentrate red in the same bottom-frequency rows at the trough and recovery windows. The close visual and attribution similarity to these reference label-2 examples reinforces the classification.\\n- Similar sample 3 (label 3) and similar sample 4 (label 1) share some mid-segment rises or trough\u2192rebound features but differ in where SHAP concentrates most strongly (those samples emphasize mid-rise or different trough timing). Dissimilar samples (label 1 examples 59 and 43) show different SHAP distributions and envelope variations. This comparison further confirms that sample 37's strongest diagnostic cue (deep late trough + recovery) aligns with the canonical label-2 pattern.\\n- Fairness and scoring logic: I scored the chosen label (label 2) as 4 because multiple independent cues in the sample map directly to label-2 descriptions: (1) low-frequency dominance, (2) an early trough + mid plateau, (3) a very deep U-shaped trough in the mid-late window with strongest SHAP attribution there, and (4) a sustained end recovery \u2014 all present and in the same temporal order as the label-2 prototypical pattern and in close visual match to two label-2 reference samples.

The descent is smooth with broad curvature (low instantaneous volatility) and contains small, short-lived wiggles at the trough bottom (micro\u2011ripples amplitude \u2248 0.01\u20130.05). STFT: energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin in this interval. Interpretation: a low\u2011frequency, broad negative lobe (slow fall into a smooth trough) \u2014 SHAP red here indicates this trough/its slow recovery is positively contributing to the predicted label.\\n\\n- Red region B (low-frequency row, approx t \u2248 200\u2013300, strongest near 240\u2013280): The trace rises from slightly negative through zero into a rounded positive plateau/peak around +1.3\u2026+1.6 centered \u2248 260\u2013280. The rise is noticeably steeper than the earlier fall (average slope in this segment larger), and the top shows a short, flattened plateau with small rapid fluctuations (tiny bumps) on the crest. STFT: increased magnitude still concentrated at the lowest frequency bin. Interpretation: a pronounced low\u2011frequency positive lobe with plateau substructure \u2014 SHAP red indicates this is a strong positive cue.\\n\\n- Red region C (low-frequency row, approx t \u2248 300\u2013360 and again \u2248 360\u2013420): The series shows a transition from the mid positive plateau down toward a deep global trough. The fall into the trough (centered \u2248 420) is the steepest descent in the record; trough amplitude reaches about -1.6 to -1.85 (deep negative). The trough is narrower and a bit sharper than the first trough but still smooth overall with small ripples along the flanks. STFT: strong low-frequency power at the trough times. SHAP: red weight is present around the descent/recovery windows (particularly the downturn-to-recovery boundaries), indicating the model credits the shape and timing of this deep valley and the surrounding transitions.\\n\\n- Red region D (low-frequency row, approx t \u2248 420\u2013576, strongest near 470\u2013576): From the global trough the signal climbs steadily to a final high plateau \u2248 +1.5\u2026+2.0 at the end of the sequence. The recovery is long-duration and fairly linear on average (sustained positive slope, low local volatility). STFT shows low-frequency power increase on this long rise. SHAP red on the low-frequency band here indicates the late, sustained recovery/terminal high is positive evidence for the predicted class.\\n\\nSummary of local features: every SHAP-red patch maps to smooth, long-timescale envelope events (broad troughs and broad peaks and the transitions between them). Event amplitudes: troughs \u2248 -1.1 to -1.85, peaks \u2248 +1.3 to +2.0. Change rates: the steepest local slope is the descent into the central trough (~t 320\u2013420), while rises (especially final recovery) are sustained but slightly gentler on average. Volatility: low overall, with small high-frequency ripples concentrated at extrema; STFT confirms energy is overwhelmingly at the lowest frequency bins so the events are long-wavelength shapes rather than transients.\",\n        \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Global structure: the series is dominated by very-low-frequency, long\u2011wavelength oscillations (roughly two slow cycles across 577 steps). The big half-cycles are: initial high \u2192 broad first trough (~80\u2013140) \u2192 mid positive plateau (~200\u2013300) \u2192 deep central/trailing trough (~340\u2013440) \u2192 long recovery to a terminal positive plateau (~500\u2013576).\\n- Periodicity/trend: no short, repetitive high-frequency oscillation \u2014 rather a slowly varying oscillatory envelope (period on the order of a few hundred steps). The STFT map shows concentrated energy in the bottom frequency band throughout.\\n- Volatility and substructure: low short-term volatility except for localized tiny ripples at peaks/trough bottoms and a few short bumps on plateaus. These microstructures appear in STFT only as weak, faint higher-frequency energy and have comparatively small SHAP weight.\\n- Temporal dependence (how features combine): the classifier appears to use the ordered sequence of envelope events \u2014 trough \u2192 steady rise \u2192 sustained positive plateau \u2192 deep trough \u2192 long recovery \u2014 as a coherent signature. The relative amplitudes (moderate first trough, high mid-plateau, deeper later trough, and strong final recovery) and the asymmetry of slopes (some descents steeper than rises) are important. The SHAP heatmap concentrates positive attribution on low-frequency rows at the times of the main half-waves and the recovery boundaries, consistent with the model relying on shape and timing of large-scale outline features rather than momentary spikes.\",\n        \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label summaries (which label best explains the observed features?):\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary: emphasizes dominant very-low-frequency envelope with first trough near t ~80\u2013140 (~-1.15), mid broad positive peak ~200\u2013300 (+1.5), a deep narrower trough near ~340\u2013440 (~-1.7), and a final positive plateau near the end. SHAP red concentrated at low-frequency bands during these lobes is described as characteristic. This matches the sample's events almost exactly in timing, shape, amplitude and the SHAP attribution pattern. -> High similarity.\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary: emphasizes trough\u2192steep rebound patterns, strong midrise and a long final recovery; some descriptions place heaviest positive SHAP on the late recovery. Our sample does show a long final recovery, and midrise exists, but the precise pattern (timing, plateau shapes and the initial trough characteristics) align somewhat less perfectly with the pickup description than with the sedan description. -> Moderate similarity.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary: also describes multiple broad crests/troughs and a dominant late deep trough with strong low-frequency energy and a subsequent final rise. Several minivan reference descriptions emphasize the deep late trough and the final recovery as key evidence \u2014 which this sample also shows. However the mid-peak amplitudes and earlier trough morphology in this sample are more consistent with sedan examples in the reference text. -> Moderate similarity.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary: emphasizes a pronounced long upward ramp around t\u2248110\u2013220 culminating in a rounded shoulder/peak and that region receives the strongest SHAP support. While our sample has a midrise in that window, the overall combination of two long cycles and the exact sequence of amplitudes (first trough ~120, rounded mid plateau, deeper later trough, then final rise) aligns more closely with label 0 than label 3. -> Lower similarity.\\nConclusion of step 3: label 0 (sedan) is the best match. I quantify similarity (1\u20134) qualitatively here: label 0 = 4 (high), label 1 = 3 (moderate), label 2 = 3 (moderate), label 3 = 2 (low-to-moderate). The predicted label is label 0 (sedan) with highest similarity score.\",\n        \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- Reference samples shown for label 0 (e.g., Sample 10 and the textual label_0 description) exhibit the same sequence: an early smooth trough near t\u224880\u2013140, a mid positive plateau around 200\u2013300, then a deeper trough ~340\u2013440 and a sustained final rise to a positive plateau. Their SHAP heatmaps also concentrate red in the lowest-frequency rows at those time windows. The test sample's time plot and SHAP heatmap closely mirror these references in timing, amplitude, shape and SHAP localization \u2014 confirming consistency.\\n- Reference samples for labels 1 and 2 share some overlapping features (deep trough + long recovery) which is why they received moderate similarity scores, but their emphasized substructures (for label 1, a particularly sharp mid-ascent and the precise timing of the strongest SHAP at the late rebound; for label 2, a pronounced localized mid-section protrusion plus specific trough/crest amplitude relationships) are not as exact matches to the sample as label 0's summary is.\\n- The STFT for the test sample and for the label-0 reference cases are congruent: dominant energy in the lowest frequency band with localized low-frequency power increases at the same event times. Microstructure differences across references are minor and do not outweigh the envelope-level match.\\n- Therefore the classification as label 0 is robust: sample 42 matches the sedan (label 0) pattern very closely both in raw time-domain morphology and in where the model\u2019s SHAP explanation places positive weight.\\nFinal decision: predicted label 0 (sedan). Similarity score for that label = 4 (high similarity). Additional similarity notes: label1=3, label2=3, label3=2 (as justified above).\"\n    ]\n}",

There is comparatively weak or neutral attribution at the very deep trough near t\u2248400\u2013440 (some pale/neutral pixels there).\\n- Corresponding time-series features and fine-grained descriptions:\\n  1) Window t\u224880\u2013130: The trace shows a broad negative trough reaching about -1.1 to -1.25 (minimum ~120). Shape: wide, smooth concave trough with very low short-term volatility (tiny micro-ripples visible only as small jaggedness of amplitude \u22480.01\u20130.05). Rate of change: the descent into the trough is gradual (low magnitude negative slope over many tens of steps); the trough bottom is rounded rather than sharp. STFT: increased energy concentrated at the bottom (near-0) frequency bin in this window, consistent with a slow envelope feature.\\n  2) Window t\u2248200\u2013300: A large, low-frequency positive lobe/peak centered ~260\u2013280 with amplitude about +1.3 to +1.5. Shape: broad convex rise with a short plateau/shoulder near the crest and small superimposed micro-bumps (low-amplitude high-frequency detail). Change rate: the rise is noticeably steeper than the earlier descent (average positive slope higher than the initial negative slope), but still a low-frequency, smooth ramp (no impulsive spikes). STFT: a clear low-frequency power increase aligned with this rise, supporting that the classifier is using long-wavelength shape here.\\n  3) Window t\u2248340\u2013440: A steep descent into the deepest trough of the series (global minimum near -1.7 around ~420). Shape: deeper and somewhat narrower than the earlier trough, overall smooth, low volatility at the bottom. SHAP attribution here is weak/neutral to slightly negative in places (pale blue pixels) rather than strongly positive. STFT still shows energy at lowest frequencies (large amplitude long-wavelength component).\\n  4) Window t\u2248480\u2013576 (end): A steady monotonic rise from the deep trough back to a high terminal plateau ~+1.5. Shape: smooth, sustained positive slope; small micro-variations near the late peak. SHAP shows positive low-frequency attribution near the end but weaker than the mid-peak attribution.\\n- Microstructure & frequency support: Throughout these windows micro-ripples (very short, low-amplitude wiggles) are present at extrema but the STFT shows nearly all energy at very low frequencies; SHAP reds align with the lowest-frequency band. This confirms the model is attributing based on large-scale envelope shape (amplitude, timing and slope) rather than high-frequency texture.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features, temporal dependence and combination:\\n- Global trend and periodicity: The series is dominated by a long-period oscillation (roughly two large cycles across 577 steps): initial positive baseline \u2192 broad descent \u2192 first trough (~t=120) \u2192 large rise to mid positive peak (~t=260\u2013280) \u2192 steep fall to deepest trough (~t=420) \u2192 long recovery to final high (~t=576). Periodicity is low-frequency, not regular high-frequency oscillation.\\n- Amplitude structure: maxima \u2248 +1.4\u2013+1.6, minima \u2248 -1.6 to -1.75. Two clear negative lobes (first ~-1.15, second deeper ~-1.7) and two positive lobes (mid +1.3\u20131.5 and terminal +1.5).\\n- Volatility: Low overall; small high-frequency ripples localized at extremal regions and on plateaus. Major transitions are smooth low-frequency ramps; the steepest local slope is the descent into the deep trough (~t=320\u2013420).\\n- Temporal dependence / discriminative combination: The classifier (via SHAP) places positive weight primarily on the sequence trough \u2192 slow up-ramp \u2192 sustained mid positive plateau (t\u2248200\u2013300) and also on the initial trough region (t\u224880\u2013130) and final recovery. The ordered pattern (first trough, then broad rise/plateau, then deep trough, then recovery) is the coherent long-timescale signature used by the model to decide \u2014 i.e., it values the temporal arrangement (phase) and amplitudes of broad envelopes more than isolated instantaneous values.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label summaries and preliminary label selection with similarity scoring:\\n- Compare to label 0 (sedan) summary: Very strong match. Label 0 descriptions explicitly describe (a) first trough ~t=80\u2013140 down to \u2248-1.15, (b) major positive lobe ~t=200\u2013300 reaching \u2248+1.5 with a short plateau, (c) deep trough near t\u2248340\u2013440 down to \u2248-1.7, and (d) final rise to +1.5 at the end. SHAP emphasis at low-frequency in the mid-rise and end windows is also described for label 0. The test sample\u2019s timing, amplitudes, low-frequency dominance, and SHAP localization match label 0 nearly exactly. I assign label 0 a similarity score of 4 (high similarity).\\n- Compare to label 2 (minivan) summary: Moderate to strong match. Label 2 also emphasizes very-low-frequency envelope, a deep late trough (around t\u2248420\u2013470) with strong positive attribution, and a final recovery; it also notes mid-sequence humps and a multi-crest/trough sequence. Our sample shares the late deep trough and final recovery and many envelope features, but label 2 often calls out an early small positive bulge (t\u224850\u201370) and somewhat different mid-peak morphology in some examples. SHAP in label 2 examples tends to concentrate more heavily on the deep trough as the primary positive region, whereas in our sample SHAP is strongest at the mid-rise and initial trough windows. So similarity is good but not as exact as label 0. I assign label 2 a similarity score of 3 (moderate similarity).\\n- Compare to label 1 (pickup) summary: Partial match. Label 1 describes trough\u2192sharp mid-rise\u2192global trough\u2192long recovery, with the model strongly favoring upward recoveries (SHAP red near trough-to-peak and the long final recovery). Our sample has trough\u2192rise\u2192deep trough\u2192recovery as well, but the pickup descriptions emphasize steeper mid-rise slopes and strong SHAP emphasis at the final rebound; the pickup\u2019s characteristic timing/relative attribution (for which early mid-trough timing is more diagnostic) is not as perfectly aligned as label 0. I assign label 1 a similarity score of 2 (low\u2013moderate similarity).\\n- Compare to label 3 (SUV) summary: Low similarity. Label 3 characterizations emphasize a dominant long, broad mid-rise/shoulder around ~110\u2013220 and a later deep trough, but the SHAP emphasis and shape language differ: SUVs are often identified by a strong long mid-rise shoulder as the primary evidence. While our series does have a mid-rise, the overall timing pattern (first trough ~120 then strong mid-plateau then deep trough) and SHAP localization match sedan far more closely. I assign label 3 a similarity score of 1 (low / no close match).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples (consistency check):\\n- The provided similar reference sample visuals include two labeled 0 examples (Sample 50 and Sample 13) that are visually nearly identical to the test sample: they show the same ordering and amplitudes (first trough near 100, mid-rise/rounded peak ~260\u2013300, deepest trough ~420, final rise to ~+1.5). Their STFTs likewise concentrate energy at the lowest frequency bin and their SHAP maps show red concentrated at similar low-frequency time windows. This corroborates the label-0 mapping and gives high confidence.\\n- The provided samples labeled 2 (Sample 12 and Sample 25) are also similar in the broad envelope but differ subtly in where SHAP concentrates and in some substructure (e.g., earlier small bulge or slightly different mid-peak amplitude). That explains why label 2 scores moderately high but not maximal.\\n- Dissimilar examples for labels 1 and 3 show distinctive differences in where SHAP places positive attribution (e.g., SUVs in the dissimilar sample have stronger mid-shoulder emphasis with different timing) and/or different microstructure; these differences validate the lower similarity scores assigned to labels 1 and 3.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification:\\n- Predicted class: label 0 (sedan). Rationale summary: the test sample\u2019s sequence of a broad first trough (t\u224880\u2013130, \u2248-1.1), a pronounced mid low-frequency rise/rounded plateau (t\u2248200\u2013300, \u2248+1.3\u20131.5), a deeper mid-late trough (t\u2248340\u2013440, \u2248-1.7), and a final sustained rise to a positive plateau near t\u2248576 matches the labeled-0 pattern in the feature summary and the provided label-0 reference examples very closely. The SHAP heatmap\u2019s red at the lowest frequency band during the initial trough and mid-rise windows further confirms the classifier would attribute positive evidence for sedan to those events. Cross-check against reference samples and label descriptions supports this assignment with high confidence.\\n\\nSimilarity scores (per label):\\n- label 0: 4 (high similarity)\\n- label 1: 2 (low\u2013moderate similarity)\\n- label 2: 3 (moderate similarity)\\n- label 3: 1 (low similarity)\"\n    ]\n}",

While sample 47 has a recovery after the trough, the strongest positive attribution in label_1 is tied to a very sharp rebound; sample 47's rebound is smoother and the midrise/plateau at \u2248260\u2013280 is more central to its signature. Moderate-to-low match.\\n- Label 2 (minivan): Emphasizes a very large late trough (t\u2248420\u2013480) as the main positive cue along with multiple ordered crest/trough features. Sample 47 does have a late deep trough but the overall pattern (early trough near 100, mid plateau at 260, then deep trough at 420 and end rise) and the explicit time windows align more closely with label_0. Label_2's descriptions often emphasize the late trough as the dominant and distinctive feature; here the mid positive plateau plays an equally strong discriminative role as in label_0.

Their STFTs show the same concentration at the lowest frequency bins. Sample 47 aligns closely with both.\\n- Reference samples labeled 3 (samples 5 and 7) are also similar in broad form, but subtle differences are present: label 3 references often show a slightly more pronounced mid-shoulder and different SHAP emphasis. Compared with those, sample 47's shape and the exact positions of maxima/minima correspond more directly to the label_0 pattern described earlier.\\n- Dissimilar (label 2) references show additional irregularities and multiple faster sub-peaks that do not match sample 47 as well.\\n\\nConclusion and scoring:\\n- The sample matches the label_0 (sedan) feature set extremely closely: matching time windows, amplitudes, low-frequency dominance, low volatility, and the sequence of trough\u2192rise\u2192plateau\u2192deep trough\u2192final rise exactly mirror the label_0 summary. Reference samples for label 0 (samples 50 and 20) are nearly indistinguishable from the test sample.

Volatility is low (smooth curve) with only very small high-frequency ripples at the trough bottom. Average slope on the descent \u2248 -0.015 to -0.02 units/step. Shape: broad concave trough (not a sharp spike).\\n- t = 120\u2013220: Recovery begins after the early trough. The series climbs from ~-1.2 through zero up to ~+0.3\u2013+0.8 by t\u2248200. The rise is smooth, steady and dominated by low-frequency content (no large fast oscillations). Small localized bumps appear near the mid-ascent but are minor.\\n- t = 220\u2013320: The ascent continues to a rounded, sustained positive peak/plateau centered ~t=260\u2013290 with amplitude \u2248 +1.2\u2013+1.4. The top shows a short plateau/shoulder and small superimposed micro-fluctuations (tiny bumps). The slope into the peak is somewhat steeper than the initial recovery. Volatility remains low on the plateau.\\n- t = 320\u2013440: After the mid-plateau the signal falls relatively steeply to a deeper trough centered ~t=400\u2013430 reaching about -1.5 to -1.7 (global minimum ~ -1.6 at \u2248420). The descent is smooth (low volatility) but is the steepest negative slope in the series; trough is narrower than the first trough but still fairly broad (tens of time steps).\\n- t = 440\u2013576 (end): From the deep trough the series performs a long, steady, low-volatility recovery rising roughly linearly back to a final high plateau of \u2248 +1.45\u2013+1.55 at the end. The final plateau (last ~40\u201380 steps) is fairly flat with small micro-ripples on the top.\\n- Time-frequency confirmation: The STFT image shows almost all energy concentrated in the lowest frequency rows across the whole record; only faint, localized higher-frequency content at the peaks/troughs. This corroborates that the dominant structures are long-timescale (low-frequency) envelope shapes rather than high-frequency texture.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal relationships:\\n- The sample exhibits a low-frequency, oscillatory envelope with approximately two long half-cycles across 577 steps: an initial high \u2192 broad negative trough \u2192 large positive plateau \u2192 deeper negative trough \u2192 final recovery to a high plateau. The main amplitudes are roughly +1.4 at peaks and -1.6 at the deepest trough. Volatility is low overall, with micro-ripples localized at extrema.\\n- Temporal dependence: classification-relevant structure is the ordering and relative amplitudes of extrema: early trough (~100), strong mid positive plateau (~260\u2013290), deeper late trough (~420), and a sustained final positive plateau to the end. The largest changes are long-duration, low-frequency ramps (rise to mid-peak, fall to late trough, recovery to end). The mid-peak plus the final plateau are persistent, low-volatility positive features that form strong positive envelope evidence.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Pattern matching to label descriptions (summary):\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary match: Very high. Sedan reference emphasizes dominant low-frequency lobes: an early trough (~80\u2013140), a broad mid positive peak (~200\u2013300) often with a short plateau and micro-wiggles, a steeper/deeper trough around ~340\u2013440, and a final positive plateau to the end. Our sample matches those points closely in timing, amplitude and shape (rounded mid-peak, deep trough near 420, final high plateau). STFT low-frequency dominance also matches. => similarity: 4/4.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary match: High to moderate. SUV descriptions emphasize a long, high-amplitude upward ramp ~110\u2013220 culminating in a rounded shoulder/peak, followed by a deep trough later. Our sample indeed has a pronounced low-frequency rise and rounded peak in that interval; many SUV reference samples look visually similar. Differences: SUV descriptions sometimes emphasize the mid-rise/shoulder as the single strongest discriminative event and occasionally deeper later troughs (~ -2.0); our sample's trough depth is closer to -1.6 and the classifier descriptions for sedan emphasize the combination of mid-peak + final plateau more strongly. => similarity: 3/4.\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary match: Moderate to low. Pickup description centers on deep trough-to-rapid-rebound events (notably a strong recovery around t\u2248418\u2013475 as the main cue) and an asymmetric oscillation with a sharp mid-rise. Our sample does have a long recovery to the end, but the characteristic pickup documentation puts stronger positive weight on the rapid rebound from the deepest trough (with that rebound being the most diagnostic). In our sample the rebound is steady and ends in a sustained plateau (more sedan-like) rather than being the distinctive pickup-shaped rebound. => similarity: 2/4.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary match: Low. Minivan summaries emphasize a very deep, broad late trough (often near -1.8 to -1.9) as the primary positive cue, plus specific early bulges and a distinctive mid-structure. Our sample's late trough is deep but not as extreme as many minivan descriptions; the minivan references also often show slightly different crest/trough spacing. The STFT behavior is similar (low frequency), but the exact amplitude pattern (mid-plateau + final plateau) aligns better with sedan. => similarity: 1\u20132/4 (leaning 2/4 because of one shared deep trough but overall mismatch).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- Visual cross-check: The provided 'similar' references include two label-0 examples (samples 50 and 20) that are nearly isomorphic to the test sample in timing and amplitude of extrema (early trough around 100, mid plateau around 260\u2013290, deep trough \u2248420, final rise to \u2248+1.5). Two other similar references are label-3 but those are also close; however the pair of label-0 references match the combination (mid plateau + final plateau) especially well.\\n- Dissimilar references (label-2) show more irregular midstructure and typically deeper late troughs (~ -1.9 to -2.0) and sometimes additional short-scale bulges; those patterns are visibly different from the test sample.\\n- Given: (a) the close alignment in timing and amplitude of the mid positive plateau and final plateau, (b) the relative trough depths and their shapes, and (c) the STFT low-frequency dominance, the best match is label 0 (sedan). The sample shows the key sedan fingerprint: mid-section rounded positive plateau + final sustained positive plateau flanked by low-frequency troughs.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 (sedan) with high confidence.\\nPer-label similarity integers (for traceability): label 0 = 4, label 3 = 3, label 1 = 2, label 2 = 2.\\n\\nConclusion: result = label 0; overall score (for chosen label) = 4.\"\n  ]\n}"

The STFT confirms that energy at these times is concentrated in the very lowest frequency bins (long-timescale structure), so the important events are slow, large-scale shape changes, not high-frequency spikes.\\n- Late strongest red region (t\u2248440\u2013480): In the time trace this corresponds to the deep U-shaped trough that reaches the series minimum \u2248 -2.0 near t\u2248470. Description: amplitude \u2248 -2.0 (deepest value in the record), width ~60\u201380 steps (the trough is broad), volatility extremely low at the trough bottom (smooth curvature, no large jitter), descent/ascent slopes are pronounced (relatively steep fall into the trough then a smooth, sustained recovery). STFT shows an increase in low-frequency magnitude at the same time. SHAP strongly positive here, so the classifier treats this broad deep negative half-wave as strong evidence.\\n- Mid red region (t\u2248310\u2013370): Maps to the large positive crest/peak just before the deep trough. Description: amplitude \u2248 +1.4 to +1.9 (peak around t\u2248366), shape is a tall, broad convex hump with low local volatility, and a short shoulder/inflection just before the descent; the fall from this crest into the late trough is relatively steep. STFT again shows low-frequency energy; SHAP moderate positive here \u2014 the model rewards the crest\u2192trough pairing.\\n- Early red region (t\u224850\u201390): Corresponds to the small local positive bulge/crest early in the record (after an initial decline from the start). Description: amplitude \u2248 +0.8\u20131.2, short duration (~30\u201340 steps), smooth with small micro-ripples on top. STFT low-frequency content and small positive SHAP indicate this early bulge is a supporting cue for the class.\\n- Final recovery (t\u2248500\u2013576): Although the SHAP map\u2019s strongest red is at the trough, the time-series shows a smooth, fairly steep recovery from the trough up to ~+1.7 at the end. STFT again shows energy at the lowest frequencies and SHAP has additional positive mass near the right edge (weaker than the trough). This recovery consolidates the trough\u2192rise pattern.\\n- Microstructure: across the important windows there are only small-amplitude high-frequency ripples (visible as faint higher-frequency STFT content). SHAP does not highlight these higher-frequency bins, so they play a minor supporting role only.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series-level description and temporal dependence:\\n- Global morphology: the series is dominated by very low-frequency, large amplitude oscillations (roughly two long half-cycles across 577 steps). The curve moves: initial high \u2192 smooth descent \u2192 early small bulge \u2192 deeper mid trough \u2192 steady rise to a high mid/late peak \u2192 steep descent to a large late trough \u2192 strong recovery to a high end value. Amplitude range \u2248 +1.7 down to \u2248 -2.0.\\n- Periodicity/time scale: no short repeating cycles; energy is concentrated at the bottom of the STFT (long timescale). The dominant pattern is an ordered sequence of broad crests and troughs (slow envelope), not rapid oscillations.\\n- Volatility: low overall. Most segments (crests and trough bottoms) are smooth with small micro-ripples confined to inflection points or tops of crests.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: the discriminative evidence arises from the ordered combination of low-frequency elements: an early bulge, a mid/late positive crest, a deep late trough, and the final recovery. In particular, the model heavily upweights (via SHAP) the deep late trough and the crest\u2192trough\u2192recovery sequence, indicating the classifier uses the temporal ordering and relative magnitudes of these envelope features rather than isolated instantaneous values.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature lists and provisional classification with similarity scores:\\n- Label 2 (minivan) match: High. Label-2 descriptions emphasize (a) an early front bulge, (b) a mid trough and mid rise to a moderate peak, (c) a dominant deep rear trough around t\u2248420\u2013480, and (d) a steep/steady recovery to a high terminal value \u2014 all concentrated in the lowest STFT band. Test sample 51 shows those same features (early bulge, mid-to-late peak, very deep late trough near t\u2248470 with strongest SHAP positive attribution, and final recovery). This is a strong one-to-one match. Score = 4.\\n- Label 1 (pickup) match: Moderate. Label-1 patterns emphasize trough\u2192sharp rebound pairs and strong low-frequency recoveries. Test sample has a large trough\u2192recovery, but label-1 typically highlights a pronounced mid-sequence trough and a distinctive fast rebound around t\u2248418\u2013475; the test sample\u2019s strongest diagnostic event is a very deep late trough paired with a preceding high crest and earlier bulge \u2014 while similar, the precise ordering and emphasis in label-1 differ. Score = 3.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) match: Low-to-moderate. Label-3 focuses on a long, high-amplitude midsection valley\u2192broad rise (mid shoulder) and a rounded peak in the mid-section (t\u2248110\u2013220 & t\u2248250\u2013280). Test 51 has a pronounced mid/late peak and a large trough later, but the label-3 descriptions put strongest SHAP weight on an earlier long ramp/shoulder (t\u2248110\u2013220). The test sample\u2019s dominant red attribution is at the late trough rather than that earlier ramp, so the match is weaker. Score = 2.\\n- Label 0 (sedan) match: Poor. Sedans are characterized by smoother, symmetric low-frequency lobes and emphasis on positive plateaus earlier and at the end, with less extreme negative troughs. The deep negative excursion (-2.0) in the test sample and the SHAP focus on that trough are not consistent with the sedan summary. Score = 1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and consistency check:\\n- The four 'similar' reference samples (samples 37, 32, 48, 35) are all labeled 2 in the reference set. Visually they are extremely similar to the test series: same arrangement of an early bulge, a mid rise/peak, a large late trough and a final recovery, and their SHAP heatmaps show bottom-row red aligned with the late trough and supporting earlier small bulges. That empirical match confirms the textual label-2 summary and supports assigning label 2 to the test sample.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' references (samples 51 and 18 in the dissimilar group) are labeled 3 and show different SHAP emphasis: their SHAP heatmaps do not put the strongest positive mass at the late trough location in the same way. Those differences corroborate that the test sample aligns more closely with the label-2 examples than with label-3 examples.\\n- Fairness and scoring logic: I scored label 2 as 4 (high similarity) because every major diagnostic element called out in the label-2 feature summary (deep late trough, low-frequency dominance, final recovery, early bulge / mid-crest structure) is present in the test sample and is where SHAP places positive attribution. Labels 1 and 3 receive lower scores because they share some but not the most diagnostic combination/order of features. Label 0 is the least similar.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 2 (minivan). The classifier\u2019s SHAP attribution and the test series\u2019 slow large-amplitude trough/crest/ recovery sequence strongly match the label-2 pattern; the reference training examples labeled 2 are visually and spectrally very similar to this test sample, validating the assignment.\"\n    ]\n}",
      "{\n    \"result\": [\"label 2\"],\n    \"score\": [4],\n    \"rationale\": [\n        \"Step 1 \u2014 Local feature / SHAP mapping:\\n- SHAP heatmap: the most consistent positive (red) attribution is concentrated in the lowest frequency row (very low-frequency band). The strongest red patch is centered around the time window ~440\u2013485 (peak redness \u2248471), with additional smaller red patches at low frequency earlier (~50\u2013110) and a moderate red band around ~300\u2013370. Higher frequency rows show little consistent red.\\n- Map to the time series plot (fine-grained):\\n  * Early region (~0\u2013110): signal starts high (~+1.7 to +1.8 at t\u22480) then descends smoothly to a local trough near t\u2248150\u2013180. The trough amplitude is about \u22121.0 to \u22121.3. Volatility here is low (smooth curvature) with only small high-frequency ripples (amplitude <<0.1). SHAP shows modest positive attribution at the bottom low-frequency band for portions of this descent/early trough (~50\u2013110), indicating the classifier treats the presence/timing of this early trough as supportive.\\n  * Mid region (~200\u2013320): a steady upward ramp from slightly negative through zero to a modest plateau / local peak around +0.4 to +0.8 (peak plateau between ~240\u2013320). The ramp is low-frequency, smooth, and contains small micro-bumps on the plateau. SHAP shows a moderate low-frequency red patch overlapping the later portion of this rise (~300\u2013360), i.e. the model rewards the sustained low-frequency positive plateau/ramp there.\\n  * Late region (\u2248360\u2013485): a large, long-duration descent from positive values into the global trough centered ~465\u2013475 with minimum \u2248 \u22122.0 to \u22122.1. This trough is broad and U-shaped (wide base), the descent and ascent are smooth (low volatility) but relatively steep compared with earlier ramps. The SHAP heatmap has its strongest red exactly aligned with this low-frequency, high-amplitude trough window (~440\u2013485). This indicates the model treats the presence, depth and width of that large low-frequency trough as strong positive evidence for the predicted class.\\n  * Terminal recovery (\u2248485\u2013576): after the deep trough the series rises steadily and monotonically to about +1.7\u2013+1.9 by the end. This is a smooth, nearly linear low-frequency recovery. The STFT bottom bin and SHAP also show positive attribution near the end (confirmatory evidence).\\n- Frequency support (STFT): the STFT image shows essentially all measurable energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin(s) throughout the sequence; brief local increases in very-low-frequency magnitude align with the large ramps/troughs above. There is negligible sustained mid/high-frequency energy, consistent with the SHAP emphasis on the lowest frequency band.\\n- Summary of local features used by the model: the classifier emphasizes slow, large-amplitude envelope features \u2014 especially the final deep trough and the subsequent long recovery \u2014 with secondary support from the early trough and the mid-sequence plateau.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features and temporal dependence:\\n- Global form: the series is dominated by very-low-frequency, long-wavelength oscillation with roughly two main half-cycles over 577 points: (1) early high \u2192 descent \u2192 local trough (~t=150\u2013180) \u2192 (2) mid rise / plateau (~t=200\u2013320) \u2192 (3) large descent to global trough (~t=420\u2013475) \u2192 (4) steady recovery to end (~t=480\u2013576).\\n- Volatility: low overall; the trace is smooth with only small micro-fluctuations at extrema and on plateaus. The largest changes are low-frequency slopes (not impulsive spikes).\\n- Rates & asymmetry: slopes differ by segment. The mid-rise is a moderate low-frequency ramp, the fall into the global trough is relatively steep (larger magnitude slope), and the final recovery is sustained and fairly steady. The deep final trough has the largest absolute amplitude (~\u22122.0) in the sample and is temporally the most salient feature.\\n- Feature combination & dependence: the classifier appears to exploit the sequence: an early trough + mid ramp/plateau + deep late trough + final recovery. In other words, it is not a single isolated point but the ordered pattern of low-frequency lobes (their amplitude, width and timing) that matters. The STFT + SHAP indicate evidence is carried in the lowest-frequency band across those time windows.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and selection:\\n- Compare to label_2 (minivan): The label_2 pattern repeatedly emphasizes: dominant very-low-frequency envelope; early moderate crest and mid troughs; a mid/central rise to a plateau; a pronounced, wide, deep rear trough around t\u2248420\u2013480 (amplitude down to \u2248 \u22121.7 to \u22121.9) and then a strong recovery to a high positive terminal value. That description aligns closely (nearly point-by-point) with the sample: the deep trough near ~470 (\u22122.0), the mid plateau, and the terminal recovery are all present and are the primary SHAP-attributed regions. The STFT/SHAP signatures (bottom-frequency energy concentrating on those windows) also match label_2 descriptions.\\n- Compare to label_1 (pickup): label_1 focuses on a pronounced trough \u2192 sharp rebound mid-sequence (often strong positive attribution around the rebound) and long recoveries. While our sample does contain trough\u2192recovery behavior, the specific structure (timing, amplitude proportions and where the strongest positive attribution is placed) more closely matches the minivan templates. The pickup descriptions often stress a steep midrise as the dominant cue; our sample\u2019s most dominant cue is the late deep trough + recovery, not a mid-sequence steep ascent of the pickup type.\\n- Compare to label_3 (SUV): label_3 emphasizes a pronounced, broad mid-rise/shoulder in the mid-section (t\u2248110\u2013220) as the strongest positive cue, with the deep trough sometimes treated as neutral. Our sample does have a mid rise, but the SHAP's strongest positive area and the visually dominant feature is the late deep trough and recovery, which is more diagnostic of label_2 in the reference summaries. Also SUV reference samples show the main red attribution concentrated on the long mid-rise/shoulder rather than the late trough.\\n- Compare to label_0 (sedan): label_0 focuses on smoother low-frequency lobes but tends to emphasize positive plateaus earlier and shallow troughs; typical sedan examples have different timing/amplitude structure and less extreme late trough amplitude than observed here.\\n- Quantified similarity (internal check before final decision \u2014 per-label rough scores):\\n  * label 0 (sedan): 2 (low similarity \u2014 some low-frequency lobes match but amplitude/timing differ)\\n  * label 1 (pickup): 2 (low similarity \u2014 contains trough\u2192recovery but not the pickup\u2019s characteristic midrise/rebound prominence)\\n  * label 2 (minivan): 4 (high similarity \u2014 multiple defining elements match: early/mid lobes, deep wide trough near t\u2248420\u2013480, and terminal recovery; SHAP and STFT also align)\\n  * label 3 (SUV): 2 (low similarity \u2014 SUV emphasizes a broad mid-rise/shoulder that is the main positive cue; here the dominant SHAP is on the late trough instead)\\n- Therefore the best match is label_2 (minivan). I assign highest similarity (4) to label_2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples:\\n- The four similar reference samples provided (Samples 37, 32, 48, 35) are all labelled 2 and their plots are visually very close to the test series: same early descent to a shallow mid trough, then a mid rise/plateau, then a large deep trough around the 420\u2013480 window and a strong recovery to the end. Their STFTs also concentrate energy in the lowest bin and their SHAP maps show red concentrated at low frequency in the same windows \u2014 exactly mirroring the test sample\u2019s STFT and SHAP. This strongly confirms the classification.\\n- The two dissimilar samples (label 3 references) show different SHAP emphasis (mid-rise) and somewhat different distribution of amplitudes/timings; they do not match the test sample\u2019s primary high-importance window (the deep trough at ~470). That confirms the test sample is unlikely to be label 3.\\n\\nFinal decision and confidence:\\n- Based on the local attributions (SHAP), the mapped time-domain manifestations (deep wide trough ~440\u2013485, terminal recovery, mid plateau), the STFT concentration at the lowest frequency, and the strong agreement with multiple label_2 reference samples, I classify the test sample as label 2 (minivan).\\n- Similarity score for label_2: 4 (high similarity).\"\n    ]\n}"

      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 1\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local (red-SHAP) feature description: The SHAP heatmap shows the strongest positive attribution concentrated in the lowest-frequency row at several well-separated time windows. Mapping those red windows to the time trace gives the following precise local features: (a) Early trough (approx t \u2248 70\u2013130): amplitude falls from \u2248 +1.4 at the start to a local minimum \u2248 -1.05\u2026-1.2 around t\u2248100\u2013120. The descent is smooth, low-volatility (very few sharp spikes), average slope \u2248 -0.015 to -0.02 units/step, with tiny high-frequency ripples (amplitude \u2248 0.01\u20130.05) on the trough flank. STFT: energy concentrated at the very lowest frequencies in this interval. (b) Mid-sequence steep ascent/peak (approx t \u2248 200\u2013320): the series climbs from slightly negative values through zero to a rounded peak \u2248 +1.3\u2026+1.5 around t\u2248270\u2013320. This rise is one of the steepest low-frequency ramps in the record (average slope \u2248 +0.02\u2013+0.035 units/step), shows a short plateau/shoulder near the crest and only small micro\u2011fluctuations on the top. SHAP red strongly covers the low-frequency band here. (c) Large descent to global trough (approx t \u2248 320\u2013420): after the peak the trace falls fairly steeply to the global minimum \u2248 -1.45\u2026-1.6 near t\u2248410\u2013420. The fall is smooth and low-volatility; STFT again shows dominant low-frequency energy. SHAP still highlights parts of the low-frequency band around this transition (positive attribution on portions of the falling/recovery cycle). (d) Long recovery to end (approx t \u2248 420\u2013576): a sustained low-frequency recovery from the global trough back up to a late plateau \u2248 +1.4\u2026+1.5 at the series end. The climb is steady (avg slope \u2248 +0.02\u2013+0.03), low volatility, and the SHAP map shows positive low-frequency attribution aligned with this recovery and the terminal high. In all red windows the STFT confirms energy concentrated at the bottom frequency bins (very low-frequency/long-timescale features); the small high-frequency ripples at extrema are visible in the STFT as very weak higher\u2011bin energy but are not strongly attributed by SHAP. These local descriptions are unambiguous: long low\u2011frequency lobes (deep troughs and broad peaks), steep but smooth slopes between lobes, and small amplitude micro\u2011ripples at extrema.\"\n    ,\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and dependence: The sample is dominated by very-low-frequency structure (two main/one-and-a-half long oscillatory cycles across 577 steps) and low short-term volatility except for tiny ripples at extrema. Sequence-level shape: initial positive baseline \u2192 smooth descent to an early trough (~t\u2248100) \u2192 strong low\u2011frequency ascent to a large mid peak (~t\u2248260\u2013320) \u2192 steep descent to the global trough (~t\u2248410) \u2192 sustained recovery and final positive plateau (~t\u2248520\u2013576). The STFT is consistent with this: almost all measurable energy sits in the lowest frequency band, with localized increases at times of the large amplitude half-cycles. Temporal dependence matters: the classifier appears to use the ordered pattern trough \u2192 rapid rise \u2192 peak \u2192 descent \u2192 deep trough \u2192 long recovery as a coherent multi-stage signature; isolated instantaneous spikes are not present and would be less informative. Overall volatility is low, slopes are smooth but asymmetric (the mid-rise is relatively steep, the fall into the global trough is steeper in places), and the waveform envelope is the primary discriminative object.\"\n    ,\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label summaries (coarse scoring and selection): Comparing the observed local and global features to the provided label feature sets: - Label 1 (pickup): its description emphasizes exactly the combination we see \u2014 a prominent mid/early trough followed by a pronounced, relatively fast low-frequency ascent to a high mid-peak, then descent to a deep global trough and a long recovery to a final high. SHAP in the label-1 examples is focused on the trough\u2192rise and final recovery low-frequency bands. The test sample matches these points closely (timing of troughs/rises, low-frequency dominance, SHAP red alignment). I rate similarity = 4 (high). - Label 0 (sedan): also describes dominant low\u2011frequency lobes, positive plateaus and troughs, and SHAP emphasis on low-frequency plateaus. The sample shares many broad envelope features with sedans (low-frequency lobes, final plateau), but the label-0 summaries emphasized sustained positive plateaus as the strongest positive cues (and sometimes treated very deep negative excursions as neutral). Our sample\u2019s strongest discriminative events are the trough\u2192sharp mid-rise and the large recovery \u2014 a pattern more explicitly called out for pickups. I rate similarity = 3 (moderate). - Label 2 (minivan): descriptions put the strongest positive weight on a large late deep trough plus a strong terminal rise; some minivan examples also show multiple crests/troughs across the series. Our sample does include a deep late trough and terminal recovery, so there is overlap, but minivan SHAP patterns often concentrate most positive mass specifically on the deep trough (and sometimes penalize certain mid peaks). Because our sample\u2019s SHAP positive mass is distributed across trough\u2192rise events (especially the mid rise and final recovery), similarity = 3 (moderate). - Label 3 (SUV): the SUV pattern emphasizes a long mid-segment valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded shoulder as the main positive cue. The test sample has a mid rise and rounded peak, but the SUV descriptions often emphasize a prominent long rising shoulder as the single most diagnostic component, whereas our series places more diagnostic weight on the paired trough\u2192rebound cycles. Thus similarity = 2 (low\u2013moderate). The single best match is label 1 (pickup) based on the alignment of (i) SHAP red localization to trough\u2192rise and final recovery low-frequency bands, (ii) the timing/amplitude/asymmetry of slopes, and (iii) the overall envelope morphology.\"\n    ,\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification: The two most similar training references provided (Samples 45 and 31, both label 1) show extremely similar waveforms: initial high \u2192 early trough near t\u2248100 \u2192 strong mid rise to \u2248+1.4\u2026+1.6 around t\u2248260\u2013320 \u2192 descent to a deep trough around t\u2248410\u2013430 \u2192 final recovery to a high plateau. Their SHAP heatmaps concentrate positive mass in the same low-frequency windows (midrise and final recovery). Sample 57\u2019s shape, amplitudes, slope magnitudes, STFT low\u2011frequency dominance, and SHAP low-band red patches match those label\u20111 references closely (visual and quantitative features align). The label\u20110 and label\u20112 reference examples also share low-frequency lobes and deep troughs but differ in where the classifier assigns the strongest positive SHAP mass (sedan favors sustained positive plateaus; minivan concentrates more on a single dominant deep trough). Dissimilar samples (the provided label\u20112 dissimilar examples) show more irregular multi-peaked structure or different SHAP distributions; those are less consistent with sample 57. After rechecking shapes, STFT, SHAP alignment, and comparing to the provided reference examples, the most consistent classification is label 1 (pickup). Final similarity scores per label (1\u20134): label 0 = 3, label 1 = 4, label 2 = 3, label 3 = 2. Conclusion: classify Sample 57 as label 1 (pickup).\"\n  ]\n}",

The late trough-to-recovery pair is the largest amplitude event in the sequence.\\n- Asymmetry and slopes: rises and falls are asymmetric \u2014 the mid-section rise (110\u2013220) is long and steady; the fall into the global trough (360\u2013420) is steeper; the recovery from the global trough is sustained and strong. Microstructure (small bumps and shoulders) occurs mainly at peaks/plateaus and around the mid spike (~300\u2013315) but is secondary to the envelope.\\n- Relationship of features: the mid-section broad rise/shoulder (110\u2013220) followed by a brief correction and local spike (~260\u2013315) sets up the later deep fall \u2014 the timing and amplitude of these low-frequency features form a composite silhouette. The STFT peak around the trough indicates that the deep negative lobe is the single largest energy event and will be very influential for any classifier that attends to low-frequency amplitude.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match against provided label feature summaries (qualitative matching and initial similarity scoring):\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary: emphasizes a pronounced smooth upward ramp ~110\u2013220 with shoulder/rounded top, then a short correction/spike, and later a deep trough ~366\u2013420 followed by recovery. This sample shows all these elements: (1) valley near ~100, (2) long upward ramp with shoulder near 110\u2013220, (3) brief correction and spike ~260\u2013315, (4) steep descent to a deep trough ~410\u2013420, (5) later recovery to a positive plateau. STFT and amplitude magnitudes align with label 3 description. => High similarity.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary: emphasizes a multi-crest/trough envelope with a dominant deep rear trough ~420 and a strong recovery to the end; also notes low-frequency dominance and a mid positive crest ~300. Our sample matches many of these (dominant deep trough at ~420, mid crest near ~300, final recovery). However label 2 descriptions place the deepest positive attribution on the late trough specifically and describe the trough amplitude as the primary cue; while our mid rise/shoulder (110\u2013220) is also prominent and is a stronger match to label 3's emphasis. => Moderate-to-high similarity.\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary: stresses trough-to-sharp-rebound patterns, especially a strongly attributed recovery around ~418\u2013475, and steep mid rises ~200\u2013280. Our sample has a strong recovery after the deep trough and has mid rises, but pickup descriptions often emphasize the rebound as the main cue (and earlier mid trough timing differs). Our sample has both rebound and pronounced mid-rise; pickup is a reasonable match but the prominent long mid-rise shoulder (110\u2013220) which label 3 highlights is more characteristic of SUV. => Moderate similarity.\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary: emphasizes dominant very-low-frequency oscillation with broad positive plateaus at the end and two smooth troughs that are less extreme. Sedans in the description have less extreme deep troughs and more reward for sustained positive plateaus; our sample has an extreme deep trough (\u2248-2.2) which sedan summary often treats as neutral or slightly negative. The mid-rise patterns and extreme trough magnitude make sedan a weaker match. => Low similarity.\\nInitial similarity scores (1\u20134): label0 = 2, label1 = 3, label2 = 3, label3 = 4.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with the provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- Visual comparison: the provided similar reference Sample 1 (Sample 51, Label 3) is visually very close to our sample: same early trough ~100, long ramp/shoulder ~110\u2013220, small mid spike, a deep trough around 400\u2013430 and a recovery to a high positive end. The time locations and amplitudes align closely. That strongly supports label 3.\\n- Other similar references: samples labelled 1 and 2 also share some elements (deep trough + recovery, mid crest), which explains why the retrieval returned mixed labels. However the particular combination valley\u2192long shoulder/ramp (110\u2013220) \u2192 short spike \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery is described almost verbatim in label 3's feature list and reference sample 51. Label 2 references emphasize the deep trough but less the long mid rising shoulder as the primary cue; label 1 references emphasize the rebound as the main cue but their mid-rise timing and slope differences are slightly different.\\n- Fairness & scoring logic: because the sample contains the exact ordered sequence of sub-events that label 3's description calls out as the primary discriminative motif (long valley\u2192broad rise/shoulder at ~110\u2013220, small spike/correction, then steep fall to a very deep trough and final recovery), label 3 is the best single-match. The STFT and amplitude magnitudes corroborate that the mid-rise and trough events are low-frequency and high-magnitude as described for label 3. The scores assigned earlier reflect per-label closeness: label 3 highest (4), label 2 and 1 moderate (3) because they each share major features (deep trough & rebound / trough\u2192recovery) but not the full ordered motif emphasis, and label 0 lower (2) because key characteristics (lack of extreme trough, emphasis on different plateaus) do not match well.\\n\\nConclusion (final output rationale): The sample should be classified as label 3 (SUV). Confidence / similarity score for the chosen label: 4 (high similarity). Per-label similarity motivation: label 3 best matches the ordered, high-amplitude, low-frequency motif (valley\u2192broad mid-rise/shoulder\u2192short spike\u2192deep trough\u2192strong recovery). Labels 1 and 2 share important sub-features (deep trough and rebound / mid crest) so they receive moderate similarity; label 0 (sedan) is the least similar of the four.\\n\\nPer the requested format, the final decision is label 3 with score 4.\"\n    ]\n}",

Amplitude change is large (~1.8\u20132.0 units from nearby trough to crest), the slope is steady (moderate positive first derivative across ~60\u201370 steps), volatility is low (only tiny micro-ripples of a few hundredths). STFT shows energy concentrated at the bottom frequency bins in this time window, confirming the ramp is a slow (low-frequency) shape change. The red SHAP here indicates this long, high-amplitude rise is being counted as strong positive evidence.\\n- Secondary red area \u2014 approx. t \u2248 240\u2013320 (low frequency): This corresponds to the crest/plateau and a brief small dip/recover substructure around ~260\u2013300. The trace shows a rounded peak with a small shoulder and small-amplitude irregularities on top; STFT again concentrates energy at the lowest frequencies (very little mid/high frequency). SHAP red across this region indicates the rounded peak + shoulder subshape is also positive for the classifier.\\n- Tertiary red patch \u2014 approx. t \u2248 360\u2013420 (low frequency): On the trace this aligns with the steep descent into the global trough and the trough region itself (the curve falls to the sample's most negative values near -2.1\u2026-2.3 around ~400\u2013420). Although the trough amplitude is large and STFT energy is high at the lowest band here, the SHAP signal in this zone is mixed but still shows positive low-frequency attribution in adjacent bins (the heatmap shows some red in low band across this interval). The trough is smooth, long-duration (dozens of steps), and the descent/ascent around it are relatively steep compared with the earlier ramp.\\n- Minor SHAP structure: small blue (negative) patches appear later (~470) that correspond to a short local dip after the big recovery; those local high-frequency-ish dips are small in amplitude and short in duration and produce negative or neutral local attribution. Overall the SHAP emphasis is on slow (lowest-frequency) components at these mid-to-late time windows.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series-level description and feature combination / temporal dependence:\\n- Global morphology: The series is dominated by very low-frequency, long-timescale envelope structure (STFT concentrated at the bottom rows). There are roughly two long oscillatory half-cycles across the 577 points: an early descent (from start) into a broad trough near t\u2248100, a long and strong low-frequency rise to a broad rounded plateau/shoulder around t\u2248150\u2013320, then a steep large-magnitude fall to the global trough near t\u2248400, followed by a strong recovery and a high positive level at the end (t\u2248520\u2013576). Amplitudes are large (peaks up to \u2248+1.6\u2026+1.8; troughs down to \u2248-2.1\u2026-2.3).\\n- Volatility and rates of change: Volatility is low on plateaus and ramps (small micro-ripples), higher only at the steep descents/ascents (not wide-band noise, rather larger first-derivative magnitudes). The early-to-mid rise is smoother and lower-frequency than the later descent into the deepest trough, which is steeper. The final recovery is also relatively steep and sustained.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: The classifier appears to use the ordered sequence valley \u2192 long, slow, high-amplitude rise \u2192 rounded peak/shoulder \u2192 sharp descent to deep trough \u2192 sustained rebound as a composite signature. The SHAP map confirms the model weights low-frequency energy in the mid-rise and surrounding plateau/shoulder most positively, with supporting positive attribution for the trough/recovery sequence.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists and preliminary scoring:\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary emphasizes a long, high-amplitude low-frequency upward ramp around t\u2248110\u2013220, a rounded peak/shoulder there, and then a later deep trough and recovery; SHAP-red areas in this sample line up strongly with precisely that mid-section ramp/shoulder. The sample\u2019s dominant mid-rise + rounded peak motif and the global timing of the deep trough/recovery correspond closely to the label-3 description. Preliminary similarity: High (score = 4).\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary emphasizes deep troughs followed by strong recoveries and steep mid-sequence ascents; the sample does have a deep trough and final recovery and also shows steep pieces. However pickup descriptions focus more on the trough\u2192rapid rebound as the primary hallmark (and earlier trough timing matters). Our sample\u2019s strongest positive attribution is the long mid-rise/shoulder rather than exclusively the trough-to-recovery pair. Preliminary similarity: Moderate (score = 3).\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary highlights multiple broad crests/troughs and especially a pronounced late deep trough plus final rise; the late deep trough and final recovery here are consistent with minivan patterns too, and some red SHAP appears over the deep trough. But minivan summaries place greatest positive weight on the trough as the dominant discriminative event; in our sample the classifier\u2019s greatest SHAP emphasis is the mid-rise/shoulder (favoring SUV). Preliminary similarity: Moderate (score = 3).\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary emphasizes dominant low-frequency oscillation with positive plateaus in mid/end and smaller troughs; some parts of the curve (the positive plateaus toward the end and the mid positive region) superficially match sedan features, but sedans in the summary are described as smoother, less extreme in trough depth, and with different timing emphasis. Our sample\u2019s very deep trough (~-2.2) and very strong mid-rise shoulder match label 3 better than label 0. Preliminary similarity: Low (score = 2).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference examples and final decision reasoning:\\n- Similar reference sample 1 (Sample 51, label 3) is visually and spectrally very close: it shows the same valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded peak\u2192deep trough\u2192recovery sequence, and its SHAP emphasis is concentrated on the mid-rise/shoulder low-frequency band. That close match strongly supports assigning label 3.\\n- Other similar references (Samples 34 and 28, label 2) share the deep trough + recovery motif but their SHAP emphasis is more distributed over trough-related low-frequency bins; our sample\u2019s SHAP peak is concentrated earlier (mid-rise/shoulder) which aligns better with the label-3 pattern.\\n- Similar sample 39 (label 1) has some overlapping traits (steep ascents and deep troughs) but the canonical pickup description centers on particular trough\u2192rebound timing that differs from our sample\u2019s strongest SHAP region. Dissimilar references (Samples 11 and 4 labelled as 1 in the dissimilar set) show different distributed/noisier SHAP or different midsection shapes compared with our sample.\\n- Summarizing consistency: the sample\u2019s strongest SHAP attribution, the exact timing and morphology of the mid-section long ramp + rounded shoulder, and the global order of extrema match the label-3 (SUV) pattern almost exactly and also correspond closely to the provided label-3 reference (Sample 51). The deep trough and recovery are present and consistent with multiple classes, but they are secondary to the model\u2019s mid-rise attribution here.\\n\\nFinal classification and similarity scores (per-label):\\n- Final predicted label: label 3 (SUV). Confidence / similarity score for this label: 4 (high similarity).\\n- Per-label similarity summary used in reasoning (for transparency): label 0 = 2, label 1 = 3, label 2 = 3, label 3 = 4.\\n\\nConclusion: Given the dominant low-frequency mid-section ramp/rounded shoulder that the SHAP map highlights, the close match to the label-3 reference patterns, and the overall envelope/timing of extrema, the most accurate class for Test Sample 4 is label 3 (SUV).\"\n  ]\n}",

Preliminary similarity score: 3.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Crosschecking against reference samples and final decision:\\n  - The provided \u2018similar\u2019 reference samples include three labeled 0 and one labeled 3. The three label\u20110 reference traces (samples 42, 6 [shown as similar 2], and 20) show almost the same timing of trough (~80\u2013130), mid plateau (~260\u2013280), deep trough (~410\u2013430) and final recovery, and their STFTs show the same low\u2011frequency concentration. The visual alignment between those label\u20110 examples and the test sample is extremely close (match in amplitude, timing, low volatility, and substructure). The label\u20113 example (sample 33) is also similar but differences are more subtle; the strongest alignment across timing and amplitude occurs with the label\u20110 references.\\n  - The two dissimilar examples (label 2) contain additional small peaks, different mid\u2011segment structure and a different envelope; they do not match our sample as well.\\n  - Based on the near\u2011perfect correspondence in event timing, amplitude levels, low\u2011frequency dominance and low micro\u2011volatility to the label\u20110 description and the label\u20110 reference plots, the correct classification is label 0 (sedan).\\n\\nFinal per\u2011label similarity scores (1\u20134):\\n  - label 0 (sedan): 4 (high similarity \u2014 near one\u2011to\u2011one match in timing/amplitude/shape)\\n  - label 1 (pickup): 2 (low similarity \u2014 some overlapping motifs but key timing/shapes differ)\\n  - label 2 (minivan): 1 (no/very weak similarity \u2014 distinct pattern differences)\\n  - label 3 (SUV): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 shares mid\u2011rise/rounded peak but less exact than label 0)\\n\\nConclusion: The sample is classified as label 0 (sedan) with high confidence (score = 4). The decision is supported by precise alignment of trough/peak timing, amplitudes and low\u2011frequency envelope with the sedan feature summary and multiple label\u20110 reference samples.\"\n  ]\n}",

Test sample 7 matches this description closely in timing, amplitude and shape (first trough ~100, mid-peak ~260, deep trough ~420, final plateau ~end). The STFT low-frequency dominance and SHAP-like positive attribution windows described for label 0 correspond very well to the observed STFT and time-series events. => High similarity.\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary features: also emphasizes deep trough(s) and strong trough\u2192rebound transitions (notably a strong recovery around 418\u2013475) and large low-frequency half-cycles. Test sample contains a steep rebound after the deep trough and a strong midrise too, so there is moderate overlap: the trough\u2192recovery motif and low-frequency dominance are shared. But label 1 descriptions emphasize an especially diagnostic mid-sequence rebound timing and somewhat different relative attributions (mid-rebound being strongest). Our sample's mid-peak and final plateau timing and relative shapes align a bit more with label 0's pattern. => Moderate similarity.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary features: slow low-frequency structure with a characteristic large rear trough and some mid-sequence protrusions and a sharper short localized protrusion around t\u2248310. While test sample has a deep rear trough, it lacks the specific mid-sequence small protrusion patterns and the earlier front bulge signature emphasized for minivan; also minivan examples emphasize somewhat different balancing of SHAP attributions (deep trough is important but combined with front/mid bulges). Overall, only partial overlap (deep trough + recovery) but missing several minivan-specific substructures. => Low similarity.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary features: strong long low-frequency upward ramp / shoulder around t\u2248110\u2013220 culminating in a rounded peak/shoulder (large positive amplitude) is a key discriminative cue. Test sample does have a strong valley\u2192broad rise and a rounded mid-peak around 200\u2013280, which is consistent with the SUV description; however SUV descriptions also include a characteristic post-peak spike and different attribution to the later deep trough (often neutral/negative).

Dissimilar label 2 example has extra small-scale peaks and different mid-section structure not present in the test sample.\\n- Scoring logic and fairness: Given (a) near-exact match of the ordered low-frequency lobes, (b) same amplitudes and low volatility, and (c) STFT agreement, label 0 is the most consistent classification. Label 1 and 3 share some features (so are given moderate similarity), while label 2 shares the deep trough but lacks other hallmark features, so it gets a lower similarity.\\n\\nPer-label similarity summary (1\u20134 scale):\\n- label 0 (sedan): 4 (high similarity \u2014 near one-to-one match with label-0 feature pattern and reference sample 1)\\n- label 1 (pickup): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 shares trough\u2192rebound and low-frequency energy but timing/relative emphasis differ)\\n- label 2 (minivan): 2 (low similarity \u2014 shares deep trough but lacks mid-sequence protrusion/front-bulge cues)\\n- label 3 (SUV): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 shares the long low-frequency mid-rise/shoulder but the full two-cycle envelope matches label 0 better)\\n\\nFinal classification decision after verification: label 0 (sedan) with high confidence.

I map those red windows to the time-series plot and describe the exact local structure seen there.\\n  1) Early window (approx. t \u2248 40\u201375): the trace has a local positive crest centered ~50\u201365 with amplitude about +1.2 to +1.5. This crest sits on a descending background (the series falls from the start value ~+1.7 into this region). The crest is broad (tens of steps), smooth and low-volatility (small micro\u2011ripples on the top). STFT energy is concentrated at the lowest frequency bin here, consistent with a slow envelope feature. SHAP red here implies the model treats this early bulge as positive evidence.\\n  2) Mid window (approx. t \u2248 220\u2013300): there is a steady low-frequency upward ramp from slightly negative values through zero into a modest plateau/peak around +0.4\u2013+0.6 (peak near ~260). The ramp is smooth with low volatility and small high-frequency bumps on the plateau. STFT again shows energy in the bottom bins. SHAP red in this interval indicates the classifier credits this slow recovery/rise as supportive evidence.\\n  3) Pre-large-peak window (approx. t \u2248 330\u2013370): the series climbs from near-zero/positive to a pronounced high peak around +1.6\u2013+1.7 (center ~350). The rise is relatively steep but still a low-frequency, broad shape (not a narrow spike); volatility on the rising limb is low, with only small micro\u2011fluctuations. The STFT bottom band increases in magnitude here. The SHAP red focused at the lowest frequency implies this large positive lobe is a discriminative slow-shape cue.\\n  4) Late trough & recovery window (approx. t \u2248 430\u2013520, strongest around 460\u2013490): the trace falls steeply from the mid/high region down to the global minimum (~ -2.0 around t\u2248470) and then performs a long, smooth recovery up to ~+1.7 at the end. The trough is deep, wide and very smooth (low short-term volatility); the recovery is a sustained low-frequency upslope. The STFT shows strong energy at the lowest frequency during the trough and the recovery. SHAP red over this low-frequency band here indicates the model regards the deep trough followed by the long rebound as strong positive evidence for the target class.\\n- Frequency support: The STFT confirms almost all relevant power is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins throughout the red windows; higher-frequency content is negligible except for tiny ripples at extrema. This corroborates that the SHAP-positive features are slow (low-frequency) envelope shapes (broad crests/troughs and long ramps) rather than transient spikes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and temporal composition:\\n- Global shape and periodicity: The series is dominated by long-wavelength oscillatory structure (roughly two large half-cycles across the 577 steps). There is an initial high value followed by a broad descent to an early trough, then a modest mid recovery/plateau, then a large positive peak, then a steep descent into the deepest trough, and finally a sustained recovery to a high endpoint. This ordering (crest \u2192 trough \u2192 mid-rise \u2192 large crest \u2192 deep trough \u2192 final recovery) is clear and time-dependent.\\n- Amplitude & volatility: Extreme values span roughly +1.7 (peaks) down to about -2.0 (global trough). Volatility is low across plateaus and trough bottoms; the highest rates of change occur on the steep descent into the global trough and the subsequent long recovery. Micro-scale fluctuations (amplitude << 0.2) appear mainly at extrema and do not dominate the signal.\\n- Combination and dependence: The discriminative evidence is concentrated in the timing and magnitude of the large low-frequency features: the early bulge, the mid ramp/plateau, the large central peak, and especially the late deep trough with its long recovery. The features form a coherent temporal sequence \u2014 the presence of the deep late trough paired with a prior large crest and a sustained end-rise is a composite signature that the classifier uses (SHAP consistently lights the low-frequency band at these critical times).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature sets and scoring (per provided summaries):\\n- Label 2 (minivan) match: High. The label_2 description emphasizes: multiple broad crests/troughs, a dominant deep trough around the mid-late window (~t\u2248420\u2013470) with amplitude near -1.7 to -1.9, and a final strong recovery to a high positive endpoint \u2014 exactly what we observe in this sample. The STFT/SHAP patterns (low-frequency red at the deep trough and end recovery, plus red at earlier crests) match the minivan signatures in the reference summaries and the two similar label_2 reference samples. I therefore assign label_2 the highest match. Similarity score to label_2: 4 (high similarity).\\n- Label 1 (pickup) match: Moderate. Pickup summaries stress a pronounced trough\u2192sharp recovery half-cycle (mid-sequence) and strong rebounds; our sample does have big troughs and recoveries. However, pickup descriptions emphasize an earlier steep mid-sequence rebound that is the main diagnostic event; in this sample the most diagnostic events (per SHAP and amplitude) are the late deep trough and sustained recovery combined with earlier crests \u2014 a pattern more consistent with minivan than the asymmetric steep-mid rebound signature described for pickups. Similarity score to label_1: 3 (moderate).\\n- Label 0 (sedan) match: Low-to-moderate. Sedan patterns focus on broad low-frequency lobes and sustained positive plateaus at specific mid/end windows, but the sedans described typically have less extreme negative troughs and different timing/shape emphasis (positive plateaus are the strongest evidence). Our sample contains very deep negative troughs (\u2248 -2.0) which are more aligned with minivan/pickup classes; SHAP attribution also centers on troughs and rebounds rather than the sedan-specific plateau motifs. Similarity score to label_0: 2 (low similarity).\\n- Label 3 (SUV) match: Low. SUV descriptions emphasize a long, smooth, large-amplitude upward ramp in the mid-section (a valley\u2192broad shoulder\u2192rounded peak) as the principal cue. While our sample has a mid-to-late large peak, the most salient diagnostic event here is the deep trough + recovery, and the mid ramp is smaller in magnitude relative to the trough. The dissimilar reference SUV examples emphasize different mid-section shapes and different SHAP patterns. Similarity score to label_3: 1 (no/low similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- The two most similar training references provided (Samples 48 and 37) are both labeled 2 and show nearly identical large-scale structure: early crest, mid modest plateau, large crest around ~350, deep trough near ~430\u2013470, then strong recovery to high endpoint. Their STFTs and SHAP maps show low-frequency attribution concentrated at the trough and end recovery \u2014 the same layout seen in our sample. The similarity is strong in amplitude, timing of extrema, low-frequency dominance and SHAP attribution locations.\\n- The two references labeled 0 (Samples 10 and 3) share some broad low-frequency structure but differ in where SHAP concentrates and in trough depth (their troughs are typically shallower or the SHAP emphasis differs). The dissimilar SUV example (Sample 51) and its SHAP emphasize a long mid-section rise as the main cue \u2014 not the late deep trough/rebound pair that drives this sample \u2014 so those dissimilar examples strengthen the minivan assignment by contrast.\\n- Consistency check: the SHAP heatmap for this sample highlights the very same time regions and the lowest frequency band that the label_2 summary and the label_2 reference samples identify as the decisive cues. The trough amplitude, width, smoothness and the long recovery are all within the ranges cited for minivan examples. Therefore the classification is robust.\\n\\nConclusion: The sample's dominant, low-frequency large-amplitude structure (notably the deep mid-late trough around t~460\u2013480 combined with earlier crests and a sustained end rise), and the SHAP localization at those trough/recovery windows, match the label_2 (minivan) pattern very closely. I assign label_2 with a high similarity score of 4.\"\n    ]\n}",

The SHAP red here implies this early high\u2192broad trough structure is regarded as positive evidence.\",\n    \"   * Mid/central rise (~t 200\u2013320): after the early trough the series ramps upward through zero to a modest mid-peak around +0.4\u2026+0.6 (peaking roughly between t\u2248240\u2013280) with small superimposed micro-fluctuations on the rising flank and top. The rise is smooth (low-frequency), rate of change moderate. STFT again shows power in the bottom frequency band during this ramp. Local SHAP red in this window indicates the model rewards this sustained low-frequency rise/plateau.\",\n    \"   * Deep rear trough (~t 380\u2013480, strongest at \u2248470): the series then undergoes a long, steep descent to the global minimum (~-2.0 at \u2248470). This trough is the largest-amplitude, longest-duration negative excursion in the record (amplitude from preceding peak to trough \u2248 2.5 units). The descent and ascent around this trough are smooth (low volatility), and micro-ripples are small compared with the magnitude. The STFT shows the largest low-frequency magnitude here and SHAP shows the most intense red mass at the lowest-frequency row overlapping this trough and its immediate recovery \u2014 indicating the model treats this deep, broad negative valley (and the following recovery) as primary positive evidence.\",\n    \"   * Terminal recovery (~t 480\u2013576): after the global trough the series rises monotonically and rather steeply back to a high positive plateau (~+1.6\u2026+1.8) at the end. This sustained final rise/plateau is low-volatility, long-duration and again concentrated in the bottom STFT bin. SHAP red near the end confirms the model also weights this recovery/terminal plateau positively.\",\n    \" - Frequency/substructure summary for the red regions: STFT confirms almost all discriminative energy is at the very lowest frequencies (long-wavelength envelope).

Shorter, low-amplitude ripples appear at extrema but are minor.\",\n    \" - Rates of change: the steepest downward slope leads into the global trough (~t\u2248360\u2013470 region), and the recovery after the trough is a steady, substantial positive slope. The mid-rise is gentler than the largest descent but still sustained over many steps.\",\n    \" - Temporal dependence / combination: the classifier\u2019s SHAP attribution highlights the importance of the ordered sequence trough \u2192 sustained rise \u2192 deep trough \u2192 long recovery. In other words, the relative timing (early trough, mid rise, deep late trough, terminal rise) and the amplitude relationships between those lobes are the composite signature the model uses.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Compare to label feature summaries and select best-matching label:\",\n    \" - Label 2 (minivan) summary (from provided descriptions) emphasizes: an early front-region bulge and descent; a broad mid trough around t\u224880\u2013170; a smooth central rise/plateau (t\u2248200\u2013320) including a sharper local protrusion; a dominant deep rear trough around t\u2248420\u2013480 (the strongest positive SHAP region for minivan) and a strong final recovery to a high end value.

In our sample the mid-rise is present but is not as dominant/steep as the pickup archetype; the defining element here is the very deep rear trough + terminal recovery which is more characteristic of label 2.\",\n    \"   * Label 0 (sedan) focuses on broad low-frequency lobes with positive plateaus earlier and generally smaller or less deep negative excursions; the deep trough magnitude here (~-2.0) and the particular mid/late timing match label 2 better than label 0.\",\n    \"   * Label 3 (SUV) descriptions stress a long, high-amplitude upward shoulder in the mid-section as the main positive cue; while sample 9 has a mid-rise, the dominant positive SHAP concentration and the deepest trough timing align with minivan rather than the SUV mid-shoulder motif.\",\n    \" - Conclusion for Step 3: Label 2 (minivan) is the highest-match label.

The STFTs for those references also concentrate energy in the lowest bins at the same time windows and their SHAP maps show red on the same low-frequency rows at comparable time indices.

These red patches are almost exclusively in the lowest STFT bin, indicating the model attributes slowly varying, long-timescale shape features in those windows.\",\n    \"\u2022 Corresponding time-series manifestations (fine-grained):\",\n    \"  - Early interval (t \u2248 0\u2013120): the trace falls from an initial high (~+1.6) down through zero to a local trough near t \u2248 120\u2013150 (amplitude \u2248 -1.1 to -1.3). This trough is broad and smooth with low local volatility (only tiny ripples). SHAP here is neutral/weak.\",\n    \"  - Mid interval (t \u2248 200\u2013320): a smooth low-frequency recovery and small plateau/crest. The signal rises from negative through zero into a rounded mid-peak reaching roughly +0.5\u2013+0.6 at ~250\u2013280, then shows a short dip (~ -0.3) and another rise to a more pronounced positive shoulder around t \u2248 330\u2013370 with amplitude \u2248 +1.4\u2013+1.7.

The model\u2019s SHAP map emphasizes the mid-late trough and the subsequent recovery most strongly, implying it uses the trough depth, width and the following sustained rebound as joint evidence.

The late trough is deeper and longer than the earlier trough; the subsequent recovery is smooth and sustained, forming a pronounced trough\u2192rise pair.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label feature summaries and selecting best match:\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary features: dominant low-frequency lobes, positive plateaus around mid/late parts, but sedans in reference show less extremely deep late troughs; SHAP focus for sedan is on positive plateaus and slow upward transitions. Similarity: moderate (3) because sample has mid/late positive plateaus but also a much deeper trough than typical sedan patterns.\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary features: emphasizes trough\u2192rapid rebound patterns, strong positive attribution to the recovery from the global trough (particularly around ~418\u2192475). Pickup references show deep troughs and strong recoveries as evidence, but pickups often have diagnostic earlier troughs (around 150\u2013220) and steeper mid-sequence ascent as a primary cue. Similarity: moderate (3) \u2014 sample does show a strong recovery after the deep trough (matching pickup pattern), but the strongest positive attribution in pickup descriptions was often tied to an earlier mid trough/rebound pair which here is weaker.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary features: repeatedly characterized by a pronounced deep trough centered near ~420\u2013470 with the strongest positive attribution, plus an early crest/hump and a final sustained rise to the end. The minivan descriptions emphasize the late deep trough as the major discriminative element and low-frequency dominance. Similarity: high (4) \u2014 the sample matches almost all hallmark minivan traits: an early small hump, mid plateau, the dominant deep trough near ~410\u2013470, and a long recovery to a high positive end value. STFT pattern (very-low-frequency energy concentrated during the trough and recovery) also strongly aligns with label 2 summaries.\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary features: strong long low-frequency upward ramp around ~110\u2013220 and rounded high-amplitude peak/shoulder there, with mixed attribution for the deep trough later. Similarity: low to moderate (2) \u2014 sample has some mid-rise and shoulder-like behavior, but the dominant late deep trough and its attribution align better with label 2 than SUV-specific features.\\n\\nBased on the above, label 2 (minivan) is the best match because the single most discriminative event in the sample (the deep, broad trough around ~410 and the long recovery to a high end-plateau) is repeatedly cited in the label 2 summary as the primary positive cue. The sample's global envelope, amplitude extremes, low volatility and dominant low-frequency STFT energy closely mirror the label-2 reference descriptions.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- Reference similar samples labeled 2 (Sample 48 and Sample 37) show extremely similar overall envelopes: early descent to a modest trough, midrise to a local positive peak/plateau, then a very deep trough around ~420\u2013470 and a final long recovery to a high positive value. The shapes and relative timings of extrema are highly consistent with the test sample. STFTs of the provided label-2 references likewise concentrate energy in the lowest frequency bin, especially at the late trough and recovery \u2014 matching the test sample.\\n- Similar sample 2 (Sample 39, labeled 1) also resembles the test sample in many respects (midpeak and deep trough), which explains some ambiguity between labels 1 and 2. However, comparing SHAP/feature descriptions: pickups put more emphasis on earlier trough\u2192rebound events (t~150\u2013270) as decisive; our test sample's most decisive/large-amplitude event is the late trough (~410) which the minivan descriptions highlight as the strongest positive cue. Therefore label 2 remains the better match.\\n- Dissimilar samples (labels 0 and 3 in the provided dissimilar set) either lack the extreme late trough amplitude or emphasize different midsection shapes (e.g., long rising shoulder for SUV) \u2014 these differences further support label 2.\\n\\nFinal assignment and score rationale:\\n- Final predicted label: label 2 (minivan).\\n- Similarity score assigned to this prediction: 4 (high similarity). Rationale for score: the test sample contains the late deep trough + long recovery + low-frequency dominance that are the central and repeatedly emphasized discriminative features in the label 2 feature description; the provided label-2 reference plots closely match the test sample in amplitude, timing and envelope shape. Differences vs. other labels exist but are smaller and do not outweigh the strong alignment with label 2.\\n\\nPer-label similarity summary (for transparency): label 0 -> 3, label 1 -> 3, label 2 -> 4, label 3 -> 2. The final predicted label and the single returned score correspond to the highest match (label 2, score 4).\"\n  ]\n}",

The STFT bright low-frequency energy near the late trough is present in those references as it is in sample 14. That reinforces the label-2 match.\\n  - Comparison to label-1 references: There are also similar samples labeled 1 (e.g., sample 39) that share the trough\u2192recovery motif. Those are reasonably similar, which is why label 1 gets a moderate similarity score. But the training-summary for label 1 often gives more weight to an earlier mid-sequence trough/rebound as the primary diagnostic event; sample 14's strongest, most discriminative event is the late deepest trough and long recovery, which the label-2 description explicitly highlights as the main minivan evidence.\\n  - Consistency / fairness: I compared the specific time-localized amplitudes, slopes, shapes, and STFT energy localizations against the four label summaries and the provided reference plots. The deepest trough magnitude, the timing (late trough near 400\u2013430), and the strong low-frequency recovery to a high endpoint most closely mirror the label-2 pattern in both the description and in the reference samples labeled 2. Differences with other labels are documented above (pickup is plausible but less exact; sedan and SUV match less well because of trough depth and which portion of the waveform they emphasize).\\n\\nFinal per-label similarity quick scores (for transparency): label 0 = 2, label 1 = 3, label 2 = 4, label 3 = 2. These informed the final choice.\\n\\nConclusion (final output): Predicted label = label 2 (minivan). Rationale summary: the sample's dominant, low-frequency envelope \u2014 especially the very deep broad trough near t\u2248410\u2013430 with concentrated low-frequency STFT energy followed by a long, strong recovery to a high terminal plateau \u2014 matches the minivan (label 2) feature pattern most closely and is corroborated by the provided reference examples labeled 2.

I use those red windows to locate corresponding plot segments and describe them precisely:\\n  1) t\u224880\u2013160 (early trough and recovery flank): The trace descends from a positive starting offset (~+1.6 at t\u22480) down through zero and reaches a broad trough near t\u2248130\u2013160 at about \u22121.1 to \u22121.25. The descent is smooth with low volatility (no abrupt spikes), curvature is broad (low-frequency), and there are only tiny high-frequency ripples on the trough bottom (amplitude <<0.1). The STFT shows energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin here, consistent with a long-timescale lobe. SHAP assigns positive weight to nearby low-frequency bins (red), indicating this trough-to-recovery region is being used as evidence.\\n  2) t\u2248200\u2013320 (major positive lobe / plateau): The series climbs from near-zero/negative through zero and reaches a rounded positive plateau/peak centered around t\u2248260\u2013300 with amplitude \u2248+1.0 to +1.4 (locally up to \u2248+1.5 in small sub-peaks). The rise is smoother and faster than the preceding descent (moderate positive slope ~0.02\u20130.035 units/step over ~80\u2013100 steps), and the plateau shows small micro-bumps (low amplitude). STFT again concentrates energy at the lowest frequency bin during this interval; SHAP shows a strong red patch at the bottom frequency aligned to this plateau \u2014 the classifier treats the sustained positive lobe as positive evidence.\\n  3) t\u2248320\u2013440 (deep central trough): After the mid peak the trace moves down and reaches the global trough around t\u2248420\u2013440 with amplitude \u2248\u22121.7 to \u22121.85. The descent into this trough is one of the steepest slopes in the record (noticeably sharper than earlier declines), and the trough is narrower and deeper than the early trough but still smooth (low volatility). The STFT whitened energy remains at very low frequency; SHAP at low frequency around this trough is mixed (small blue/neutral pixels in places), while adjacent low-frequency windows still show positive red mass \u2014 indicating the model uses the trough shape in context but emphasizes particular low-frequency windows more strongly.\\n  4) t\u2248440\u2013576 (final sustained rise to endpoint): From the deep trough the signal climbs steadily and almost linearly to a high positive terminal plateau \u2248+1.5\u2013+1.65 at the end. The rise is smooth, long-duration (hundreds of steps), with very low high-frequency volatility. STFT shows low-frequency energy concentrated at the bottom bin here; SHAP again provides positive attribution in the bottom-frequency row near the end. Together the deep trough plus the long recovery to a high terminal plateau form a salient late-cycle pattern.\\n- Frequency corroboration: The STFT plot shows nearly all energy concentrated in the bottom (lowest) frequency row across the entire timeline, with occasional increases in that bottom bin during the mid-rise and the late recovery. There is almost no sustained mid/high-frequency energy; the micro-bumps at extrema appear as faint higher-frequency traces but they are minor. The SHAP heatmap's red pixels are almost entirely in the bottom-frequency band, confirming the classifier relies on long-wavelength envelope features.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series structure, dependence and combination of features:\\n- Global shape / periodicity: The series is dominated by a long-wavelength oscillatory envelope with roughly two large half-cycles across 577 points: (1) initial high \u2192 early trough (~t\u2248130\u2013160) \u2192 mid positive plateau (~t\u2248260\u2013300), and (2) fall to a deeper trough (~t\u2248420\u2013440) \u2192 strong recovery to a final high (~t\u2248576). This is a multi-humped, low-frequency waveform; its key discriminative components are the timing, amplitude and shape (broadness/sharpness) of the major lobes.\\n- Volatility and slopes: Volatility is low overall (smooth curves) with the most rapid changes being the descent into the deep trough (~t=320\u2013420) and the final recovery slope. Microstructure (small bumps/shoulders) occurs on plateaus and around peaks/troughs but is minor relative to the envelope.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: The classifier apparently treats sequences of trough\u2192slow rise\u2192sustained positive plateau and the later deep trough\u2192long recovery as a coherent multi-stage signature. The mid positive plateau and the final terminal plateau reinforce one another in attribution: SHAP shows positive low-frequency mass in both mid and late windows, which indicates the model uses the order and persistence of these low-frequency lobes rather than isolated instantaneous values.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching the sample to the label feature summaries (which label best matches):\\n- Comparison with label 0 (sedan): The sample exhibits the exact hallmark described for label 0: an early broad negative lobe around t\u224880\u2013160 (~\u22121.1), a broad mid positive peak/plateau around t\u2248200\u2013300 (~+1.3\u2013+1.6), a deep central/trailing trough near t\u2248340\u2013440 (deepest value near \u22121.7), and a final sustained positive rise/plateau by the end (~+1.5). The STFT and SHAP behavior (dominant bottom-frequency energy and positive SHAP concentrated on the slow rises/plateaus) match the label 0 description very closely. This is a high-fidelity match.\\n- Comparison with label 1 (pickup): Label 1 also emphasizes trough\u2192steep rebound patterns and a late recovery; the sample does show trough\u2192rebound events, but label 1 descriptions emphasize a particularly sharp mid-ascent (large slope) and the classifier\u2019s strongest positive mass on the final steep rebound. While sample 17 has a significant mid-rise and late recovery, the overall morphology (two long cycles with mid plateau and terminal plateau) matches label 0 more precisely than the asymmetric sharp-ascent emphasis in label 1. Moderate match.\\n- Comparison with label 2 (minivan): Label 2 is keyed strongly on a pronounced deep late trough in the mid-late window with the deepest SHAP concentration at that trough. Sample 17 does have a deep late trough and positive attribution there, but the label-2 description highlights some other specific front/mid bulges and specific crest/trough ordering that differ slightly from sample 17\u2019s emphasis on mid positive plateau plus late recovery. Low-to-moderate match.\\n- Comparison with label 3 (SUV): Label 3 descriptions also emphasize a long, large-amplitude mid rise (valley\u2192broad shoulder between ~110\u2013220) that the classifier strongly attributes. Sample 17 contains a long mid rise and shoulder, so SUV is plausible. However, the full sequence (prominent mid plateau, then deeper trailing trough followed by terminal plateau) maps more cleanly to the sedan pattern in the provided label summaries. Moderate match.\\n\\nQuantified similarity (preliminary):\\n- label 0: 4 (high similarity \u2014 multiple distinctive features line up: early trough, mid plateau, deep trailing trough, final plateau; SHAP bottom-frequency red alignment present) \\n- label 1: 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 mid trough\u2192steep rebound and late recovery present but overall shape is less asymmetrically steep than pickup prototypes) \\n- label 2: 2 (low-to-moderate \u2014 shares deep late trough and recovery but lacks some of the supporting mid bulge/feature weighting characteristic of minivan summaries) \\n- label 3: 3 (moderate \u2014 shares valley\u2192broad rise motif but the combination and timing of subsequent lobes match label 0 more closely)\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference examples and final decision:\\n- I compared the test trace to the provided similar reference plots: sample 20 (label 0) is visually nearly identical in envelope and extremum timing (early trough ~120, mid plateau ~260\u2013300, deep trough ~420, end rise), and its SHAP heatmap likewise concentrates red in the lowest-frequency band over the mid and late windows. Similar-sample 57 and other label-3 references are close but show slightly different emphasis in SHAP (and sometimes weaker mid plateau vs shoulder shapes). The test trace\u2019s SHAP and STFT patterns (dominant bottom-frequency energy and red attribution on the mid and terminal plateaus) align best with the label-0 examples and text description.\\n- Fairness and scoring logic: I gave the highest score to label 0 because multiple independent cues (timing and amplitude of the three main lobes, low-frequency dominance in STFT, SHAP red concentration on the mid/late low-frequency rows) all match the sedan (label 0) signature in the summary. Pickup and SUV share some similar substructures (trough\u2192rise) so they receive moderate scores; minivan receives the lowest score because some of its described supporting features (particular early hump shapes and differing SHAP emphasis on trough) are less present.\\n\\nFinal conclusion:\\n- Predicted label: label 0 (sedan). Reason: the series shows the canonical sedan envelope described in the label-0 summary \u2014 early broad trough (~t=80\u2013160, \u22121.1), broad mid positive plateau (~t=200\u2013300, +1.3\u2013+1.6) with low volatility, a deeper trailing trough (~t=420\u2013440, \u22121.7 to \u22121.85) and a long, smooth final rise to a high plateau at the end. The STFT and SHAP corroborate that the classifier would be focusing on the very-low-frequency envelope at those time windows, matching label 0\u2019s reported discriminative pattern.\\n\\nPer the required output format I assign an overall similarity score of 4 (high similarity) for label 0.\"\n    ]\n}",
      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 0\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local feature (SHAP red regions -> time plot) analysis:\\n- SHAP red energy is concentrated in the lowest-frequency band and localized primarily around three low-frequency windows: (a) roughly t \u2248 150\u2013210, (b) roughly t \u2248 200\u2013320 (overlapping with (a) but strongest near 200\u2013300), and (c) the final right-hand rise roughly t \u2248 520\u2013576. These low-frequency rows correspond to slow, large-amplitude envelope features in the time trace.\\n- Window A (t \u2248 80\u2013140 / preceding red center at ~150\u2013210): the time series shows a broad, smooth trough with minimum around t \u2248 120 at about -1.15. The trough shape is low-volatility (smooth curvature), width ~30\u201360 steps, and micro-ripples of very small amplitude (~0.01\u20130.05) at the bottom. The STFT shows energy concentrated in the bottom bin here (very-low-frequency). SHAP red overlapping the low-frequency band indicates this trough-to-rise transition is positively attributed.\\n- Window B (t \u2248 200\u2013300): the signal climbs from near-zero/weak negative through zero to a broad rounded positive peak centered \u2248 260\u2013300 with amplitude \u2248 +1.3 to +1.6. The rise rate is moderate-to-steep (average slope on the main rising limb \u2248 +0.02\u2013+0.035 units/step), the crest is a short plateau/rounded top with small superposed micro\u2011oscillations (low amplitude). Volatility on the plateau is low. STFT confirms an increase in very-low-frequency magnitude during this interval. SHAP red is strongest here in the lowest frequency bin, so the classifier is treating this sustained low-frequency positive lobe (rounded peak + plateau) as strong positive evidence.\\n- Window C (t \u2248 340\u2013440): although SHAP shows neutral-to-slight negative pixels for portions of the deep trough, the sample has a second trough centered \u2248 410\u2013430 with minimum around -1.7 (the deepest trough). This trough is narrower and somewhat steeper than the first trough but still dominated by low-frequency content; it also has small micro\u2011ripples on the flanks. The model gives this deep trough little positive SHAP (consistent with the model valuing the positive plateau more than extreme negative excursions in some labels).\\n- Final window (t \u2248 480\u2013576, and especially 520\u2013576): the series performs a steady, low-volatility rise from the deep trough back to a final plateau \u2248 +1.5\u2013+1.65 at the end (average slope \u2248 +0.02 per step). SHAP again shows positive attribution at the lowest frequency band here, indicating the late recovery / sustained positive terminal lobe is reinforcing the predicted class.\\n- Frequency corroboration: the STFT image shows nearly all signal energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin throughout the record; higher-frequency bands are nearly empty except for tiny bursts at extrema. That supports the interpretation that the classifier is using long-timescale envelope shapes (broad lobes) rather than fast texture.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / combined time-series characterization:\\n- Overall waveform: a low-frequency dominated oscillatory envelope with roughly two slow cycles across 577 points: initial high \u2192 first broad trough (~t 80\u2013140) \u2192 broad positive peak (~t 200\u2013300) \u2192 deep mid/late trough (~t 340\u2013440) \u2192 final steady rise to a positive plateau at the end (~t 520\u2013576).\\n- Amplitudes: maxima near +1.5\u2013+1.65 (start and end), minima near -1.15 (first trough) and -1.7 (second trough). The second trough is deeper than the first, producing an asymmetric oscillatory envelope.\\n- Volatility: low overall; micro-ripples are present at peaks and troughs but have low amplitude relative to the envelope and little high-frequency STFT energy. The major transitions are smooth and long-duration (dozens to hundreds of steps). The classifier\u2019s SHAP emphasizes sustained low-frequency rises and plateaus more than deep negative excursions.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: the discriminative pattern is the ordered sequence trough \u2192 slow rise \u2192 sustained positive plateau and the later deep trough \u2192 recovery to final plateau. The timing and duration of the positive mid-wave (t \u2248 200\u2013300) and the final rise (t \u2248 520\u2013576) are the positively attributed events; the deep mid/late trough is present but not the primary positive cue.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label patterns and provisional selection:\\n- Compare to label summaries:\\n  * Label 0 (sedan): Description emphasizes dominant very-low-frequency lobes with a first trough at ~80\u2013140 near -1.15, a broad positive peak at ~200\u2013300 around +1.5 with plateau and small ripples, a deep trough ~340\u2013440 near -1.7, and final positive rise/plateau at the end. This is an almost exact match in timing, amplitude, shape and SHAP-attributed locations.\\n  * Label 1 (pickup): Also low-frequency with deep troughs and large recoveries, but pickup patterns emphasize a steep mid-sequence ascent centered differently and stronger attribution to the recovery from the global trough around ~418\u2013475; sample 17's strongest positive SHAP covers the mid positive lobe and the final rise rather than a single strong trough-to-recovery event in the middle \u2014 pickup is a reasonable but weaker match.\\n  * Label 2 (minivan): Has a dominant deep rear trough and slightly different front/mid hump patterns; while sample 17 has a deep trough near 420, the ensemble of features (timing of mid positive plateau and two-cycle envelope) matches label 0 more closely than label 2.\\n  * Label 3 (SUV): Characterized by a long, high-amplitude mid-rise/shoulder (t \u2248 110\u2013220) and rounded peak; there is overlap with sample 17 (it does have a long rising shoulder into a rounded peak). However the sedan description explicitly lists the sequence of trough ~80\u2013140, broad positive peak ~200\u2013300, deep trough ~340\u2013440 and final rise \u2014 sample 17 conforms to that sedan archetype more precisely.\\n- Provisional decision: label 0 (sedan) best matches the combined timing, amplitude, shape and the SHAP-attributed low-frequency windows.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against reference examples and final scoring:\\n- Reference samples shown: several reference time-series labeled 3 (SUV) look similar but the annotated 'similar sample 2' labeled 0 (sample 20) is almost visually identical to sample 17 (same trough/peak timings, same amplitudes, same two-cycle low-frequency envelope). The SHAP heatmaps for label-0 references highlight low-frequency rows at mid-peak and end rise \u2014 same as sample 17.\\n- Dissimilar examples: one dissimilar reference is a pickup (label 1) whose SHAP emphasis was concentrated on a different trough\u2192rapid recovery region; sample 17\u2019s SHAP is more distributed across the midplateau and final rise which aligns with the sedan explanation in the provided label summaries.\\n- Similarity scoring (per label, summary used to verify fairness):\\n  * Label 0 (sedan): score = 4 (high similarity). The sample\u2019s exact sequence of low-frequency lobes, timings, amplitudes, and SHAP-positive windows match the sedan pattern nearly exactly.\\n  * Label 1 (pickup): score = 2 (low similarity). Some elements (deep trough + recovery) are present in both, but the key mid-sequence attribution patterns differ in timing and emphasis.\\n  * Label 2 (minivan): score = 2 (low similarity). The strong deep rear trough is present but other minivan-specific substructures (front bulge + mid small protrusion pattern) and SHAP emphasis do not align strongly.\\n  * Label 3 (SUV): score = 3 (moderate similarity). The SUV pattern shares the long low-frequency rise/shoulder and rounded peak with this sample, but the full ordered envelope (two lobes with described trough timings and the final recovery) matches the sedan description more closely.\\n\\nFinal verification and conclusion:\\n- Multiple checks (time-domain shape, STFT low-frequency dominance, SHAP positive rows and their time locations, and comparison to the provided reference samples and label summaries) consistently point to label 0 (sedan) as the best match.\\n- Because the sample's features align extremely closely with the sedan archetype in the provided documentation (including the specific times/amplitudes of the troughs and peaks and the SHAP attribution pattern), I assign the highest similarity score (4) for label 0 and select label 0 as the predicted class.\"\n  ]\n}",

In the test sample the strongest SHAP is at the mid plateau and at the end rather than concentrated only at the deep trough, so the sample matches the sedan/SUV patterns better than the canonical minivan pattern.

The model appears to weight the deep trough magnitude and/or integrated low-frequency energy in a way that favors label 2, despite SHAP for this sample showing stronger positive attribution at the mid and final rises (which align with sedan/SUV signatures). This suggests the model's internal decision boundary leans toward trough-driven cues for minivan in some cases, producing a different label than the visual/SHAP-driven human reading.\",\n    \"Step 5 \u2014 final decision and alternatives: Given the time-domain morphology, STFT concentration at very-low frequencies, and SHAP concentrating positive attribution on the mid plateau and final recovery (the exact saddle/plateau + terminal-lobe pattern described for sedans), I assign label 0 (sedan) as the best classification. The closest alternative is label 3 (SUV) because of the pronounced midrise/shoulder which both classes share. The black-box label 2 (minivan) is plausible but less supported by the SHAP attribution pattern here and the human-match to the provided label summaries.\",\n    \"Step 6 \u2014 verification: I reviewed potential mis-focus risks: the black-box likely prioritized the deep trough magnitude (driving its minivan output) while two independent human-read analyses emphasized the sequence of mid- and end-lobes (driving sedan).

Frequency content (strong lowest-bin energy) and the shape/locations of extrema match label 3 descriptions closely. => High match.\\n - Label 0 (sedan) summary key signatures: dominant very-low-frequency oscillation with alternating broad troughs and positive plateaus (notably positive plateaus near \u2248200\u2013300 and again at the end), with micro-ripples at extrema. The sample also has broad lobes and positive plateaus at similar times, so there is substantial overlap with sedan patterns as well.

The sample does have a deep trough and a strong recovery to positive by the end, which is consistent with pickup features; yet pickup descriptions emphasize the trough\u2192rapid rebound as the primary discriminative event (SHAP concentrated on the recovery).

The sample does show a very deep trough and recovery, however minivan descriptions include a distinct mid hump/crest structure earlier and a particular arrangement of crests/troughs (front bulge then mid trough then large rear trough).

However the model\u2019s described distinguishing cue for label 3 is the strong mid-section shoulder/rounded peak as the primary positive evidence, which sample 19 has very clearly. The pickup references emphasize the trough\u2192rebound as primary\u2014sample 19 has that too but not as the sole or earliest dominant cue.\\n - Dissimilar references labeled 2 (samples 37 and 48) show more irregular intermediate humps and a different ordering/amplitude pattern of crests/troughs; sample 19 differs from those and aligns better with label 3 references.\\n\\nConclusion and final classification: the best matched label is label 3 (SUV). The waveform, its timing of main extrema, low-frequency STFT concentration, the prominent valley\u2192broad mid-rise/rounded peak (t\u2248120\u2013240), a short post-peak spike, followed by a very deep trough (t\u2248380\u2013410) and a sustained recovery to a high end-plateau are all strongly consistent with the SUV description and the provided label-3 reference samples. After cross-checking ambiguities with labels 0 and 1, label 3 remains the most consistent choice.\\n\\nFinal similarity scores (summary): label 0 = 3, label 1 = 3, label 2 = 2, label 3 = 4. The output label is label 3 with similarity score 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

Change rate: steady positive slope (moderate average slope ~+0.01\u2013+0.02), with a short shoulder/plateau near the crest (small micro-bumps). Volatility: low overall with small wiggles at the top. STFT: localized increase in very-low-frequency magnitude during rise/peak.\\n- t = 260\u2013320: partial decline from that peak back toward ~+0.2\u2013+0.4; contains a short sharper dip then quick small recovery (local sub-spike). Shape: brief correction; short-duration higher slope than the long ramps; small higher-frequency content visible as small ripples.\\n- t = 320\u2013400: long, steep descent from mid positive down toward the global trough. Rate: relatively high negative slope; amplitude falls progressively from ~+0.5 to deep negative. Volatility: low, smooth descent with small superimposed micro-oscillations.\\n- t = 400\u2013440 (global trough window): deepest trough in series centered ~400\u2013420 with amplitude \u2248 \u22122.0 to \u22122.15. Shape: wide but relatively sharp compared with earlier troughs (prolonged near-minimum). Volatility: low at trough bottom; STFT shows the largest low-frequency magnitude aligned here (strong energy in lowest bin).\\n- t = 440\u2013520: sustained recovery from the deep trough back into positive territory; steep but smooth rise; a short local bump/dip near ~500 (a small trough around 500\u2013520) then continued rise. Amplitude: \u22122.1 up to ~+1.2 by ~520. Change rate: relatively high positive slope in the recovery phase.

Volatility: low; shape: terminal positive plateau consolidating a large-scale rebound.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features, periodicity and temporal dependencies:\\n- Dominant timescale and frequency content: the series is dominated by very low-frequency components (STFT concentrated at the lowest bins). There are roughly two long half-cycles: an early trough\u2192peak around t\u224880\u2013230 and a deeper trough\u2192recovery around t\u2248320\u2013576. High-frequency content is minimal and localized at extrema.\\n- Trend & envelope: the record shows a large-amplitude oscillatory envelope with asymmetric slopes (the rise to the mid-peak is smoother/longer; the fall into the global trough is steeper). The strongest geometric events are the rounded mid-peak (t\u2248200\u2013230) and the deep global trough (t\u2248400\u2013420) followed by a strong final recovery to a high positive plateau.\\n- Volatility: low overall; micro-ripples confined to peaks/trough flanks and short transient dips. The classifier-like cues in the dataset descriptions emphasize these slow envelope features (timing, amplitude, width) rather than high-frequency noise \u2014 consistent with the STFT.\\n- Temporal combination: the sequence of earlier trough \u2192 sustained rise \u2192 rounded high plateau \u2192 steep decline \u2192 deep trough \u2192 sustained recovery is coherently ordered. The timing and relative magnitudes of the mid-rise/rounded peak and the later deep trough + recovery form the primary discriminative signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison to label feature summaries and initial label selection (per-label similarity scores):\\n- Label 3 (SUV) \u2014 Known signature: a pronounced broad low-frequency mid-rise/shoulder centered around ~110\u2013220, a rounded high-amplitude peak/plateau there, and later a steep deep decline to a strong trough with mixed attribution; energy concentrated at very low frequencies. Match to sample: HIGH. Sample 19 exhibits a strong valley\u2192broad rise and rounded peak at t\u2248160\u2013230 and a later steep descent to a deep trough around 400\u2013420 followed by a strong recovery \u2014 patterns explicitly described for label 3. Score: 4/4.\\n- Label 0 (Sedan) \u2014 Known signature: dominant low-frequency oscillation with successive lobes (troughs and positive plateaus), positive attribution at sustained plateaus and rises. Match to sample: MODERATE. Sample 19 shares the low-frequency oscillatory structure and positive end-plateau, but SUVs' mid-rise/rounded shoulder + deep trough is a closer match to label 3 descriptions than to the sedan template that emphasizes specific plateau timing and less extreme trough depth. Score: 3/4.\\n- Label 1 (Pickup) \u2014 Known signature: deep trough-to-rapid-rebound pairs, strong positive attribution at trough\u2192rise events and steep rebounds. Match to sample: MODERATE/LOW. Sample 19 does have a deep trough followed by a strong recovery (a pickup-like cue), but pickups' emphasis in descriptions is on particular mid-sequence trough/rebound timing and asymmetric ascent being the strongest cue; sample 19 also has the earlier rounded mid-rise which is more SUV-typical. Score: 2/4.\\n- Label 2 (Minivan) \u2014 Known signature: several ordered crest/trough patterns but key is a very strong broad rear trough centered later and a particular front/mid bulges. Match to sample: LOW. Sample 19 contains a deep late trough, but overall the mid-rise shoulder and the pattern of timing and relative shapes align better with label 3; minivan examples emphasize a different ordering and particular localized protrusions. Score: 2/4.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- Similar references labeled 3 (samples 51 and 44): visually nearly identical: early descent \u2192 mid broad rounded rise/shoulder at t\u2248110\u2013220 with a plateau and small micro-bumps, then a steep fall to a deep trough around ~400\u2013420 and strong recovery to a late plateau. STFTs of refs 51/44 show the same concentrated low-frequency energy and a bright low-frequency band aligned with the deep trough/recovery interval \u2014 matching test sample 19's STFT (notably the yellow band near 366\u2013418). This is strong confirmation of label 3.\\n- Similar reference labeled 1 (sample 59) and labeled 0 (sample 23) are somewhat similar in overall low-frequency oscillatory envelope, but sample 59 (pickup) emphasizes the trough\u2192rapid rebound as the key discriminant; sample 19 does show a rebound but also the pronounced mid-rise/shoulder that is distinctively SUV-like. Sample 23 (sedan) also shares low-frequency lobes but has different emphasis on plateau timing and lacks the extremely deep trough present here. Thus refs reinforce the choice of label 3 over labels 0/1.\\n- Dissimilar references labeled 2 (samples 37 and 48): these minivan examples show more and differently placed smaller-scale bulges and different ordering (and often multiple mid crests), which are not dominant in sample 19. That reduces likelihood of label 2.\\n\\nFinal decision & justification: The test sample's defining combination \u2014 a strong valley\u2192broad mid-rise with a rounded plateau/shoulder near t\u2248160\u2013230, followed by a steeper decline to a very deep trough (~400\u2013420) and then a pronounced recovery to a high positive terminal plateau \u2014 matches the label-3 (SUV) pattern descriptions and the provided label-3 reference samples very closely (both in time-domain shape and STFT low-frequency signatures). Therefore the most accurate classification is label 3 (SUV) with high similarity. The per-label similarity evaluations used above are: label 0 = 3, label 1 = 2, label 2 = 2, label 3 = 4. The returned score (4) corresponds to the high similarity / high confidence for the chosen label 3.\"\n  ]\n}"

I map those to the trace and STFT to describe exact local features.\\n\\n1) Early positive window (SHAP bottom row, t \u2248 80\u2013110):\\n   - Corresponding time-series feature: a broad negative trough whose minimum is near t \u2248 120 (values about -1.0 to -1.25) preceded by the initial descent from +1.6. The SHAP red region slightly precedes the trough bottom and overlaps the rising flank into the trough\u2019s recovery. \\n   - Amplitude/time range: trough amplitude \u2248 -1.0\u2026-1.25; SHAP window roughly 80\u2013110 (30 time-steps). \\n   - Shape & trend: smooth, low-volatility concave trough (low-frequency), descent and subsequent gentle recovery. \\n   - Volatility & frequency: STFT shows energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin with negligible mid/high-frequency power in this window (so a long-wavelength envelope feature). \\n   - Implication: the classifier gives positive credit to this broad low-frequency trough + the following slow recovery segment as a discriminative outline element.\\n\\n2) Mid positive window (SHAP bottom row, t \u2248 340\u2013380):\\n   - Corresponding trace: the series sits at a positive plateau/shoulder between about t \u2248 250\u2013320 (a smooth rise to \u2248 +1.0) and then a smaller peaked/substructured region near t \u2248 300\u2013320; the SHAP mid-window aligns with the later part of that higher section and the start of the descent into the next negative half-cycle. \\n   - Amplitude/time range: local positive values \u2248 +0.8\u2026+1.2; SHAP window ~340\u2013380 picks up the sustained positive plateau/shoulder and small perturbations. \\n   - Substructure: small micro-bumps/shoulder and a short, somewhat sharper spike-like subfeature (a narrow bump) are present in the mid-200s\u2013300s region; these show up as small localized increases in low-frequency energy in STFT and modest positive SHAP. \\n   - Volatility & frequency: still dominated by lowest frequency bin; tiny higher-frequency ripples at the small spike are weak in STFT. \\n   - Change rate: the rise into the plateau is moderate; the subsequent drop beyond this window is steeper.\\n\\n3) Dominant late positive window (SHAP bottom row, t \u2248 450\u2013520):\\n   - Corresponding trace: this is the region immediately after the global minimum (deep trough) centered \u2248 460\u2013480 where the signal climbs from its most-negative value (\u2248 -2.1 to -2.25) back to large positive values at the series end (~+1.6\u2013+1.7). The SHAP red cluster is strongest here. \\n   - Amplitude/time range: trough minimum \u2248 -2.1\u2026-2.25 near t \u2248 470; recovery to +1.6 by t=576. The positive-attribution window covers roughly the trough-to-recovery interval (\u2248 450\u2013520). \\n   - Trend & change rate: steep, sustained upward ramp (average slope over recovery \u2248 +0.02\u2013+0.03 units/step), smooth with very low short-term volatility except for small bumps during the early recovery. \\n   - Frequency: STFT shows the highest low-frequency magnitude aligned with this window (bottom row brightest near 418\u2013471), confirming this is a large, slow envelope change rather than a transient high-frequency event.\\n\\nOverall for Step 1: SHAP\u2019s positive attribution consistently lines up with broad, low-frequency envelope features: an early trough + recovery, a mid positive shoulder/plateau with a small localized bump, and\u2014most importantly\u2014a deep late trough followed by a long low-frequency recovery to a high terminal plateau. All three are smooth (low volatility) large-amplitude events (STFT concentrated at near-zero frequency). \\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Global structure / periodicity: The series is dominated by very low-frequency oscillatory envelope behavior spanning the whole 577 points (roughly two long half-cycles or about two full low-frequency cycles across the record). Energy in the STFT is concentrated at the lowest-frequency bins throughout. \\n- Major extrema & ordering: (1) a moderate early positive start (~+1.6) that declines to a broad trough near t~120 (~-1.1), (2) a long rise to a mid positive plateau/shoulder (~+0.9\u2013+1.1 around t~260\u2013320) with a small sharper sub-peak, (3) a steep descent to a deep global trough near t~470 (~-2.1 to -2.25), (4) a long, steady recovery to a high positive terminal plateau (+1.6 at the end). \\n- Volatility & substructures: Generally low volatility on plateaus and trough bottoms; small high-frequency micro-ripples occur at extrema and on short spikes (visible as faint energy at slightly higher bins in STFT). \\n- Asymmetry and slopes: Rises are often smoother/moderate except the final recovery which is steep and long; descents into late troughs are among the steepest transitions. \\n- Temporal dependence: The classifier appears to be leveraging the ordered sequence trough \u2192 sustained rise/plateau \u2192 deep trough \u2192 long recovery. The timing and relative magnitude of especially the deep late trough + subsequent recovery are central to the sample\u2019s class evidence (per SHAP).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label summaries and selection of best label (feature similarity scoring rationale):\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary key points: dominant low-frequency envelope, early front bulge, mid cabin rise/plateau, a distinct pronounced deep rear trough around t\u2248420\u2013480 with the strongest SHAP attribution, followed by a steep terminal recovery to positive values. The label-2 summaries repeatedly emphasize a very strong positive SHAP at the late deep trough and final rise. \\n  -> Sample 30 match: High. The sample exhibits all the same critical elements (early trough and small front bulge, mid positive plateau with small peak, a very deep trough near 460\u2013480 which is the strongest SHAP region, and a long recovery to +1.6). STFT and SHAP align with the label-2 description. \\n  -> Similarity score: 4 (high similarity).\\n\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary key points: low-frequency trough\u2192steep rebound patterns, strong mid-sequence trough followed by sharp rises, and notable final recovery windows; SHAP often emphasizes trough-to-recovery transitions as evidence. \\n  -> Sample 30 match: Moderate. Sample 30 has trough\u2192recovery motifs and a late strong rebound which is also described for pickups; however the pickup descriptions emphasize a relatively sharper mid-sequence ascent and specific timing where the midrise is more diagnostic. In Sample 30 the midrise is present but less sharply diagnostic and the dominant discriminative event (per SHAP) is the late, very deep trough + recovery \u2014 which aligns more strongly with label 2. \\n  -> Similarity score: 3 (moderate similarity).\\n\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary key points: a long, high-amplitude, smooth upward ramp in the mid-section (t \u2248 110\u2013220) culminating in a rounded shoulder/peak; classifier attributes heavily to that long rising shoulder. \\n  -> Sample 30 match: Low\u2013moderate. Sample 30 does contain a mid rise/shoulder (around 200\u2013320), but its amplitude and exact timing/shape differ from the prototypical SUV long ramp emphasized in label-3 summaries (SUV\u2019s ramp is often earlier and smoother/longer). The strongest SHAP support in Sample 30 is not centered on such an SUV-like long rising shoulder but on the late trough+recovery. \\n  -> Similarity score: 2 (low similarity).\\n\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary key points: dominant low-frequency lobes with positive plateaus at the end and emphasis on wide positive peaks and troughs; SHAP highlights long smooth positive plateaus and some micro-ripples at extrema. \\n  -> Sample 30 match: Low. Some sedan features (positive terminal plateau, low-frequency lobes) appear in the sample, but sedan summaries often emphasize particular positive plateaus earlier and more balanced lobes across cycles. The defining deep late trough (very negative) in Sample 30 is less characteristic of the sedan summaries which treat extremely deep troughs as neutral/negative. \\n  -> Similarity score: 2 (low similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four provided similar reference samples (Samples 55, 34, 32, 28) are all labeled 2 (minivan) and their waveforms closely match Sample 30: (start high \u2192 early trough near t~120 \u2192 mid positive plateau/shoulder around t~260\u2013320 with small bumps \u2192 deep late trough around t~420\u2013480 \u2192 recovery to high terminal plateau). Their STFTs also show strongest low-frequency energy at the late trough window and their SHAP heatmaps show positive bottom-band attribution in the same three general windows (early, mid, and strongest late). Sample 30\u2019s morphology and the SHAP attribution map are therefore highly consistent with these label-2 exemplars.\\n- The dissimilar examples labeled 0 and 3 illustrate the differences: label-0 example emphasizes positive mid-peak and does not show such an extreme late trough with dominant SHAP there; label-3 (SUV) shows an earlier, longer mid ramp as the most strongly attributed region. Sample 30\u2019s strongest attribution is the late deep trough \u2192 recovery, which matches minivan references rather than those dissimilar examples.\\n- Scoring fairness and consistency check: given the visual/quantitative alignment of amplitude, timing of extrema and the STFT/SHAP corroboration with the label-2 prototypes, assigning label 2 with highest confidence is consistent and fair. The per-label similarity integers above (Label2:4, Label1:3, Label3:2, Label0:2) reflect how many of the label-defining elements are present and how strongly SHAP aligns with the prototypical windows.\\n\\nFinal decision and explanation: \\n- Predicted class: label 2 (minivan). \\n- Confidence / score for this label: 4 (high similarity). \\n- Primary reasoning summary: Sample 30 shows the canonical low-frequency, multi-lobe silhouette of class 2: an early trough + recovery, a mid plateau/shoulder with a small localized bump, and a dominant deep trough near t\u2248460\u2013480 followed by a long, steep recovery to a positive terminal plateau. The STFT concentrates energy at the lowest frequencies at the same times SHAP marks as strongly positive, and the sample\u2019s full temporal pattern closely matches the provided label-2 reference samples and descriptive summary.\"\n    ]\n}"

The decline accelerates approaching the trough; slope magnitude here is larger (steeper negative change). The trough bottom around t\u2248400\u2013430 reaches the sample's global minimum \u2248 -2.0 (deep, wide U-shaped trough).

Our sample shares many global traits with label 0 (low-frequency dominant, rounded positive plateau in mid-sequence, small ripples), but the key difference is that our sample's very deep trough near t\u2248400\u2013430 (\u2248 -2.0) is described in the label_0 summary as either neutral or slightly negative evidence for sedans. Because the deepest negative excursion in our sample is a strong, central discriminative event for some other labels, this reduces the match to label 0. Similarity: 3 (moderate).\\n - Label 1 (pickup): summary emphasizes pronounced trough\u2192sharp sustained rebounding rises, strong positive attribution to trough-to-recovery transitions (notably strong SHAP at the recovery around t\u2248418\u2013475 in the pickup description). Our sample has a deep trough near 400\u2013430 followed by a sustained recovery to end; that matches pickup's late trough\u2192recovery motif. However, pickup descriptions often also highlight an earlier diagnostic trough around t\u2248157\u2013209 (an earlier deep negative half-wave and a steep mid rise). Our sample does not show an equally strong early trough/rebound pair in that early-mid window (the largest trough is the late one), so the match is partial. Similarity: 2 (low\u2013moderate).\\n - Label 2 (minivan): summary emphasizes low-frequency silhouette with an early-to-mid small hump, mid shallow troughs, then a dominant deep U-shaped trough centered around t\u2248420\u2013470 (minimum down to \u2248-1.6 to -1.9 in references) and a strong recovery to high positive at the end; the label description explicitly states the deep rear trough near t\u2248420\u2013480 is the major positive cue and that the STFT and SHAP concentrate importance at that late trough. Our sample matches these points very closely: a deep, broad trough near 400\u2013430 reaching \u2248 -2.0, dominated low-frequency energy there, and a steady recovery to a high positive terminal plateau. The early trough near 100 and mid positive hump near 200\u2013300 are also present, consistent with label_2 patterns. Similarity: 4 (high).\\n - Label 3 (SUV): summary emphasizes a long, high-amplitude upward ramp in the mid-section (t\u2248110\u2013220) culminating in a rounded peak/shoulder that strongly contributes to the SUV label; thereafter a deep trough can appear but is often neutral or mildly negative for SUV attribution. Our sample does contain a substantial mid-section rise and rounded peak around t\u2248200\u2013260 which resembles SUV descriptions; however SUV summaries tend to place the strongest positive evidence on the mid rise/shoulder rather than on a late deep trough. Since our sample's discriminative event is the deep late trough + recovery (which label_3 treats as mixed/neutral), the overall best match is still label_2. Similarity: 3 (moderate).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 selection: the highest matching label is label 2 (minivan) because the presence, amplitude, width and timing of the deep late trough (~t=400\u2013430, value \u2248 -2.0) plus the subsequent long recovery to a positive terminal plateau exactly match the label_2 summary where that late trough is described as the strongest positive cue. I therefore choose label 2 as the final classification and assign a confidence similarity score of 4 (high similarity to label_2 pattern).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 cross-check against provided reference samples and final verification:\\n - Reference sample 51 (label 3) and sample 44 (label 3) are visually similar in global shape (they also have mid rise and deep late troughs). That explains why SUV (label 3) gets a moderate similarity: many classes share the same long low-frequency envelope. However the label_3 summaries emphasize the mid rise/shoulder as the primary discriminative feature; in our test sample the late trough is far more pronounced and the STFT energy concentrates at that trough \u2014 consistent with label_2 importance in the provided summaries.\\n - Reference sample 23 (label 0) also resembles the test sample. The sedan summaries emphasize positive plateaus and trough\u2192rise sequences; again the late trough in our sample is notably deeper than described as characteristic for a sedan and label_0 SHAP descriptions indicated such deep late troughs are neutral/negative for sedans, reducing the similarity relative to label_2.\\n - The two dissimilar examples shown (samples 48 and 37, both annotated label 2 in the reference set) closely resemble the test sample: similar early descent, mid rise, then very deep trough near t\u2248400\u2013470 and strong recovery. This corroborates that the test sample matches the minivan (label_2) prototypes in the dataset.\\n - Consistency check: the STFT for the test sample shows the largest low-frequency energy concentrated at the late trough and recovery interval, which the label_2 description specifically calls out as the primary positive evidence. The microstructure and volatility across the series (small ripples at extrema, otherwise smooth) are also consistent with label_2 descriptions.\\n\\nFinal assessment: given the strong match in the timing, amplitude, shape and low-frequency energy of the deep late trough and the subsequent recovery to a high positive terminal plateau \u2014 all hallmarks of the label_2 (minivan) pattern in the provided summaries and reference examples \u2014 the most accurate classification is label 2. Per the requested similarity quantification I give label_2 the highest score (4). Per-label similarity scores (for transparency) used in the decision were: label_0 = 3, label_1 = 2, label_2 = 4, label_3 = 3.\"\n    ]\n}",

STFT confirms negligible persistent high-frequency content.\\n- Relative slopes and asymmetries: The mid-rise (\u2248140\u2013240) is a steady upward ramp; the descent into the global trough (\u2248320\u2013420) is steeper and deeper than earlier descents. The final recovery is substantial and smooth.

Match analysis: sample 32 contains the same sequence: early trough (~100), mid positive plateau (~220\u2013260), deep trough (~400\u2013420) and terminal rise to ~+1.5. Depth of the global trough in sample 32 is slightly deeper (~-2.0) than the typical sedan description (\u2248-1.6/ -1.7) but otherwise timing, low-frequency dominance, and smooth microstructure align well. Similarity: moderate\u2013high.\\n- Label 1 (pickup): pickups emphasize a mid-sequence deep trough followed by a relatively fast rebound, and strong positive attribution on the late recovery segment (global trough around ~418 and recovery to end). The sample shows a strong recovery after the deep trough and a mid-rise earlier; however pickup descriptions often emphasize a particularly diagnostic early trough near 150\u2013200 then a steep rise; in sample 32 the early trough is present but shallower. Similarity: moderate.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) [summary features]: minivan profiles in the summary include an early small bulge, a broad mid trough (~80\u2013170, \u2248-1.1), a central cabin rise (~200\u2013320 to \u2248+0.9\u20131.2), a pronounced large rear trough in the mid-late window (~380\u2013480, often the deepest feature \u2248 -1.7 to -1.9), and a final strong recovery to the end. The sample matches these elements closely: early bulge and mid trough, central rise to a plateau/peak, a dominant deep trough ~400\u2013420 (indeed very deep here), and a smooth recovery to a high terminal plateau. The STFT/low-frequency dominance in the sample and the temporal ordering of crest \u2192 deep rear trough \u2192 final rise align very closely with the label_2 description (the label_2 text even uses 'Sample 32' as an exemplar in the supplied summaries). Similarity: high.\\n- Label 3 (SUV): SUVs are characterized by a strong long ramp/shoulder from trough to high between ~110\u2013220 culminating in a rounded shoulder/peak and then a later deep trough; sample 32 does have a strong mid ramp and rounded peak, and a later deep trough; SUV and minivan descriptions overlap in mid-section rise and deep late trough. But label_3 emphasizes that the mid rising shoulder is the main discriminative element (with SHAP strongest around 110\u2013220). Sample 32 does show that, but the extreme depth of the later trough and how it aligns with the provided minivan pattern tilts higher similarity to label_2.\\n\\nQuantified per-label similarity (1\u20134 scale):\\n- label 0 (sedan): 3 (moderate similarity). Many structural elements match (timing of trough & peak & final plateau), but the very deep global trough in sample 32 is more extreme than the typical sedan template.\\n- label 1 (pickup): 3 (moderate similarity). The long recovery from a deep trough and mid-rise are shared; however the characteristic early-mid trough depth/shape is not as strongly diagnostic as in pickup summaries.\\n- label 2 (minivan): 4 (high similarity). The temporal order, the prominence of a late deep trough, the central rise/plateau, and the low-frequency dominance exactly match the minivan pattern; additionally the provided label_2 description explicitly references 'Sample 32' as an exemplar, confirming a very high match.\\n- label 3 (SUV): 3 (moderate similarity). The mid-section strong ramp/shoulder and the later deep trough are similar, but compared to SUV templates the sample's strongest discriminative element is the deep late trough which is more emphasized in the minivan summary.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against the provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The similar reference images include samples labeled 51 and 44 (label 3) and sample 23 (label 0), and sample 59 (label 1). All of those series look visually close to sample 32 (similar low-frequency lobes, mid-peak, deep late trough, final recovery). This confirms that the global low-frequency oscillatory motif is shared across labels and that distinguishing depends on subtle timing/amplitude relationships. The dissimilar references (samples 48 and 37, labeled 2 in the provided dissimilar list) nevertheless also show similar shapes to sample 32; however the original label_2 description explicitly used the phrasing and statistics that match sample 32 closely (late deepest trough magnitude and timing, and central plateau features). Given the explicit matching in the label_2 feature write-up (including mention of the deep trough around t\u2248420 and the final strong recovery) and the near-exact ordering/magnitude in the test series, label 2 is the best single label choice.\\n\\nFinal decision and confidence: I classify the test sample (Sample 32) as label 2 (minivan). The match to the label_2 feature pattern is high (score = 4). The other three labels receive moderate similarity scores (3) because they share many low-frequency waveform characteristics, but they lack the precise combination of (1) an early shallow trough and central rise, (2) a very deep mid-late trough (the strongest discriminative extremum), and (3) a smooth terminal recovery that together are most strongly described in the label_2 summary.\"\n  ]\n}"

Energy in STFT is concentrated at the lowest frequency bins throughout; transient higher-frequency content is minimal and limited to small substructures at extrema.\\n- Amplitude/shape: two major positive peaks (~+1.3\u2013+1.5) and one deep negative trough (~-2.2) in the later half; the later trough is both deeper and steeper than the earlier trough.

Sample 34 does have a mid positive region and a positive terminal plateau, but sedan descriptions emphasize smoother, more symmetric lobes and less extreme later troughs. Sample 34's very deep trough (~-2.2) and the steep descent before it are stronger than typical sedan notes. Moderate similarity but weaker than SUV.\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary: emphasizes deep troughs followed by a relatively rapid, sustained low-frequency rebound (often with strong positive SHAP on the recovery) and some asymmetric half-cycles; the pickup pattern often centers positive attribution on trough\u2192rebound events. Sample 34 has a deep trough and a large recovery, so there is partial overlap; however pickup descriptions often have the discriminative midrise earlier (centered ~150\u2013220) as a recovery from trough and sometimes different timing of key positive attribution. Similarity is moderate-to-low compared with SUV.\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary: several alternating crests/troughs with the late deep trough being a primary driver and strong low-frequency envelope features. There is some resemblance (deep late trough + recovery), but minivan patterns in the summary include a specific sequence of front bulge, mid trough, central cabin rise and distinct mid protrusion; sample 34's clearest match remains the long valley\u2192broad mid-rise\u2192rounded peak motif emphasized for SUV. Moderate similarity but lower than SUV.\\n\\nProvisional similarity ratings (1\u20134) to each label (used for decision): label 0 (sedan) = 3, label 1 (pickup) = 2, label 2 (minivan) = 2, label 3 (SUV) = 4.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and finalize:\\n- The provided similar reference examples for label 3 (samples 51, 9, 44) show nearly identical envelope structure: an early trough near ~100, a long mid-section rise & rounded peak ~180\u2013300, a steep descent to a deep trough ~360\u2013420, then recovery to a final positive plateau. Sample 34 matches that sequence closely in timing, amplitude and low-frequency dominance. The STFTs are also consistent (low-frequency concentration with a bright patch around the deep trough window). That empirical match reinforces label 3.\\n- The single similar label-0 example (sample 23) shares some traits (mid positive lobe and terminal plateau) but differs in the magnitude and sharpness of the late trough and in where the model attribution would lie per the summaries \u2014 sample 34's deep trough and steeper descent align better with the SUV reference set.\\n- The dissimilar label-1 examples show different timing of primary discriminative trough\u2192rebound events and less emphasis on the midsection rounded shoulder as the main positive cue; sample 34's strongest matching cue is the mid-rise/rounded peak motif highlighted for SUVs.\\n\\nConclusion: Sample 34 best matches label 3 (SUV). The match is high because the sample contains the central valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded mid-peak \u2192 steep deep trough \u2192 strong recovery \u2192 terminal plateau pattern that the label-3 summary and reference samples consistently describe.

High-frequency content is minimal and localized to small ripples at extrema or the small dip around ~520; STFT confirms energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins with strongest magnitude around the deep trough interval.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature analysis and temporal dependencies:\\n- Global trend & periodicity: The waveform is a slow, low-frequency oscillation with roughly two long half-cycles across the 577 steps: early high\u2192down\u2192up\u2192sharp mid spike\u2192deep down\u2192final up.

The descent into the central trough (around t\u2248360\u2013410) is the steepest and reaches the most negative amplitude (~-2.2), deeper than earlier troughs. Ascents and descents are asymmetric: some rises (e.g., the spike at ~290) are relatively sharp while some declines (e.g., into the central trough) are sharper/steeper.\\n- Volatility: Low overall; micro-ripples are present primarily at peaks/trough bottoms and at the short dip around t\u2248520.

Sample 34 shares low-frequency lobes and plateaus but the presence of a very deep central trough (~-2.2) and the sharp mid spike are more extreme than typical label 0 examples; label 0 tends to have shallower troughs and emphasis on positive plateaus. Therefore moderate-to-high similarity but not as strong as label 3.\\n- Compare to label 1 (pickup): Label 1 features emphasize deep trough followed by very rapid robust recovery and mid-sequence steep ascent as discriminative. While sample 34 has a deep trough and recovery, label 1 often has its strongest discriminative troughs earlier (and SHAP emphasis differs). The mid spike & shape/shoulder pattern in sample 34 aligns better with label 3. So similarity to label 1 is lower.\\n- Compare to label 2 (minivan): Label 2 emphasizes sequences of front bulge, mid shallow troughs and a very large late trough plus strong recovery; there is some overlap (deep late trough + recovery), but minivan patterns often include a characteristic front bulge and multiple smaller structured crests in a particular order. Sample 34's mid spike and high mid-section shoulder + particularly deep trough match label 3 descriptions more closely than label 2.\\n\\nConclusion of matching: The highest matching label is label 3 (SUV). Based on manifested features (mid-section broad ramp/shoulder + local spike, very deep trough around 360\u2013420, strong low-frequency energy in STFT there, final recovery/plateau) the sample is best matched to the label 3 feature set.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with the provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- Comparison to similar reference samples labeled 3 (samples 51, 9, 44): Those references show almost the same temporal pattern \u2014 an early descent to a trough, a pronounced mid rise/shoulder and rounded peak, then a steep descent to a deep trough in the 360\u2013420 region and a recovery to the right-end plateau. The amplitude ranges and low-frequency dominance in STFT are highly similar. Visual alignment of peak/trough timing and amplitude confirms a close match.\\n- Comparison to similar sample labeled 0 (sample 23): Sample 23 is similar in low-frequency envelope but its mid-structure and attribution emphasis differ slightly (sample 23 has a somewhat less extreme central trough). Given the stronger correspondence to multiple label-3 examples and the explicit mid-shoulder+deep trough motif described in label-3 documentation, label 3 is still the best fit.\\n- Comparison to dissimilar label-1 references (samples 4 and 11): These show different timing/shape of discriminative events (the strong mid-rise/rebound structure in those pickups is placed and shaped differently), and STFT patterns emphasize different windows; sample 34 is less consistent with label 1.\\n\\nFinal decision & justification: Assign label 3 (SUV). The match is high because the distinctive mid-section broad rise/shoulder (including a local spike), the very deep trough centered near t\u2248390\u2013405, and the sustained recovery to a high terminal plateau all line up with the label-3 feature summary and the provided label-3 reference samples. STFT corroborates by showing strongest low-frequency energy at the same deep-trough interval (bright band ~366\u2013418). Given the close agreement in timing, amplitude, shape, volatility (low), and spectral signature, I assign similarity score = 4 (high similarity) for label 3.\"\n  ]\n}"

Change rate: moderate negative slope (steady descent over ~100 steps). Volatility: low; only small high-frequency ripples at the trough bottom (~\u00b10.02\u20130.06). STFT: low-frequency energy concentrated in the bottom bin in this window.\\n - t = 120\u2013300: steady, low-volatility rise from the early trough through zero to a rounded positive plateau/peak near t\u2248260\u2013280 at ~+1.4\u2013+1.6. The ascent is relatively steeper than the initial descent (noticeable positive slope), with a short plateau/shoulder near the crest and minor micro-bumps on the top. STFT: increased power still concentrated at the lowest frequency bin; almost no persistent mid/high-frequency energy.\\n - t = 300\u2013420: after the mid peak the signal slowly falls and then accelerates downward into a deep trough. The fall steepens approaching the trough; there are small local bumps on the falling flank, but overall volatility stays low until the trough. STFT continues to show strong energy at lowest frequency; small transient increases at transitions.\\n - t = 420\u2013475: the global minimum occurs here (\u2248 -1.8 to -2.0 around t\u2248420\u2013435). The trough is relatively deep and broad (sustained low values for many steps) and the bottom shows low micro-variance. STFT: strong low-frequency magnitude at this time window.\\n - t = 475\u2013576 (end): a smooth, fairly steep recovery from the deep trough back up to a high positive plateau (+1.5 to +1.6) at the series end. The rise is sustained and low-volatility with small superimposed tiny oscillations near the late peak. STFT: again dominated by the lowest-frequency band with energy concentrated at the times of the major rise.\\n Overall microstructure: small, short-duration ripples are present mostly near extrema and on inflection flanks; these are low amplitude relative to the long-wavelength envelope and show as faint higher-frequency energy in the STFT. The STFT image confirms dominant energy in the very-low-frequency bins across the whole series and small localized increases in the bottom rows at the times of the major rises/troughs.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal dependencies:\\n - Dominant characteristics: a long-period, low-frequency oscillatory envelope with roughly two main half-cycles across 577 steps: (1) initial high \u2192 broad trough (~t\u2248100), (2) strong rise to a broad positive peak (~t\u2248260\u2013280), (3) descent to a deep global trough (~t\u2248420\u2013435), (4) sustained recovery to a final positive plateau at the end. The waveform is smooth and low-volatility overall, with localized micro-ripples at extrema.\\n - Trends & slopes: asymmetric slopes are present \u2014 earlier descent is moderate, the mid ascent is relatively steep, and the fall into the deep central trough is steeper in places; the final recovery is sustained and moderately steep. These asymmetric transitions plus the timing of plateaus are consistent, producing a characteristic temporal sequence trough \u2192 rise \u2192 peak \u2192 deep trough \u2192 recovery.\\n - Frequency content: STFT shows nearly all energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency band; there is negligible consistent mid/high-frequency energy. This indicates discriminative information is the long-wavelength silhouette envelope (shape & timing of broad lobes) rather than high-frequency texture.\\n - Combination/temporal dependence: the classifier must be using the ordered sequence of low-frequency events (location, amplitude and width of troughs and peaks and the slope asymmetries) rather than isolated instantaneous values. The long positive plateau near the mid-window and the final end plateau are reinforcing features that occur in the expected time positions for the matching class.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries (which label best matches?):\\n - Label 0 (sedan): The catalogued sedan pattern emphasizes dominant low-frequency lobes at ~80\u2013140 (broad trough), ~200\u2013300 (broad positive peak/plateau), a deeper trough ~340\u2013440, and final positive rise/plateau near the end. Sample 50 matches those elements almost exactly in timing, amplitude and shape: early broad trough (~100, -1.1), mid broad peak (~260\u2013280, +1.4\u20131.6), deep trough (~420, -1.8 to -2.0), and final sustained rise to ~+1.6. STFT and low-volatility microstructure also match. Thus label 0 has very high similarity. (similarity score: 4)\\n - Label 1 (pickup): Pickup patterns also show low-frequency trough\u2192rise\u2192recovery structure and emphasize strong mid-sequence rises and final recovery. Sample 50 shares some of these traits (notably the strong rise and final recovery), but pickups usually emphasize slightly different timing/attribution (the pickup description often highlighted the mid trough-to-peak rebound as the main diagnostic event). Sample 50 matches some pickup characteristics but less closely than sedan (timing and relative emphasis align better to sedan). (similarity score: 3)\\n - Label 2 (minivan): Minivan patterns emphasize an early small front bulge, a mid shallow trough, a mid plateau with a short sharper positive spike and a dominant deep rear trough near ~420 with a final rise. While there is some overlap (deep rear trough and final rise), minivan descriptions give particular weight to other mid-window microfeatures (e.g., a sharper localized protrusion) that are not prominent here. The sample lacks several of the minivan's specific mid-substructures and so matches only weakly. (similarity score: 2)\\n - Label 3 (SUV): SUV description focused on a pronounced long low-frequency rising shoulder in the mid-section (a strong valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded shoulder) that is the primary positive cue. Sample 50 does have a mid rise/shoulder near t\u2248150\u2013280, which partially overlaps the SUV motif, but the full SUV pattern also involves other distinctive shapes (and the SUV summaries indicated different relative attributions for the later deep trough). Overall the match is weaker than label 0. (similarity score: 2)\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with the provided reference samples and final verification:\\n - The four provided 'similar' reference plots (samples labeled 0.0) show nearly identical waveforms: initial high \u2192 broad trough at ~100 \u2192 broad mid peak at ~260\u2013280 \u2192 deep trough near ~420 \u2192 final recovery to +1.5\u20131.6. Their STFTs likewise concentrate energy at the lowest bins with similar small bursts at the same windows. Sample 50 is visually and spectrally nearly indistinguishable from those reference label-0 examples (same timing of lobes, amplitudes, slope asymmetries, and low volatility). This confirms the label-0 assignment.\\n - The two provided 'dissimilar' examples (label 2.0) show additional internal complexity (extra peaks/notches earlier, different mid-window microstructure) and slightly different amplitude relationships; sample 50 does not show those extra small early peaks and thus is less like label 2.\\n - Based on the close alignment of local features, global temporal structure, frequency content and the near-identical appearance to multiple label-0 reference samples, the most accurate classification is label 0 (sedan). I assign the highest similarity score (4) for label 0 and lower scores for the other labels as listed above (label1:3, label2:2, label3:2). The JSON 'score' field reports the similarity for the chosen label (4).\"\n  ]\n}"

Volatility is generally low (smooth ramps) except for slightly higher slope during the steep descent into the global trough and the brief spike around t\u2248310.\\n  - Amplitude structure: maxima roughly +1.4\u2013+1.6 (start, mid\u2011peak, end); minima include a mid negative trough near -1.1 and a deeper global trough near -2.0. The deepest negative excursion is a defining feature.\\n  - Temporal relationships: the midsection valley\u2192long rise\u2192rounded plateau motif (centered roughly 120\u2013280) is followed by a sharper descent to the deepest trough (\u2248320\u2013420) and then a sustained recovery to a positive terminal plateau (420\u2013576). The sequence and relative amplitudes of these events (timing of rise/peak then deep trough then recovery) form the key discriminative pattern.\\n  - Frequency-domain corroboration: STFT shows energy concentrated in the lowest frequency band throughout; localized increases in the bottom band coincide with the major ramps and especially with the deep trough and the late recovery. There is negligible sustained mid/high\u2011frequency energy \u2014 micro\u2011ripples are minor.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 match to label feature summaries and initial scoring reasoning:\\n  - Label 3 (SUV) summary key points: strong long low\u2011frequency upward ramp/shoulder around t\u2248110\u2013220 culminating in a rounded peak (~250\u2013280), followed by a substantial descent into a deep trough (~360\u2013420) and then recovery; classifier emphasizes the valley\u2192broad rise\u2192rounded peak motif as most diagnostic. This matches sample 59 closely: sample 59 has the long ramp/shoulder, rounded mid peak, then steep deep trough (~-2.0) and final recovery to positive plateau. High alignment in timing, amplitude and overall shape.\\n  - Label 0 (sedan) summary key points: dominant low\u2011frequency oscillation with broad troughs and broad positive plateaus; positive attributions on sustained positive plateaus (e.g., mid and final plateaus) and micro\u2011ripples at extrema. Sample 59 does show positive plateaus at mid and end, and broad troughs, so there is moderate similarity to label 0 as well, but sedan summaries emphasize smoother, less extreme negative excursions and greater positive SHAP weight on multiple plateaus; sample 59\u2019s extremely deep trough (~-2.0) and the strong valley\u2192shoulder motif align better to label 3.\\n  - Label 1 (pickup) summary: emphasized a mid trough followed by a relatively fast rebound and large-amplitude recovery late in the series as diagnostic. Sample 59 does have a late recovery, but pickup descriptions emphasize specific mid\u2011sequence trough\u2192rebound timing (earlier troughs and faster steep rises) and often different slope asymmetries. The overall valley\u2192rounded\u2011peak\u2192deep trough\u2192recovery order of sample 59 fits better with label 3 than the pickup prototypical pattern.\\n  - Label 2 (minivan) summary: strong low\u2011frequency deep troughs are discriminative (especially large rear trough near 420) and model places strong positive attribution on that trough. Sample 59 does have a deep trough around 418 which superficially matches label 2. However minivan patterns in the provided summaries typically also include a characteristic sequence of front bulge, mid hump and a very dominant late trough as the single most diagnostic event; whereas sample 59\u2019s mid shoulder/rounded peak (t\u2248250) plus strong valley\u2192shoulder motif is more emphasized in the SUV description. Given the available reference examples and summaries, sample 59 matches label 3 better overall (especially the pronounced mid rise/shoulder + rounded peak preceding the deep trough).\\n\\n  - Preliminary similarity ranking (qualitative): label 3 = highest, label 0 = moderate, label 2 = moderate\u2011low (shares deep trough but lacks some minivan preconditions), label 1 = lowest.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 reference-sample cross\u2011check and final verification:\\n  - Visual comparison with provided similar training samples: Sample 51 (label 3) and Sample 8 (label 3) are nearly isomorphic to sample 59 \u2014 same early decline, long low\u2011frequency rise to a rounded peak around 240\u2013270, short correction/spike, then steep descent to a deep trough near t\u2248410\u2013420 and a long recovery to a positive end plateau. Those label\u20113 examples match sample 59 very closely in amplitude, timing, volatility profile and STFT bottom\u2011band energy. This provides strong empirical support for label 3.\\n  - Comparison with label\u20110 references (samples 23 and 13): those are similar in the sense of slow oscillatory envelope and positive plateaus, and indeed sample 59 shares many global traits with label 0. However the extreme depth of the global trough (~-2.0) in sample 59 and the pronounced valley\u2192shoulder\u2192rounded peak motif are more consistently described and exemplified in label 3 references than in the label 0 descriptions.\\n  - Comparison with label\u20112 references (dissimilar samples): label\u20112 examples also contain deep troughs but their overall pre\u2011trough structure (front bulge + mid hump behavior and the relative timing) differ from sample 59. The provided dissimilar label\u20112 samples show different local substructures (additional intermediate peaks/plateaus earlier) and slightly different timing of troughs versus sample 59.\\n  - Scoring fairness check: given the near one\u2011to\u2011one match between sample 59\u2019s mid\u2011section valley\u2192long ramp\u2192rounded peak followed by the steep deep trough and recovery and the label\u20113 reference descriptions and examples (samples 51 and 8), assigning the highest similarity score to label 3 is justified. Label 0 is the runner\u2011up (shares envelope characteristics) but lacks the precise combination emphasized by label 3. Label 2 shares the deep trough but not the preceding mid\u2011rise/shoulder as strongly. Label 1 is the least similar in terms of the typical pickup signatures described.\\n\\nFinal classification and justification:\\n  - Predicted label: label 3 (SUV).\\n  - Similarity score: 4 (high similarity). Justification: multiple distinct and temporally-ordered low\u2011frequency features of sample 59 \u2014 an early trough then a long, high\u2011amplitude low\u2011frequency rise to a rounded mid peak (\u2248t=220\u2013280), followed by a rapid deep trough (\u2248t=360\u2013420) and a long recovery to a final positive plateau \u2014 match the label\u20113 feature summary and training examples very closely in amplitude, timing, shape and frequency content (STFT bottom\u2011band concentration).

By ~100\u2013120 the signal reaches about -1.05 to -1.2. Rate: moderate negative slope (~ -0.01 to -0.02 units/step). Volatility: low (smooth curve) with very small high-frequency ripples visible as tiny jaggedness on the trough bottom. STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin; no sustained higher-frequency content.\\n\\n- t = 120\u2013220: recovery from the early trough to zero then into a sustained positive ramp. The rise is relatively steady with accelerating slope near the end of this window. By ~200 the value is around +0.8\u2013+1.0. Substructure: small micro-bumps on the rising flank (low-amplitude). Volatility: still low; change rate positive and moderate.\\n\\n- t = 220\u2013320: continued ascent to a local rounded peak/plateau centered ~250\u2013270 with amplitude ~+1.2\u2013+1.4. The crest contains a short plateau/shoulder and tiny high-frequency wiggles. Shortly after the plateau there is a small dip/correction around ~290\u2013310 and a brief local spike near ~310\u2013320 (a short sharper positive bump). Slope: ascent earlier in window steeper than the small spike's change. STFT: low-frequency energy increases near the ascent and crest; small localized upticks in slightly higher bins corresponding to the micro-bumps.\\n\\n- t = 320\u2013420: after the mid-plateau the signal declines; the descent accelerates and becomes the steepest fall in the record. From ~320 down through ~418 the trace falls strongly into the global minimum. By ~418 the trough reaches about -2.0 to -2.15 (deep and prolonged for several tens of steps). Volatility: low (smooth), but magnitude and slope are large (steep negative slope ~ -0.02 to -0.03). STFT: strong low-frequency energy concentrated while descending into the deep trough.\\n\\n- t = 420\u2013576 (end): a smooth, sustained recovery from the deep trough up to the final high plateau at the right edge; values climb from ~ -2.0 at ~418 to ~+1.5 at the end (t=576). The rise is relatively steady and nearly linear on this interval with small top-side micro-oscillations once positive. Volatility: low; STFT: low-frequency energy prominent during the long recovery; a localized bright low-frequency magnitude appears around the trough region (consistent with the deep excursion).\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / combined features and time-frequency summary:\\n- Dominant low-frequency envelope: almost all signal power lies in the lowest STFT band; the waveform is a long-period oscillation with roughly two major cycles across 577 steps (early trough -> mid peak -> deep trough -> final rise). High-frequency content is minimal and confined to small ripples at extrema and a brief spike around ~310.\\n- Amplitude structure: early peak ~+1.5, two main negative troughs (first ~ -1.1 around t~100; second/deep trough ~ -2.0 near t~418), a central positive plateau (+1.2\u2013+1.4 at ~250\u2013270), and a high terminal plateau around +1.5. The deepest negative excursion is the mid-late trough (~ -2.0) which is the largest absolute magnitude in the series.\\n- Temporal dependence and asymmetry: asymmetric slope magnitudes \u2014 rises are generally smoother/longer (except the mid ascent which is relatively faster) while the fall into the deepest trough is steeper. The classifier (from training summaries) tends to rely on the timing and shapes of these slow lobes (positions and amplitudes of troughs and peaks) rather than short spikes.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists (qualitative comparison):\\n- Label 3 (SUV) summary key points: strong low-frequency long upward ramp in mid-section (~110\u2013220), a rounded peak/shoulder (~250\u2013280), then a steep descent to a deep trough (~360\u2013420) and later recovery. SHAP emphasis on the mid-rise/shoulder as discriminative. Test sample match: HIGH. The sample contains a pronounced mid rising shoulder (t~110\u2013220), a rounded crest at ~250\u2013270, then a steep deep trough ~418 and recovery to a high terminal plateau. The STFT low-frequency pattern and the small spike/shoulder substructures align closely with label 3 descriptions.\\n\\n- Label 0 (sedan) summary key points: dominant low-frequency oscillation with broad trough (~80\u2013140), broad positive peak (~200\u2013300) and again trough (~340\u2013440) and final rise; classifier focuses on low-frequency plateaus and upward transitions. Test sample match: MODERATE\u2013HIGH. The sample indeed has the early trough, the broad positive mid-peak and final rise described for sedans. Differences versus label 3 are subtle: label 0's emphasis is more on the positive plateaus as the main positive cues, while label 3 emphasizes the mid-rise shoulder as discriminative. The test has both features, so it matches sedan well but not better than SUV.\\n\\n- Label 1 (pickup) summary key points: strong trough-to-recovery events and very pronounced steep mid-ascent and final recovery; emphasis on an early/mid trough followed by a steep rebound. Test sample match: MODERATE. The test features deep trough and strong recovery, but pickups in the summary place heavier positive emphasis on the earlier trough-to-peak rebound and timing differences; the test's mid-plateau and mid-late deep trough align less specifically with the pickup archetype than with SUV/sedan.\\n\\n- Label 2 (minivan) summary key points: pronounced deep rear trough (~420\u2013480) is central positive evidence; multiple alternating crests/troughs with the late deep trough strongest. Test sample match: LOW\u2013MODERATE. The test does have a very deep trough near ~418 which minivan descriptions emphasize strongly; however minivan patterns often show a particular sequence of mid positive crest and an even stronger emphasis on the late trough as the main driver. While similar here, other mid-section details (the shoulder/rounded crest at ~250) and the shape of the early trough are more consistent with labels 0/3.\\n\\nQuantitative similarity ranking (before reference recheck): label3 > label0 > label1 > label2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Re-check with provided reference samples and finalize scores:\\n- Visual comparison with the provided similar references: test sample 59 is nearly visually identical to the supplied sample 51 (Label 3) and sample 8 (Label 3): same early descent to ~-1.1, same mid long ramp and rounded crest near 250\u2013270, same steep descent to a deep trough near 410\u2013420 and same final recovery to positive plateau. The two reference samples labeled 0 (samples 23 and 13) are also similar but differ in subtle substructure (their mid-peak shapes and where SHAP emphasis lies in the training summaries). Given the near one-to-one match with samples 51 and 8 (both labeled 3), and the label descriptions that emphasize the mid-rise/shoulder as the decisive cue, label 3 is the best fit.\\n- Dissimilar references (label 2 samples 48 and 37) show more differences in early-to-mid substructure and/or different crest/trough timing despite sharing a deep trough; the test aligns less with those patterns than with the label 3 references.\\n\\nFinal decision & similarity scores (1\u20134 scale):\\n- Chosen label: label 3 (SUV). Rationale: test sample's dominant low-frequency mid-rise/rounded shoulder (~110\u2013270), followed by a steep descent into a deep trough (~360\u2013420) and a sustained final recovery matches the SUV (label 3) feature description and matches the provided label-3 reference samples nearly exactly.\\n\\nSimilarity scores (per label):\\n- label 0 (sedan): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 many shared large-scale lobes and mid-plateau, but some discriminative substructures align better with label 3)\\n- label 1 (pickup): 2 (low\u2013moderate similarity \u2014 shares trough-to-recovery elements but timing/shape differ from pickup archetype)\\n- label 2 (minivan): 2 (low similarity \u2014 shares the deep late trough but overall mid-section and emphasis differs)\\n- label 3 (SUV): 4 (high similarity \u2014 near match to reference samples 51 and 8 and to the SUV pattern description)\\n\\nConsistency & fairness check: scoring is based on (1) presence/absence of the SUV-defining mid-rise/rounded shoulder, (2) timing and amplitude of the deep trough, (3) low-frequency dominance in STFT, and (4) visual match to reference plots. Two reference samples labeled 3 are extremely similar to the test series; although label 0 references are also similar, the mid-rise shoulder/rounded-peak motif and the timing of the largest positive attribution windows match label 3 more strongly. Therefore final classification is label 3 with highest similarity score 4.\"\n    ]\n}"
