        "Observation: Strong positive SHAP (red) localized at the lowest frequency row (near 0 Hz) between approximately time steps 130 and 186. -> Implication: The classifier is using a sustained low-frequency / DC-like elevation in this time window as evidence for the 'EPILEPSY' label. On the time-series plot this corresponds to a period (\u2248115\u2013160) that follows a sharp upward transient and shows a higher baseline (less negative values) with a slow downward drift; such a slow baseline shift produces power near 0 Hz in the STFT and is therefore highlighted by SHAP.",
        "Observation: Distinct positive SHAP patches at mid-low frequencies (~0.08\u20130.2 Hz) occurring roughly between time steps 55 and 120 (most visible \u224874\u2013115). -> Implication: The model attributes importance to transient low-frequency oscillatory content in the mid-section of the series. On the plot this coincides with two abrupt upward transients/peaks (one centered near step ~75 and another near ~115) and the subsequent slower decays; these events generate short-lived low-frequency energy seen in the STFT as increased magnitude at low but nonzero frequencies.",
        "Observation: First large upward transient (peak) at \u2248time steps 70\u201380: amplitude jumps from \u2248-4.0 to a local maximum \u2248-1.45 (peak value) then falls back to \u2248-2.5 by \u224880\u201390. Change rate/steepness: ~+2.5 to +2.8 change over ~10\u201315 steps (mean slope \u2248 +0.17 to +0.19 units/step). Volatility: the rise is steep, followed by a moderately fast fall. -> Implication: This sharp, high-amplitude deflection (sudden large movement) is a salient transient that produces both a broadband time-domain signature and concentrated low-frequency energy; it likely corresponds to a seizure-like jerk that the model relies on.",
        "Observation: Second large upward transient at \u2248time steps 100\u2013115: amplitude climbs again from \u2248-4.3 to \u2248-1.45 (similar magnitude to first peak), with a very rapid ascent concentrated in \u224810\u201315 steps (slope roughly +0.18\u20130.20 units/step). Immediately after this second spike the series sustains a higher plateau (\u2248-1.5 to -2.0) for ~10\u201320 steps (\u2248115\u2013135) before a gradual decline. -> Implication: The repetition of two high-amplitude spikes and a following sustained elevated plateau is interpreted by the classifier as a sequence-of-events pattern characteristic of the epilepsy class (repeated jerks + post-event tonic-like sustained activity).",
        "Observation: Mid-to-late window (\u2248130\u2013160) shows a gradual negative trend from the elevated plateau down to \u2248-3.6 (a slow decay over ~30 steps) with reduced high-frequency variability. STFT confirms most power during this period is concentrated at very low frequencies (near 0). -> Implication: This slow decay / tonic-like phase contributes positive SHAP at 0 Hz and indicates the model uses slow, sustained motion/posture changes following spikes as a discriminative feature (consistent with seizure-mimicking sustained movements).",
        "Observation: Early section (\u22480\u201355) is low-amplitude and low-volatility: values range \u2248-5.2 to -4.3 with gentle upward drift and small local fluctuations. STFT shows relatively little energy at nonzero frequencies in this window. -> Implication: The classifier treats this early calm baseline as neutral or negatively contributing (little red SHAP there); the important diagnostic events are the later abrupt spikes and the sustained baseline shifts.",
        "Observation: Local transient dip around \u224885\u201395 where amplitude falls from \u2248-2.5 down to \u2248-4.0 over ~8\u201312 steps (slope \u2248 -0.12 to -0.19), producing a sharp downward deflection following the first peak. -> Implication: The rapid rebound/dampening after a spike creates alternating slopes (rise then fall) that enrich the low-frequency and transient content; these substructures (fast spike + rebound) strengthen the model's seizure-like attribution.",
        "Observation: STFT summary \u2014 majority of spectral magnitude concentrated at the very low-frequency band (0 Hz) across the whole trace, with intermittent increases in low-but-nonzero frequencies (~0.08\u20130.2 Hz) coinciding with the two spikes and the plateau. -> Implication: The time-frequency signature confirms that the discriminative information is not high-frequency rhythmic motion but rather abrupt transients and slow baseline/tonic components. The model emphasizes these low-frequency/stepwise events for classification.",
        "Observation (time ~5\u2013100): The series exhibits rapid, high-amplitude spikes and troughs. Amplitude swings from about 1.1 up to 6.3\u20136.8 (peaks) and back to ~1.3\u20132.5 repeatedly; individual rises/falls of ~2\u20134 amplitude units often occur within short windows of 1\u20135 time steps (high instantaneous slope). Volatility is high (frequent large directional changes), the waveform is jagged with many sharp local maxima and minima (alternating spike\u2013trough substructure). The STFT shows increased energy not only at the very lowest band but also in a mid-frequency band (relative frequency ~0.1\u20130.25 on the plot) during this interval. Implication: This high-frequency, high-variance spike-train is a strong positive contributor to the 'epilepsy' label (SHAP red). It corresponds to an ictal-like convulsive pattern \u2014 repeated fast jerks/irregular contractions that the classifier treats as seizure evidence.",
        "Observation (time ~90\u2013115): There is a pronounced, brief trough followed by a rapid recovery. Around ~92\u201398 a sharp drop reaches a local minimum near ~0.9\u20131.0, then within ~10\u201315 time steps the signal climbs back up to ~4.0\u20134.6. The change is asymmetric (faster fall then slightly slower rise) producing a V-shaped transient. STFT at this moment shows a temporary redistribution of power (reduced mid-frequency bursts, sustained low-frequency content). Implication: The trough + rapid rebound acts as a transitional feature (end of intense jerking \u2192 quick rebound) that the model partly attributes positively to the seizure class (localized red region in SHAP around this time), likely signaling a brief termination or reorganization of ictal activity.",
        "Observation (time ~115\u2013140): Following the rebound the signal settles to a smoother elevated plateau (values ~3.8\u20134.6) with lower short-term volatility compared to the earlier spike-train. Oscillations here are slower and less jagged (smaller slope magnitudes, changes of ~0.1\u20130.5 units/step). The STFT shows dominant low-frequency energy and reduced mid/high-frequency content in this interval. Implication: This calmer, sustained elevation is interpreted by the model as part of the seizure/post-ictal signature (positive SHAP contributions at low-to-mid bands), representing either continued abnormal movement at lower frequency or the immediate post-ictal motor expression.",
        "Observation (time ~150\u2013205): The series shows a gradual decline in volatility with slow undulating behavior: a dip to ~1.8\u20132.0 around ~155\u2013165, followed by a smoother rise back to ~4.0 around ~180 and then a gentle decline toward ~3.0 by the end. Changes are gradual (small slopes), and the waveform has fewer sharp spikes. STFT shows energy concentrated near the lowest frequency band for much of this period, with intermittent weak mid-frequency content. Implication: These low-frequency, lower-volatility oscillations also contribute positively in patches (SHAP red at some low-mid bands in this window). The classifier likely interprets this as post-ictal slow movements or residual rhythmic motion consistent with an epileptic event rather than steady activities like running/sawing/walking.",
        "Observation (frequency-domain baseline): Across the entire recording the STFT image shows a persistent, strong magnitude at the lowest frequency band (the bottom row is bright for many time steps). SHAP heatmap shows positive contributions at those low frequencies during core epochs (especially early\u2013mid times). Implication: The classifier relies not only on transient spikes but also on sustained low-frequency power (baseline shifts / slow oscillations). This suggests both the presence of slow components (sustained offsets or slow rhythmic movement) and their co-occurrence with higher-frequency bursts are informative for labeling as epilepsy.",
        "Observation (negative-attribution pockets): SHAP shows distinct blue (negative) areas at the lowest frequency band around ~140\u2013160 and at a few isolated early times. The corresponding plot windows are either the sharp trough (~92\u201398) or the relatively quiescent dip (~150\u2013165) where amplitude and volatility are low. Implication: These segments reduce the model's seizure likelihood (they resemble non-seizure or resting behavior). The classifier treats extreme low-activity troughs or stabilized low-volatility intervals as counter-evidence to epilepsy, consistent with a model that balances high-variance ictal bursts against low-activity quiescence.",
        "Observation (local periodicity / repetition): During the early spike-train (0\u2013100), spikes are not strictly periodic but show quasi-regular spacing: many peaks recur every few to several time steps producing a pseudo-rhythmic pattern. The STFT shows repeated mid-frequency power bursts during that epoch. Implication: The classifier appears to treat this quasi-periodic burstiness (repeated jerks at a moderately consistent cadence) as an important seizure marker, combining both frequency-domain patterning and time-localized amplitude bursts for positive attribution.",
        "Observation (time steps ~12\u201324): The raw trace shows a tightly repeating oscillation with peaks near 3.0\u20133.8 and troughs around 0.4\u20131.0. Peak-to-trough change is large (\u22482.5\u20133.4 units) occurring every ~4\u20136 samples (visible as a dense series of up/down cycles). The STFT shows a strong, localized concentration of energy in the lowest frequency band at these times. The SHAP heatmap shows a strong red block at low frequencies here. -> Implication: A high-amplitude, low-frequency rhythmic component in this interval is a major positive contributor to the model predicting EPILEPSY; this pattern is consistent with sustained rhythmic motor activity (mimicked seizure) rather than an isolated transient.",
        "Observation (time steps ~34\u201395): The signal maintains persistent oscillatory structure but with slightly lower peak amplitudes (roughly 1.5\u20133.2) and somewhat reduced trough depth (\u22480.8\u20131.5). Cycle-to-cycle amplitude variation is moderate (some cycles a bit larger/smaller), producing a sustained band of energy in the STFT between the very-low and low-mid frequencies. The SHAP map again shows predominantly red in this frequency band over this time span. -> Implication: A sustained, quasi-periodic oscillation across dozens of samples contributes positively to the epilepsy label; the classifier relies not only on single sharp events but on extended rhythmicity in low-frequency bands.",
        "Observation (time steps ~70\u2013100, substructure): Within the sustained oscillation there are repeated asymmetric cycles: faster rise (steeper positive slope) followed by slower decay (shallower negative slope). These asymmetric waveforms are visible in the raw trace and correspond to localized elevated spectral energy in the STFT; SHAP values here are red-hot in the 0.08\u20130.18 frequency band. -> Implication: The particular shape (fast-onset, slower-offset cycles) provides discriminative information for the epilepsy class \u2014 the model attributes more positive evidence where this asymmetric rhythmic motif appears.",
        "Observation (time steps ~140\u2013160): The time series contains a few abrupt, large negative excursions (single-sample-to-few-sample drops down to about \u22121.0 to \u22121.6), visible as sharp downward spikes that break the otherwise rhythmic pattern. The STFT shows comparatively less organized energy for these moments, and the SHAP heatmap shows blue (negative) attribution at low frequencies around this interval. -> Implication: These abrupt negative transients decrease the model's predicted probability of EPILEPSY (they are treated as negative evidence). They likely correspond to non-seizure artifacts or gestures that do not match the sustained rhythmic seizure-like signature.",
        "Observation (global low-frequency emphasis): Across the whole sample the STFT energy is concentrated in the bottom portion of the spectrogram (below ~0.2 on the plotted frequency axis) and the SHAP map highlights that same low-frequency band as positive (red) over multiple time windows. -> Implication: The model strongly associates low-frequency, sustained energy with the epilepsy label; low-frequency rhythmic motion is a primary discriminative feature in this dataset.",
        "Observation (volatility and rate of change): The model-positive windows (red SHAP) correspond to intervals where the signal alternates rapidly but regularly (high short-term variability around a steady mean ~1.5\u20132.5). In contrast, intervals with erratic, isolated spikes (high instantaneous change rate but low periodic structure) are either neutral or negatively weighted. -> Implication: The classifier emphasizes regular, repetitive volatility (periodic jerking) rather than single high-gradient events; regularity + persistence matters more than isolated extreme slopes.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 18\u201337): A sharp, high-amplitude transient beginning from a local minimum \u22480.5 at t\u224818 and rising to a peak \u22484.0\u20134.1 by t\u224828\u201332 (rise \u22483.5 units over ~10\u201314 steps; average slope ~0.25\u20130.35 units/step). The waveform here is a single large, smooth peak with relatively low high-frequency jitter. -> Implication: The model attributes this early large low-frequency excursion positively to the 'EPILEPSY' label (red in SHAP). The STFT shows concentrated energy at the lowest frequency bins during this interval, indicating a slow, high-energy movement burst consistent with the start or an isolated phase of a seizure-mimic rather than repetitive high-frequency motion (e.g., running).",
        "Observation (t \u2248 38\u201355): Rapid decay after the first peak back down to a trough near 0.6\u20131.0 (drop \u22483.5 units over ~12\u201317 steps), producing a sharp falling edge and brief low-amplitude valley. -> Implication: This fast negative slope creates a clear half-cycle (peak \u2192 trough) and contributes to low-frequency content (STFT shows continuing low-frequency power), reinforcing the rhythmic slow oscillatory signature that the classifier uses for epilepsy detection.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 55\u2013112): A sustained plateau of elevated values between \u22482.7 and \u22483.4 lasting ~55 steps. Within this interval there are small, slow modulations (amplitude \u00b10.2\u20130.4) rather than high-frequency jitter; the signal shows low volatility compared with the early transient (gentle undulations around a high baseline). -> Implication: SHAP marks much of this interval as positively contributing. The STFT confirms persistent power concentrated at the lowest frequency bands across this window, indicating prolonged low-frequency rhythmic activity (multi-second cycles) \u2014 a hallmark of the simulated seizure segment (sustained rhythmic movement) rather than short impulsive gestures.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 74\u201395, substructure): Within the sustained plateau there is a noticeable local rise around t\u224880\u201392 (from \u22482.8 to \u22483.3) producing a shallow sub-peak and then returning to the plateau baseline. -> Implication: The SHAP heatmap shows particularly strong positive values aligned with this sub-peak and the STFT shows slightly increased energy across the low-to-mid frequency band (0.05\u20130.15 normalized), suggesting the classifier uses both sustained high baseline and its internal slow modulations to strengthen the epilepsy prediction.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 112\u2013132): A pronounced monotonic decline from \u22483.2 down to a deep trough \u22480.2 (decline \u22483.0 units over ~20 steps; average slope \u2248-0.15 units/step), producing a slow falling envelope with low high-frequency content. -> Implication: The sudden loss of sustained low-frequency energy (confirmed by STFT drop) corresponds to a reduction in positive SHAP contribution after this window; temporally this could represent seizure termination in the simulated protocol and the classifier relies on the contrast between pre- and post-decline behavior.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 132\u2013155): Rapid rebound from the trough to a moderate peak \u22482.4\u20132.6 (rise \u22482.2\u20132.4 units over ~18\u201322 steps), with a somewhat steeper ascent and higher short-term volatility than the earlier plateau (visible small oscillations on the rising edge). -> Implication: This recovery contains low-frequency content but is less consistently rhythmic than the earlier plateau; SHAP values in this window are mixed/weak positive, indicating the classifier treats it as partial evidence but weaker than the earlier sustained rhythmic interval.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 160\u2013190): A second large amplitude cluster: a steep climb starting near t\u2248160 (\u22481.0) to a local high \u22483.8\u20133.9 around t\u2248175\u2013185, followed by a gradual decline to \u22482.2\u20133.0 by the series end. This cluster is sharp but composed of a broad single crest rather than many small repeated cycles. -> Implication: Although visually large, SHAP shows this late cluster as neutral-to-negative (blue in some low-frequency bins) for 'EPILEPSY' in the heatmap. The STFT shows low-frequency energy but a different temporal shape (single broad event rather than a sustained rhythmic sequence), so the model appears to downgrade its epileptic evidence \u2014 likely because seizure-mimic in this dataset is expected as a sustained rhythmic 30s segment, and an isolated later crest does not match that temporal signature as well.",
        "Observation (Frequency domain overall): Across the positively attributed windows (especially t\u224818\u201337 and t\u224855\u2013112) the STFT shows concentrated energy in the very low-frequency bins (normalized 0.0\u20130.15 ~ up to ~2.4 Hz), with little energy at higher frequencies across the whole sample. -> Implication: The classifier's SHAP attributions align with increased low-frequency power and prolonged low-frequency rhythmicity as the primary discriminative cue for the epilepsy label (consistent with sustained slow oscillatory wrist motions used to simulate seizures).",
        "Observation (t \u2248 18\u201355): The signal climbs from near 0 (crossing from ~-0.6 at t\u22480) to a sustained high plateau. Amplitude rises to a peak \u2248 +1.2\u2013+1.4 (largest positive values) and then oscillates mildly around 1.0\u20131.3. Volatility is low in this window: short-term fluctuations are small (peak-to-trough \u2248 0.1\u20130.3). The STFT shows concentrated energy at the lowest frequency band during this interval (bright band near 0 Hz). The SHAP heatmap shows positive attribution at low frequencies for these time steps (red). -> Implication: A sustained, smooth positive offset / slow, low-frequency component (large DC/low-frequency energy) is treated by the classifier as evidence for the epilepsy class. In practical terms this likely corresponds to a prolonged, relatively steady movement or posture-related acceleration before the primary event (pre-ictal or preparatory motion), which the model associates positively with the seizure-mimicking label.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 70\u201398): A pronounced, relatively rapid downward transition: the signal falls from about +1.0 at t\u224870 to around -0.5 to -1.0 by t\u224895. Net change is \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6 units across ~25 time steps (average slope \u2248 -0.05 to -0.06 units/step). Superimposed on the downward trend are small transient rebounds (brief local upticks) but the dominant shape is a steep monotonic decline. STFT still shows energy concentrated in the very low-frequency bins at the time of the transition, and SHAP marks this region with strong positive attribution at low frequencies (bright red near t\u224893). -> Implication: The classifier strongly uses the large slow downward transition (a sharp trend reversal) as a marker. In a physiological interpretation this resembles a sudden collapse/transition in movement state (onset of ictal activity) \u2014 a salient event that discriminates seizure-like records from other activities.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 100\u2013125): Deep trough followed by large-amplitude oscillatory rebounds. The minimum occurs near t\u2248115\u2013120 at approximately -1.5 to -1.6. Following the trough the signal exhibits relatively large swings (approx. -1.6 up to -0.5), with higher short-term volatility (peak-to-trough of swings \u2248 0.8\u20131.1) and several prominent local extrema. STFT shows low-frequency energy but also relatively stronger mid-low frequency content during portions of this interval; SHAP shows red attribution across low-mid frequencies here as well. -> Implication: High-amplitude, irregular oscillations after a pronounced trough are interpreted as characteristic of the epileptic (mimicked seizure) episode \u2014 consistent with convulsive or jerking-like motion in the wrist data that the model picks up as positive evidence.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 125\u2013205): Sustained, quasi-periodic oscillatory activity of moderate amplitude. From t\u2248130 onward the waveform cycles repeatedly between roughly -1.4 and -0.6 with a semi-regular period on the order of ~12\u201325 steps (roughly a few cycles across this window). Amplitude of these cycles is moderate (~0.4\u20130.8), shapes are rounded/triangular rather than sharp spikes, and volatility is moderate (more variability than the early plateau but less than the abrupt trough-to-rebound). STFT shows intermittent low-frequency bursts concentrated at the bottom frequency band during these times; SHAP displays positive attribution across these low-frequency rows at many of these time indices. -> Implication: The classifier treats ongoing rhythmic/oscillatory motion after the transition as supporting evidence for the seizure label \u2014 a sustained tremor-like or rhythmic jerking signature in the wrist accelerometer that is characteristic of the mimicked seizure examples in the dataset.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u201318): Initial small negative-to-positive ramp with limited amplitude (starts around -0.6 and moves toward 0 and then towards positive by t\u224818). There is a localized blue (negative) SHAP patch at the lowest frequency near t\u224818. STFT energy at the lowest frequencies is low to moderate early on. -> Implication: The early small negative offset and brief low-frequency dip are interpreted by the model as weak counter-evidence (negative SHAP) for the seizure label. In other words, the classifier slightly discounts segments where the signal has the brief low-frequency characteristics that do not match the seizure template (e.g., a transient dip rather than sustained high/transition features)."

      "pattern": [
        "Overall pattern of Sample 1 (temporal decomposition):",
        "1) Quiet baseline (time \u2248 0\u201355): low amplitude (\u2248-5.2 to -4.3), low volatility, slow upward drift. This period contributes little to the positive classification signal.",
        "2) First seizure-like transient (time \u2248 70\u201380): a sharp, high-amplitude upward spike from \u2248-4.0 to \u2248-1.45, rapid rise (~+0.17\u20130.19 units/step) and moderately fast fall (~-0.15 units/step). Generates low-to-mid low-frequency energy and moderate SHAP importance (mid-low freq band).",
        "3) Short rebound (\u224880\u201395): a quick drop to \u2248-4.0 producing alternating slopes that increase transient content (adds to the low-frequency transient signature).",
        "4) Second seizure-like transient and tonic plateau (\u2248100\u2013135): another abrupt spike up to \u2248-1.45, followed by a sustained elevated plateau (\u2248-1.5 to -2.5) lasting \u224815\u201325 steps, then a slow decline. This segment shows the strongest positive attribution in SHAP at 0 Hz (very low-frequency energy) and in the STFT as concentrated low-frequency power.",
        "5) Recovery/decay (\u2248135\u2013167): gradual decline in baseline from plateau down to \u2248-3.6 with reduced volatility; contributes positive SHAP at 0 Hz but less mid-frequency energy.",
        "6) Late small fluctuations and partial recovery (\u2248167\u2013205): moderate amplitude oscillations around \u2248-3.6 to -2.4 with small upward moves and local variability but no sharp repeated spikes like the mid-section.",
        "",
        "Frequency/temporal dependence and relation between features:",
        "- Dominant discriminative components are low-frequency and step-like (DC/near-DC shifts) plus two abrupt transient spikes. The STFT confirms most energy at ~0 Hz with intermittent low-frequency bursts (~0.08\u20130.2 Hz) at the times of spikes.",
        "- Temporal dependence: the presence of two separated high-amplitude spikes followed by a sustained elevated state forms a sequence (spike \u2192 rebound \u2192 spike \u2192 plateau \u2192 slow decay) that the classifier maps to the epilepsy class. Earlier quiet baseline and later smaller fluctuations provide contextual contrast but are not driving the classification.",
        "",
        "Why these patterns support the EPILEPSY label given dataset background:",
        "- In this dataset the epilepsy class corresponds to mimicked seizures that contain sudden, large-amplitude jerks and subsequent tonic-like sustained movement/posture. The observed sharp transients, large amplitude (approx +2.5 to +2.9 unit jumps), and following sustained elevated baseline match that expected seizure-mimicking temporal structure, and the model's SHAP attribution emphasizes those low-frequency (tonic) and transient features rather than steady rhythmic motion (as would be expected for walking/running or repeated sawing).",
        "Overall pattern of Sample 2 (Epilepsy): Three linked phases + spectral signature.",
        "Phase A \u2014 Ictal-like burst phase (approx. time 0\u2013~100): High-amplitude, high-volatility spike train with frequent sharp peaks (up to ~6.5\u20136.8) and rapid changes (multiple units per time step). STFT: pronounced low-frequency energy with intermittent mid-frequency bursts (~relative 0.1\u20130.25). This phase provides the strongest positive evidence for the epilepsy label (many red SHAP cells concentrated here).",
        "Phase B \u2014 Transitional trough and rebound (approx. time ~90\u2013115): A sharp V-shaped trough down to ~0.9 followed by a relatively rapid recovery to an elevated plateau (~4.0\u20134.6). This transient marks a change in movement dynamics (end or reorganization of jerks) and produces mixed but overall positive attribution in the model.",
        "Phase C \u2014 Post-ictal/slower oscillation phase (approx. time ~115\u2013207): Lower volatility, smoother undulations (amplitude ~1.8\u20134.0), slow rises and falls, and concentrated energy at the lowest frequency. Patches within this phase still contribute positively to the epilepsy classification, representing residual or slow rhythmic motor activity.",
        "Cross-feature dependence: The classifier\u2019s decision seems to depend on the co-occurrence of (1) intense, short-term high-amplitude bursts (temporal spikes), and (2) sustained low-frequency power (baseline/slow oscillation). Where both are present (early\u2013mid times), SHAP shows strong positive attribution. Where the signal becomes quiet or features a deep trough, attribution becomes negative or reduced.",
        "Comparison across time: Early period (0\u2013100) is distinguished by higher amplitude and volatility and richer mid-frequency content compared with later times where amplitude and volatility fall and low-frequency power dominates. The model uses these contrasts (amplitude level, volatility, and spectral composition) to differentiate the seizure-like epoch from other class patterns (running/sawing/walking).",
        "Overall pattern for this sample: Dominant low-frequency rhythmic activity (occurs primarily between time steps \u224810 and \u2248110) characterized by repeated cycles of large amplitude (peaks \u22483\u20133.8, troughs \u22480.4\u20131.5) and asymmetric cycle shapes (fast rise, slower decay). This rhythmic band is persistent (tens of samples long) rather than a short transient, and it aligns with strong positive SHAP attribution and high STFT energy in the bottom spectral band.",
        "Secondary pattern: Intermittent non-rhythmic transients (notably around time steps \u2248140\u2013160) are present \u2014 sharp negative spikes of short duration that break the rhythmic structure. These events correspond to negative SHAP values and reduce the model's epilepsy evidence. Thus the time series is a combination of sustained rhythmic structure (positive evidence) interspersed with isolated artifacts (negative evidence).",
        "Temporal dependence and combination: The classifier appears to require both spectral (low-frequency energy) and temporal persistence (oscillations maintained across many cycles). Positive classification arises when low-frequency spectral energy and consistent periodic morphology co-occur over extended windows; isolated high-magnitude deviations without periodic context are down-weighted. In short, sustained, regular low-frequency oscillations -> strong epilepsy signal; isolated abrupt spikes -> counter-evidence.",
        "The feature pattern of Sample 0 is: Early transient peak (t\u224818\u201337) (large amplitude sharp rise to \u22484.1, low-frequency dominant) + Sustained high baseline with slow internal modulations (t\u224855\u2013112) (moderate-high amplitude \u22482.7\u20133.4, low volatility, persistent low-frequency energy) + Termination trough (t\u2248112\u2013132) (monotonic slow decline to \u22480.2) + Rebound moderate event (t\u2248132\u2013155) (partial recovery, mixed evidence) + Secondary late high crest (t\u2248160\u2013190) (large amplitude but different morphology, lower positive attribution).",
        "Overall characteristics and temporal dependence: The series is dominated by low-frequency, large-amplitude components rather than rapid high-frequency oscillations. Significant events occur in clusters: a pronounced early spike leading into a prolonged rhythmic plateau (these together form a contiguous epoch of elevated low-frequency energy), then a clear decay and recovery sequence followed by a later isolated crest. The classifier appears to rely on (a) presence of sustained low-frequency power over many consecutive time steps, and (b) the rhythmic consistency (plateau with slow modulations) within that interval. Abrupt slopes (both rise and fall) and sustained energy windows provide strong temporal context \u2014 the early spike + plateau act together as a multi-step pattern that increases epilepsy probability, while isolated later peaks without the same sustained rhythmic envelope reduce or do not increase that probability as much.",
        "Relationship to dataset background (why label = EPILEPSY): In this dataset seizures were simulated as controlled, sustained rhythmic movement episodes about 30 seconds long. The dominant low-frequency energy and the long-lasting elevated amplitude window (t\u224855\u2013112) match that expected seizure-mimic signature. The model's SHAP heatmap highlights these low-frequency, sustained windows as positive evidence, which explains the classification into the epilepsy label rather than other activities (running/walking tend to show more continuous periodic high-frequency components or repeated cycles, sawing would present different frequency/content patterns).",
        "Overall pattern: Pre-onset elevated plateau (t\u224818\u201355) + abrupt downward transition (t\u224870\u201398) + deep trough with large rebounds (t\u2248100\u2013125) + sustained quasi-periodic tremor-like oscillations (t\u2248125\u2013205).",
        "Trend and level: The series shows an overall piecewise structure \u2014 an initial smooth upward shift to a high positive level, a relatively sharp negative slope (transition), then a sustained negative offset with oscillatory activity. The dominant long-timescale variations are low-frequency (STFT concentrated near 0 Hz), producing clear DC/slow-trend signatures.",
        "Periodicity and volatility: There is little short-term high-frequency content overall; instead the series contains mid/low-frequency cyclic components after the transition. Volatility is low during the initial plateau, maximal during the trough-and-rebound segment (t\u2248100\u2013125), and moderate afterwards when rhythm-like cycles persist. The oscillatory activity post-transition has a quasi-periodic recurrence (approximate cycle length \u2248 12\u201325 time steps) but with variable amplitude and irregular timing, consistent with convulsive-like jerks rather than a strict sinusoidal periodic motion.",
        "Time-dependence / combination: The classifier appears to rely on the temporal sequence: a sustained elevated phase followed by a sharp downward transition and then sustained irregular oscillations. Each element reinforces the epileptic label \u2014 the plateau signals preparatory/steady movement, the abrupt trend reversal marks event onset, and the post-onset oscillations provide continued evidence. Isolated occurrences of any single element (for example a short oscillation without the preceding transition) would likely be less decisive; the combination and ordering (plateau \u2192 drop \u2192 oscillation) is salient.",
        "Relation to dataset background and label: Given that the epilepsy class in this dataset corresponds to mimicked seizures (a short pre-event period, a 30 s seizure, then post event), the observed sequence (steady motion \u2192 abrupt transition \u2192 large irregular oscillations) matches the expected temporal structure of a simulated seizure event. The model\u2019s SHAP attributions concentrated on low-frequency bands confirm it is primarily detecting slow trend changes and sustained low-frequency oscillatory energy associated with the simulated seizure motion rather than high-frequency rhythmic activity typical of e.g. sawing or running."

        "Observation (mid-sequence low-frequency hotspot, SHAP red): Strong positive SHAP values concentrate between time steps ~37 and ~93 at normalized frequency ~0.08\u20130.11 (STFT). -> Implication: The classifier relies on a sustained low-frequency oscillation in this interval as evidence for the assigned class (label 1 = RUNNING). The STFT maps that frequency band to ~1.3\u20131.8 Hz (0.08\u20130.11 * 16 Hz sampling), consistent with repetitive arm/leg swing cadence during running.",
        "Observation (corresponding waveform, t\u224837\u201393): The waveform shows regular cycles with narrow, sharp positive peaks around +0.8 to +1.1 and deeper negative troughs around \u22122.0 to \u22122.8. Each cycle rises quickly (1\u20133 time steps) to the peak and then falls steeply into a wider negative trough before recovering. -> Implication: The classifier is likely using the combination of (a) alternating large amplitude swings and (b) asymmetric cycle shape (fast positive spike + deeper negative trough) as a characteristic running signature rather than a smooth sinusoid.",
        "Observation (periodicity/spacing): Peak-to-peak spacing in the highlighted mid-sequence region is roughly 10\u201313 samples. With fs = 16 Hz this corresponds to a period \u22480.75\u20130.8 s (\u22481.25\u20131.33 Hz). STFT energy at the same band confirms a dominant fundamental near 1.3\u20131.6 Hz. -> Implication: The model uses the regular, sustained cadence (frequency) characteristic of running strides rather than higher-frequency tremor or isolated events.",
        "Observation (amplitude stability / volatility): Within the SHAP-red window the cycle amplitudes are fairly consistent (moderate amplitude modulation only), producing a steady band of STFT power across time in the 0.08\u20130.11 normalized-frequency row. -> Implication: The classifier favors persistent, stable periodic motion over transient spikes; sustained power in the low-frequency band increases positive contribution to the running label.",
        "Observation (early transient, SHAP small-to-moderate red near t\u224818\u201337): At ~18\u201337 there is a strong isolated positive peak (~+1.1) immediately followed by the largest negative trough in the whole series (~\u22123.4 around t\u224825). In the STFT this interval shows a burst of broadband low-frequency energy and SHAP shows some positive contribution there as well. -> Implication: This transient likely corresponds to the moment of transition into running (a strong arm thrust or acceleration). The model treats such a start-up burst plus entry into periodic motion as supporting evidence for running.",
        "Observation (later minor red at t\u2248130 and other sparse red cells near 0.08\u20130.12 freq): Smaller positive SHAP patches recur later (~t\u2248130 and intermittently) at the same low-frequency band; the waveform there continues the same regular asymmetric cycles but sometimes with slightly reduced peak amplitude (~+0.7 to +0.9) and slightly shallower troughs. -> Implication: Reappearance of the same spectral-temporal pattern continues to reinforce the running prediction; the model integrates repeated confirmations of the cadence across time.",
        "Observation (shape/substructure detail within each cycle): Each cycle shows a steep upward edge to a narrow positive apex, followed by a sharper downward slope into a wider negative valley then a slower return toward baseline. The STFT shows the fundamental plus some low-order harmonic content (visible as weaker energy at ~0.16 normalized frequency). -> Implication: The asymmetry and presence of harmonic content (not purely sinusoidal) are used as discriminative features\u2014symmetric low-frequency motion (e.g., slow walking) or high-frequency repetitive micro-motions (e.g., sawing) would present different harmonic signatures.",
        "Observation (baseline / pre-motion window): Before ~t\u224818 the trace sits near \u22121 with low-amplitude noise; STFT there shows little concentrated energy and SHAP is near-zero or slightly negative. -> Implication: Quiescent baseline does not support the running label; the classifier focuses on the subsequent onset and steady periodic motion to make its positive decision.",
        "Observation (time steps 55\u2013111 \u2248 3.4\u20136.9 s): Repeated, high\u2011amplitude, highly regular cycles. Each cycle shows a fast upward swing to a positive peak around +1.0 to +1.2 (peak reached within ~1\u20133 samples), immediately followed by a rapid fall into a deep negative trough around -2.0 to -2.6 (trough lasting ~2\u20135 samples). Measured cycle period is \u22489\u201311 samples (\u22480.56\u20130.69 s) -> frequency \u22481.45\u20131.8 Hz. STFT: strong, narrowband energy centered at normalized frequency ~0.10 (\u22481.6 Hz) with visible harmonic energy near ~0.18\u20130.20. SHAP: strong positive attribution (red) concentrated on this frequency band and this time window. -> Implication: This middle segment contains the prototypical rhythmic, high\u2011energy oscillation the model uses to predict the RUNNING class \u2014 consistent, periodic arm/wrist swings with a sharp acceleration profile and harmonic content from the sharp waveform.",
        "Observation (time steps 0\u201337 \u2248 0\u20132.3 s): Lower overall amplitude and higher irregularity. Peaks are smaller (roughly +0.3 to +1.0) and troughs are less consistently deep; STFT shows less concentrated energy in the 0.1 band and relatively more low\u2011frequency content. SHAP in this early window shows weak or slightly negative attribution (blue at lowest frequencies). -> Implication: The beginning of the sample is less representative of running and may slightly oppose the running classification; the model places less weight on this initial irregular interval when deciding the class.",
        "Observation (time steps 130\u2013186 \u2248 8.1\u201311.6 s): Amplitude modulation and occasional isolated large events. The regular cycle amplitude tends to decrease slightly and volatility increases (more variability in peak/trough heights). A few isolated large positive peaks (notably around time steps ~167\u2013186) are visible and STFT shows a burst of low\u2011frequency energy there. SHAP around those late time steps is mixed/weakly positive. -> Implication: This interval represents a transient change in cadence or a short acceleration/deceleration \u2014 the model still relies primarily on the earlier sustained rhythmic band but gives some additional positive weight to these late transient bursts.",
        "Observation (per\u2011cycle substructure across middle window): Each oscillation is asymmetric: a very rapid rise (sharp leading edge), a short plateau or small notch at the absolute peak in some cycles, then a deeper, more prolonged negative undershoot. STFT harmonic content (energy at ~0.18\u20130.20 normalized) supports the presence of sharper edges (non\u2011sinusoidal waveform). -> Implication: The sharp asymmetric cycle shape (fast acceleration + slower deceleration/undershoot) is a discriminative transient feature (produces harmonics) that helps the classifier differentiate running from smoother repetitive activities (e.g., slow walking or sawing).",
        "Observation (overall frequency signature): Dominant spectral energy is concentrated at the ~0.10 normalized frequency (\u22481.6 Hz) across the central time region, with secondary energy at ~0.18\u20130.20 (harmonic). There is lower but present energy near DC/very-low-frequency components (baseline shifts) across the sample. SHAP shows red concentrated at the main spectral band (~0.10) and some red at low frequencies during parts of the series. -> Implication: The classifier uses the sustained narrowband at \u22481.6 Hz and its harmonics as primary evidence for RUNNING, with lower\u2011frequency cues providing supplementary information about pace changes or transitions.",
        "Observation (temporal dependence and persistence): The regular cycles repeat with consistent period and phase alignment over many consecutive cycles (dozens of cycles across the central window), producing a persistent, stable oscillatory pattern rather than isolated spikes. -> Implication: The model attributes significance to the persistence of the rhythmic pattern (sustained oscillation) \u2014 sustained periodicity is characteristic of running in this dataset and distinguishes it from short, isolated gestures or irregular seizure\u2011mimicking movements.",
        "Observation: Strong, regularly spaced positive peaks between approximately time steps 74 and 130 (centered around ticks 93 and 111). Peaks reach about +0.9 to +1.1 on the normalized axis and are followed by deep negative valleys down to about -2.0 to -2.8. The rise from valley to peak occurs within a few samples (steep slope), producing narrow, sharp crests and broader negative troughs. STFT: this same time window shows strong energy in the low-frequency band (~0.08\u20130.12 normalized frequency) and a secondary band near ~0.18\u20130.20. -> Implication: A strongly periodic, high-amplitude oscillation is present in this mid-series window. The sharp-up / slower-down cycle shape (narrow positive spike then broader negative trough) and the spectral peaks at a fundamental and harmonic are characteristic of repetitive arm-swing or impact-like motions produced during running. This region is a major positive contributor to the model predicting the RUNNING label (matches the red SHAP region).",
        "Observation: A smaller red-attributed band appears earlier, roughly between time steps ~18 and ~37. In the raw trace this corresponds to the first appearance of larger-amplitude oscillations: a sudden change from the initial low-variance baseline into larger swings, with one or two pronounced positive spikes (~+1.0) and deeper negative dips (~-2.0). STFT: increased low-frequency energy begins here. -> Implication: This early burst marks the transition from a quiet baseline to the steady rhythmic pattern. The model treats this transition as evidence toward the running class (start of the repetitive pattern).",
        "Observation: Throughout the central and later portions (approx 37 to 205) the waveform shows very consistent periodicity: inter-peak intervals of about 16\u201320 samples (visually ~18 samples between successive large positive spikes; ticks on the plot support ~18-sample spacing). STFT: consistent, narrow-band peaks at the same low-frequency locations across time. -> Implication: High autocorrelation and stable periodicity indicate a repetitive locomotor signal (steady cadence). The stability of period and persistent spectral energy are strong discriminative cues for running versus non-rhythmic activities.",
        "Observation: Volatility (peak-to-trough amplitude) increases abruptly after the initial region (past ~37). The mid-section oscillations show a range of ~3 units (peak to valley), while the initial 0\u201330 region fluctuates within roughly 0.2\u20130.6 units around -1.0. -> Implication: The sudden increase in amplitude and volatility is consistent with onset of vigorous movement (running) rather than lower-intensity activities (walking or seated seizure mimic), making mid-section amplitudes an important positive signal for the classifier.",
        "Observation: Substructure of each cycle: a fast, steep upward edge (few-sample rise) to a narrow positive crest, then a somewhat slower descent into a deeper negative trough often lasting more samples than the crest. This asymmetry is repeated across cycles. -> Implication: The asymmetric cycle (sharp forward swing / impact-like peak and slower reversal) likely corresponds to wrist kinematics during running (rapid forward arm swing and slower backward return). The classifier uses this shape as a discriminative temporal fingerprint.",
        "Observation: STFT shows not only a consistent low-frequency fundamental band (~0.08\u20130.12 normalized freq) but also energy at a higher low-frequency band (~0.18\u20130.20), visible across the mid-series windows. -> Implication: Presence of harmonic content (fundamental + harmonic) supports a relatively forceful periodic motion with non-sinusoidal waveform (consistent with running arm swings that produce harmonics). The model's positive SHAP at those frequency/time bins confirms the classifier finds this spectral pattern indicative of running.",
        "Observation: Later in the series (after ~149) amplitude and trough depth show mild variability: some cycles have deeper negative valleys (e.g., around ticks 167 and 186) and occasional slight reductions in crest height. SHAP in these later bins is mixed (some red, some light blue). -> Implication: Natural stride-to-stride variability (variations in arm swing amplitude or brief changes in cadence) is present but does not negate the overall running signature. The model still attributes positive weight to the recurring cycles even if individual cycles vary.",
        "Observation: The very first segment (time steps 0\u201318) is a low-amplitude baseline centered near -1.0 with minor jitter; STFT energy is low there and SHAP shows mixed to slightly negative contribution at some low-frequency bins. -> Implication: This initial quiet segment is not supporting the running prediction and is likely treated as neutral or slightly negative evidence by the classifier; the predictive decision relies on the subsequent rhythmic, high-amplitude sections.",
        "Observation: Strong positive SHAP region centered at normalized frequency ~0.08\u20130.12 (STFT row near 0.1) between time steps \u224855\u2013130 (ticks 55 to 130). The raw trace in that interval (t\u224855\u2013130) shows highly regular, high-amplitude oscillations with peak values near +1.0 to +2.2 and troughs near \u22121.0 to \u22121.3. -> Implication: A dominant periodic component (~0.1 normalized \u2192 ~1.6 Hz actual) in this middle interval is a primary positive contributor to the model decision; this sustained, large-amplitude rhythmic oscillation is characteristic of running cadence and the model relies on it to assign the RUNNING label.",
        "Observation: Positive SHAP also appears at a higher normalized frequency band around ~0.16\u20130.21 (STFT row near 0.18) primarily between t\u224818\u201393. The STFT shows consistent energy in this band concurrent with the main band. -> Implication: The presence of energy at a harmonic (or second prominent band) suggests a multimodal spectral signature (fundamental + harmonic) typical of repetitive, impact-like motions (arm/wrist acceleration harmonics during running). The model uses both the fundamental and harmonic energy to strengthen its RUNNING prediction.",
        "Observation: In the highlighted interval (t\u224855\u2013130) the waveform substructure is a rapid, sharp rise to each peak followed by an immediate descent to a negative trough (steep slopes on rise and fall). Individual cycles repeat with very consistent shape and inter-peak spacing (~10\u201312 samples). -> Implication: The consistent, sharp spike + trough substructure indicates periodic impacts/strikes (typical wrist accelerations during running). The model interprets this repeated, high slew-rate pattern as evidence for dynamic locomotion rather than slower or irregular movements (walking, sawing, or mimicked seizure).",
        "Observation: Early interval t\u22480\u201337 contains cycles as well but with slightly lower mean peak-to-trough amplitude and more variability in peak height; SHAP in those times is weaker/less red. -> Implication: Earlier cycles are supportive but less decisive \u2014 the model assigns greater weight to the middle interval where periodicity and amplitude are most stable, so classification confidence depends on sustained, consistent oscillations rather than isolated bursts.",
        "Observation: The SHAP heatmap shows comparatively neutral or slightly negative contributions at very low normalized frequencies (~0.0\u20130.03) across time, while strong positive contributions are concentrated in the mid-low normalized frequencies (~0.08\u20130.21). -> Implication: Low-frequency baseline or slow drift is not important (or may even oppose RUNNING prediction). The model focuses on mid-range periodic bands associated with stride/arm-swing frequencies rather than slow posture changes or baseline offsets.",
        "Observation: The STFT magnitude heatmap shows the dominant energy bands persist across time (not a single brief burst) \u2014 energy at ~0.1 and ~0.18 normalized is present across most time windows, with slight amplitude decay toward the end (t>167). -> Implication: The temporal persistence of these spectral components indicates a sustained activity (consistent running) rather than a transient event (like a brief seizure mimic or single sawing motion). The model uses the temporal continuity of these bands as evidence of sustained running.",
        "Observation: Cycle period estimated from inter-peak spacing (~10\u201312 samples) at 16 Hz sampling gives per-cycle time \u22480.62\u20130.75 s (frequency \u22481.33\u20131.6 Hz), consistent with brisk locomotor cadence rather than slow walking. -> Implication: The actual cadence estimate favors RUNNING over WALKING in the model because walking usually has lower step frequency; this numeric cadence information aligns with the SHAP-supported frequency bands used for classification.",
        "Observation: Local volatility (peak-to-trough difference) within the red SHAP interval is high but very regular (low variance of cycle amplitude across successive cycles). -> Implication: High but regular volatility is a signature of repetitive high-energy movements (running) and is treated positively by the model; irregular volatility (uneven bursts) would likely not produce the same positive SHAP pattern.",
        "Observation: Strong positive-attribution region in the SHAP heatmap concentrated at frequencies \u22480.08\u20130.12 (y-axis) and time steps approximately 74\u2013111 (x-axis). In the time series plot this corresponds to a sustained block of high-amplitude, rhythmic oscillations beginning just before t\u224874 and continuing through t\u2248111. The oscillation peaks reach about +1.7 to +2.2 and troughs reach about -1.3 to -1.0 in the same window; individual cycles are sharp, with fast rise and fall (steep slopes) and narrowly peaked crests. -> Implication: This localized, high-energy, periodic structure is the primary positive evidence for the RUNNING label. The combination of high amplitude, repeatable cycle shape (sharp positive peak followed by deep trough) and concentrated energy in a narrow low-frequency band strongly indicates a repetitive locomotor arm-swing signature (consistent with running) rather than irregular or low-amplitude motions.",
        "Observation: A preceding quieter segment (time steps 0\u201330) has a small positive SHAP presence at very low frequency (near 0.0 in STFT). The time-series level here is relatively flat around ~1.05\u20131.15 with only small variations (amplitude variance low, change rate small). -> Implication: This stable baseline contributes modestly and positively to the RUNNING classification (possibly representing a preparatory posture or pre-movement steady wrist offset before the onset of rhythmic running motion). It helps the classifier by providing contrast between baseline and subsequent rhythmic activity.",
        "Observation: Within the main rhythmic region (approx t\u224874\u2013111) the STFT shows concentrated spectral energy in the same narrow band (0.08\u20130.12) across that time span with only small energy leakage to adjacent frequencies. The time-domain cycles show consistent inter-peak spacing (repeatability) and only mild amplitude modulation across cycles. -> Implication: The repeatable periodicity + spectrally concentrated energy indicates a stable cyclic motion (consistent cadence), reinforcing the RUNNING decision via both time- and frequency-domain consistency.",
        "Observation: Local substructure inside the main positive block: each cycle has an asymmetric shape \u2014 a relatively fast ascending flank to a narrow/rounded positive peak, followed by a pronounced negative trough that returns toward the baseline within a few time steps. This asymmetry repeats each cycle. -> Implication: The asymmetric peak-trough substructure is characteristic of impact-like arm movement with a quick acceleration then deceleration, a signature more typical of running arm swings than smoother periodic activities (e.g., walking or sawing).",
        "Observation: A negative-attribution (blue) spot in the SHAP heatmap appears around time steps \u224830\u201345 at frequencies \u22480.16\u20130.20. In the plot this coincides with the moment when the signal abruptly transitions from the quiet baseline into the rhythmic oscillations and includes a single deep negative deflection (~ -1.2 at t\u224837) followed by rapid recovery. -> Implication: That brief irregular trough reduces evidence for RUNNING (classifier treats it as atypical compared to the canonical running cycles). Despite being negative locally, it is short-lived and overridden by the subsequent sustained positive rhythmic block, so it does not change the final label.",
        "Observation: Small positive SHAP patches are visible across many cycle centers within the main block (e.g., around t\u224893\u2013111 and again near t\u2248130\u2013149 but weaker). The time series shows similar cycle shapes there though with slight amplitude changes (some cycles marginally larger or smaller). -> Implication: Repeated occurrences of these positively-weighted cycles across the mid-to-late series increase cumulative evidence for RUNNING; the classifier integrates multiple similar cycles (temporal dependence) rather than relying on a single cycle.",
        "Observation: Toward the end of the series (t\u2248186\u2013205) there are light positive SHAP pixels in the same mid-low frequency band and the time series shows continued rhythmic peaks (amplitude slightly reduced relative to the mid-section but still pronounced, peaks ~1.1\u20131.9). -> Implication: Persistence of periodic activity toward the end provides additional supportive evidence that the rhythmic motion was not a transient artifact. The classifier uses this extended periodicity to strengthen the RUNNING classification.",
        "Observation: STFT image shows low-frequency energy near 0.0 (DC) at the start and distinct concentrated bands around 0.08\u20130.12 and weaker banding around ~0.18\u20130.2. The SHAP map highlights the 0.08\u20130.12 band in red (positive) while some ~0.18\u20130.2 components are blue (negative) at certain times. -> Implication: The classifier emphasizes the lower-frequency, stable cadence band as diagnostic of running while treating higher-frequency or off-cadence components as either neutral or negative. This selective frequency weighting explains why the sustained low-frequency periodic block is decisive for classification."

STFT shows a broadband low-frequency burst; SHAP gives a moderate positive contribution (supporting a movement onset interpretation).",
        "Feature 3 (~37\u201393): Dominant sustained periodic oscillation with sharp positive peaks (+0.8 to +1.1) and deep negative troughs (\u22122.0 to \u22122.8), cycle period ~10\u201313 samples (\u22480.75\u20130.8 s, ~1.25\u20131.33 Hz), and stable spectral power concentrated at normalized frequency 0.08\u20130.11 (~1.3\u20131.8 Hz). This region is the strongest positive contributor (red) in the SHAP heatmap and is the main basis for the running classification.",
        "Feature 4 (~93\u2013end): Continued repetitive asymmetric cycles with moderate amplitude modulation; intermittent positive SHAP patches indicate the classifier continues to reinforce the running label when the cadence and harmonic pattern persist.",
        "Temporal dependence and combination: The model appears to combine (a) an initial high-energy transient (movement onset), (b) sustained low-frequency power at ~1.3\u20131.8 Hz, and (c) repeated asymmetric cycle shapes with harmonic content. The concurrence of these elements across contiguous time windows yields a robust positive attribution toward RUNNING.",
        "Feature 1 (middle sustained rhythm; time steps 55\u2013111 \u2248 3.4\u20136.9 s): Strong, regular oscillations (peak +1.0\u2013+1.2, trough -2.0\u2013-2.6), period \u22489\u201311 samples (\u22480.56\u20130.69 s) -> manifests as a narrowband spectral peak at \u22481.6 Hz with harmonic content.

        "Feature 5 (persistence/time\u2011series dependence; overall): Long run of consecutive cycles with consistent period and amplitude over the central portion -> temporal persistence (not single outliers) is used by the classifier to confirm the RUNNING label.",
        "The feature pattern of Sample 96 is: Initial quiet baseline (time 0\u2013~30) (low amplitude around -1.0, low volatility) + Abrupt onset of regular, high-amplitude oscillations (time ~37 onward) (periodic cycles spaced \u224816\u201320 samples, narrow positive spikes \u2248+0.9\u20131.1 followed by broader negative troughs \u2248-2.0 to -2.8) + Strong spectral concentration in low-frequency bands (~0.08\u20130.12 normalized freq) with a consistent harmonic (~0.18\u20130.20) across the mid-series (STFT supports a persistent fundamental and harmonic) + Within-cycle asymmetry and steep rise rates (fast spike formation followed by slower decay) producing repeated, highly autocorrelated cycles + Mild stride-to-stride amplitude variability in the later portion (time >150) but overall persistent periodic structure. This combination (sudden increase in amplitude/volatility, stable inter-peak interval, asymmetric sharp-crested cycles, and harmonic spectral content) explains why the model attributes the mid-series red regions strongly toward the RUNNING label.",
        "Overall pattern: The time series is dominated by a sustained, regular oscillatory pattern across the full record with no long-term trend or drift. Manifestations: Repeating cycles with sharp rises to positive peaks (~+1.0 to +2.4) and symmetric/near-symmetric falls to negative troughs (~\u22121.3 to \u22121.0).",
        "Periodicity: Strong, stable periodicity with inter-peak spacing \u224810\u201312 samples (at 16 Hz sampling \u2192 cycle \u22480.62\u20130.75 s, fundamental \u22481.33\u20131.6 Hz). This periodicity is temporally persistent (present in early, middle, and late sections) though amplitude and sharpness are highest in the middle segment (t\u224855\u2013130).",
        "Spectral signature: Dominant spectral energy concentrated at normalized frequency ~0.08\u20130.12 (STFT), with a secondary prominent band at ~0.16\u20130.21 (harmonic). These bands are the main positive contributors in the SHAP heatmap, indicating they drive the model's decision.",
        "Volatility & shape: High peak-to-trough volatility but low cycle-to-cycle variance in the central region (regular amplitude), producing a consistent sawtooth-like/impulsive oscillation shape per cycle. Volatility slightly decreases toward the end of the sample (t>167), producing smaller peaks but preserved periodicity.",
        "Temporal dependence & combination: The classifier appears to rely on the combination of (1) sustained, strong energy at the fundamental periodic band (~0.1 normalized) + (2) co-occurring harmonic (~0.18\u20130.21) + (3) regular, high-amplitude impulse-like cycle shapes. These features co-occur principally in the middle time window (t\u224855\u2013130), which yields the strongest positive SHAP contributions and therefore the decisive evidence for the RUNNING label.",
        "Comparison across segments: Early (t\u22480\u201337) \u2014 periodic but slightly lower amplitude and more variability; Middle (t\u224855\u2013130) \u2014 highest amplitude, most regular cycles and strongest positive SHAP; Late (t>167) \u2014 periodicity maintained but amplitude mildly reduced, SHAP contributions smaller. The classifier weights the middle stable segment most heavily when assigning the label.",
        "Overall pattern of Sample 82: (0\u201330) Low-variance baseline around \u22481.05\u20131.15 with negligible high-frequency content (manifestation: stable offset; contributes weakly positive) + (\u224830\u201340) Brief irregular transition with a sharp negative deflection (manifestation: transient trough; locally negative SHAP) + (\u224840\u2013205, especially 74\u2013111) Dominant, sustained periodic block of large-amplitude, asymmetric cycles (manifestation: repeated sharp positive peaks to deep troughs with consistent inter-peak spacing and concentrated STFT energy around 0.08\u20130.12). The dominant block displays high volatility (large peak-to-trough amplitude), fast change rates within each cycle (steep slopes), consistent substructure across cycles (asymmetric peak then trough), and only mild amplitude modulation across time. Overall time-series dependence: the classifier uses temporal repetition (multiple similar cycles across mid-late windows) and spectral concentration (consistent low-frequency band) to form a robust decision in favor of RUNNING."

      "feature": [
        "Observation -> Implication 1: SHAP shows a strong red region between time steps ~149\u2013186 concentrated at the lower-to-mid frequency band (~0.10\u20130.15 on the STFT axis). In the raw trace (time steps 149\u2013186, i.e. \u22489.3\u201311.6 s) this corresponds to a sequence of very regular, high positive peaks (peak values \u2248 +2.1 to +2.5) and pronounced negative troughs (\u2248 \u22120.7 to \u22121.1). Each cycle in this window has a short, steep rise (large positive slope over 1\u20133 samples) and a comparably fast fall, producing sharp, high-contrast strokes. Implication: the classifier attributes positive weight to these high-amplitude, sharply periodic strokes in the late segment \u2014 a clear signature of repetitive hand/arm movement (consistent with sawing).",
        "Observation -> Implication 2: SHAP also highlights a smaller red region earlier (roughly time steps ~18\u201355) at a slightly higher normalized frequency band (~0.18\u20130.22). In the corresponding raw signal segment (\u22481.1\u20133.4 s) the waveform shows regular oscillations with moderately high peaks (\u2248+1.8 to +2.2) and troughs (\u2248\u22120.5 to \u22120.8), with cycle-to-cycle amplitude quite consistent. Implication: mid-segment periodic energy also contributes positively to the sawing label \u2014 the model is picking up repetitive mid-frequency strokes present from the start.",
        "Observation -> Implication 3: Across the strongly positive SHAP region (149\u2013186) the local volatility (peak-to-trough amplitude within a cycle) is higher than in earlier segments. The change rate (absolute derivative) around peaks is greater \u2014 transitions from baseline to peak occur in 1\u20132 samples, indicating abrupt accelerations. Implication: the classifier favors segments with both high within-cycle amplitude and fast transient changes (characteristic of repeated, forceful sawing motions), not just slow oscillations.",
        "Observation -> Implication 4: STFT shows persistent energy near the bottom frequency bin (near 0, visible as bright band at the bottom across many time steps) and concentrated mid-band energy around 0.18 in the earlier half, shifting a little lower (~0.12\u20130.14) in the latter half (where SHAP is strongest). In the time series this corresponds to a stable baseline plus a dominant rhythmic component whose main spectral peak slowly drifts downward in normalized frequency as the session progresses. Implication: the classifier uses both the presence of a rhythmic repeating component and its spectral location; a slight tempo/period modulation (frequency drift) combined with consistent amplitude is characteristic of the sawing activity in this sample.",
        "Observation -> Implication 5: The waveform substructure of individual cycles is asymmetric: relatively sharp positive excursions followed by slightly more rounded negative recoveries. This shape is visible throughout but is most pronounced in the SHAP-red late window. Implication: the model is sensitive not only to periodicity and amplitude, but to cycle shape (sharp stroke followed by return) as a discriminative feature for sawing versus other activities that tend to have more sinusoidal or more chaotic signatures.",
        "Observation -> Implication 6: There is a mild upward amplitude trend from the start toward the late segment (peaks gradually increase from ~1.7\u20131.9 to ~2.4\u20132.5). Simultaneously, the regularity (period-to-period timing) remains high. Implication: the combination of amplitude growth plus preserved period regularity increases the positive attribution \u2014 the model associates steady, intensifying rhythmic strokes with the sawing label.",
        "Observation -> Implication 7: No large broadband, irregular, high-frequency bursts or chaotic deflections are present; the series is dominated by narrowband, repeating structure. Implication: absence of erratic broadband activity (which would favor seizure/epilepsy in this dataset) lowers the probability of other classes and favors a repetitive movement class (sawing).",
        "Observation: Strong positive SHAP attribution concentrated at normalized frequency \u2248 0.17\u20130.20 and time steps roughly 18\u201375. The STFT shows a high, narrowband energy ridge at the same frequency band during this interval. On the raw trace the same interval (t \u2248 18\u201375) contains fast, regular oscillations with peak values up to \u2248 +1.8\u2013+2.2 and troughs down to \u2248 -1.2. Individual cycles repeat every \u2248 5\u20136 samples (consistent with a frequency near 0.18 in the STFT). -> Implication: The model attributes the sample strongly to class 2 because of a sustained, narrowband, mid-frequency periodic component present in this early-to-mid time window. This corresponds to a steady, rhythmic wrist motion (highly consistent with a sawing-like repetitive movement).",
        "Observation: Positive SHAP hotspots reappear around time steps \u2248 149\u2013170 at the same frequency band (0.17\u20130.20). The raw signal in this late window shows slightly larger peak amplitudes (peaks occasionally near +2.0) and similar trough depths (~-1.0 to -1.3) with the same ~5\u20136 sample period. -> Implication: Recurrent narrowband energy at the sawing frequency late in the series further increases the model's confidence for label 2 \u2014 the classifier is sensitive to repetition of the same rhythmic signature across separate segments of the recording.",
        "Observation: A concentrated positive SHAP region is also visible around time steps \u2248 55\u201395 (frequency band 0.16\u20130.19). The STFT magnitude here remains high and narrow. In the raw trace this mid-section shows consistent cycle shapes: rapid rise to a sharp positive peak followed by a quicker descent and a somewhat broader negative trough. -> Implication: The classifier uses both the persistence of the specific frequency band and the asymmetric cycle shape (sharper positive peaks, slightly broader negative troughs) as discriminative cues for the sawing class.",
        "Observation: Amplitude envelope behavior: across the series there is modest amplitude modulation \u2014 the earliest samples (0\u201318) show lower amplitude and a transient ramp-up into the stable oscillation; middle portions (18\u2013150) are steady in amplitude; last portion (150\u2013206) shows a modest increase and slightly more cycle-to-cycle variability. STFT amplitudes reflect this as small changes in spectral magnitude at the main band. -> Implication: The model favors segments where the rhythmic motion is sustained and of moderate-to-high amplitude; transient start-up (low amplitude) contributes less positively than sustained rhythmic segments.",
        "Observation: Within each cycle the signal transitions are steep: peak-to-trough changes occur within ~2\u20133 samples, indicating strong high-frequency content inside the dominant periodicity. The STFT shows the energy concentrated in a narrow band rather than spread continuously to very high frequencies. -> Implication: The classifier is sensitive not only to periodicity but to the sharpness of each stroke (rapid transitions), a characteristic of repetitive mechanical motions such as sawing where each stroke produces a sharp acceleration impulse.",
        "Observation: Low-frequency (near 0.0\u20130.05 normalized) SHAP cells are near-neutral or slightly positive in some windows, but do not show the strong red seen at \u22480.18. The raw signal has little slow drift; the mean is near zero for most of the series. -> Implication: Slow trends or DC offsets are not driving the classification; the decisive feature is the mid-frequency rhythmic energy.",
        "Observation: Some small negative SHAP (blue) spots near other frequencies/timepoints (e.g., ~0.25\u20130.35 in a few windows) correspond to brief deviations where the oscillation shape slightly departs from the canonical pattern (occasional double-peak or short amplitude dips). -> Implication: These deviations slightly reduce the classifier's confidence, indicating the model has a relatively precise template for the expected periodic shape and penalizes departures from it.",
        "Observation (time window t \u2248 55\u2013149, strongest at t \u2248 111\u2013149; corresponds to the red band in the SHAP heatmap at frequency \u2248 0.15\u20130.18): A sustained, highly regular oscillation with consistent cycle-to-cycle morphology. On the time plot this window shows repeating peaks around +0.6 to +1.0 and troughs around -1.8 to -2.3 (approximate), giving a peak-to-trough span on the order of ~2.4 to ~3.3 units. The waveform in each cycle is asymmetric: relatively rapid, sharp negative-going transitions to the trough and a slower recovery to the positive crest. Volatility is low inside this window (cycle amplitude and period remain stable), and the instantaneous change rate is relatively constant between cycles (steep slope down into troughs, gentler slope up). Implication: The model attributes positive evidence for the SAWING class to a sustained narrow-band rhythmic motion in this mid-segment \u2014 a repetitive motor pattern with consistent amplitude and an asymmetric cycle shape (fast downstroke / slower upstroke) that is characteristic of sawing-like wrist movement.",
        "Observation (sub-window t \u2248 74\u2013111): The same dominant rhythmic component is present but shows slightly higher spectral energy in the STFT (bright band), and SHAP values are positive across this interval as well. In the time plot the cycle amplitude is slightly more uniform (less short-term amplitude modulation) than earlier parts. Implication: This middle portion contributes strongly and stably to the classifier\u2019s positive decision; the model relies on the persistence and uniformity of the rhythm as evidence for the sawing activity.",
        "Observation (early window t \u2248 18\u201355): Oscillatory behavior is present but with marginally more cycle-to-cycle amplitude variability and occasional lower peaks (visible as shallower maxima and slightly varied trough depths). The STFT still shows the same frequency band but with slightly lower magnitude than the central window. SHAP shows weaker red (and some small blue spots) here. Implication: Early cycles are supportive but less diagnostic; the classifier favors the cleaner, more regular mid-section over the slightly noisier start.",
        "Observation (late window t \u2248 149\u2013205): The rhythmic oscillation continues but with modest transient deviations: at a few time steps the troughs are less deep and cycle symmetry shifts slightly (the steepness of the negative-going edge reduces). The STFT energy in the dominant band persists but sometimes weakens at the very end; SHAP red intensity decreases a bit relative to the central interval. Implication: Late small irregularities slightly reduce positive attribution, but the ongoing presence of the dominant frequency still supports the SAWING label overall.",
        "Observation (frequency-domain corroboration): STFT shows a narrow, persistent energy band centered at normalized frequency \u2248 0.15\u20130.18 throughout much of the record, with lower-energy content at very low frequency (near DC) and little broadband high-frequency energy. Implication: The classifier is using a narrow-band periodic component (roughly 2\u20133 Hz given 16 Hz sampling) as a key discriminative feature; this matches the repetitive sawing motion frequency range and explains the concentrated red SHAP band.",
        "Observation (shape/substructure within cycles): Individual cycles are not purely sinusoidal \u2014 they have a pronounced negative lobe (deep trough) and a rounded positive lobe. The negative edge is steeper than the positive edge. Implication: This asymmetric cycle shape (sharp return stroke, slower forward stroke) likely encodes the mechanical pattern of sawing and is used by the model in addition to pure frequency information.",
        "Observation (negative SHAP/blue zones): Small blue (negative) attribution appears at very low frequencies (near 0.0) around some time intervals (e.g., near t \u2248 130\u2013167), corresponding to slight baseline or slow drift fluctuations when present. In the time plot these map to only minor baseline shifts or transient amplitude suppression. Implication: These low-frequency drifts slightly decrease the model\u2019s confidence for SAWING when they occur, since a pure, regular oscillation is more typical of sawing than a signal dominated by slow drift.",
        "Observation: Strong localized positive SHAP activation (red) appears concentrated in the mid-frequency band around 0.20\u20130.23 (STFT) and in the low-frequency band near 0.0, primarily between time steps ~111\u2013149 (centered ~130\u2013140). -> Implication: The model is relying on a combination of a stable rhythmic component (mid-frequency) together with a low\u2011frequency baseline/envelope change in that time window to push the prediction toward label 2 (SAWING).",
        "Observation: In the plot, the time window t = 111\u2013149 shows a sustained sequence of high, regular peaks with a very slightly higher peak at ~128\u2013132 (peak amplitude \u2248 2.7\u20132.9) compared with surrounding cycles (typical peak amplitude \u2248 2.2\u20132.5). The troughs in the same window remain close to 0 or slightly negative (\u2248 \u22120.1 to \u22120.5). -> Implication: The positive SHAP contribution aligns with a transient amplitude boost (local envelope increase) on top of a stable oscillation; such a transient is distinctive and increases the model's confidence for the sawing class because it emphasizes repetitive, forceful strokes.",
        "Observation: The oscillation in the highlighted window is highly periodic with consistent cycle shape: a rapid rise to a narrow rounded peak, followed by a faster decline and a short negative undershoot before the next rise. The per-cycle peak-to-trough amplitude in the red region is typically ~2.2\u20132.6. -> Implication: This consistent, sharp-peaked cyclical waveform is characteristic of repetitive wrist motions (repeated strokes) rather than irregular or single-event motions, and the classifier uses that regular cycle shape to identify SAWING.",
        "Observation: The local change rate within each cycle (slope of rising edge) in the 111\u2013149 region is steep compared with the slow baseline; transitions between trough and peak occur over only a few time steps (fast transients). -> Implication: Fast transient slopes indicate quick repetitive movements (short-duration strokes) which are discriminative for sawing \u2014 the model gives positive weight to those steep intra-cycle slopes.",
        "Observation: STFT shows concentrated energy at the mid-frequency band (~0.20) across most of the series but with clearer, stronger magnitude in the 111\u2013149 interval (brighter band in STFT). There is also elevated energy at the near-zero (very low) frequency in roughly the same time window. -> Implication: The classification is driven by a dominant rhythmic frequency (periodic sawing rate) plus a low\u2011frequency modulation (slight envelope or baseline shift) during that interval; together these spectral signatures are typical of continuous repetitive actions (sawing) rather than transient events like a seizure mimic or running steps.",
        "Observation: Outside the red-attributed window (e.g., earlier windows around t = 18\u201393), the oscillation remains periodic but with slightly lower and more uniform amplitude (peaks ~2.1\u20132.4) and fewer high-magnitude transients. SHAP in those earlier windows is weaker (mix of light colors). -> Implication: The model treats the entire series as rhythmic, but gives extra positive weight to the interval with the larger amplitude/transient (111\u2013149); that interval is the most decisive evidence for SAWING.",
        "Observation: There is no sustained monotonic trend across the full series (no persistent drift up or down); volatility is dominated by the repeatable cycle-to-cycle oscillations, with only occasional amplitude modulation and one clear transient spike near t \u2248 128. -> Implication: The absence of long-term trend and the presence of steady periodic oscillations help distinguish this sample from activities with larger non-periodic trends (e.g., running with large baseline shifts) or from seizure-mimicking patterns that are less regularly periodic.",
        "Observation: The SHAP heatmap shows the strongest positive contribution concentrated at a specific frequency band and time interval rather than being diffuse across frequencies or times. -> Implication: The classifier is using localized spectral-temporal signatures (a particular rhythm and its transient amplitude increase) to make the SAWING decision; this explains why that mid-frequency rhythmic band during 111\u2013149 is most important.",
        "Observation (time steps 130\u2013170, ~8.12\u201310.63 s): The SHAP heatmap shows a strong red cluster concentrated at a mid-frequency band (~0.18\u20130.24 normalized freq) and at the very-low-frequency (near-DC) row. In the raw plot this time window contains very regular, high-amplitude oscillations with sharp positive peaks around 2.2\u20132.6 (normalized units) and negative troughs near -0.8 to -1.0. Individual cycles repeat every ~5 samples (period \u2248 0.31 s at 16 Hz), producing a steady, high-energy rhythmic pattern. -> Implication: The classifier attributes this persistent, high-energy mid-frequency oscillation and the accompanying small DC offset strongly and positively to the SAWING class. The regular cycle period, high peak-to-trough amplitude, and concentrated spectral energy are characteristic of rhythmic repetitive wrist motion (sawing).",
        "Observation (same window freq-axis DC / 0.0 row): The SHAP red also includes the DC (very-low-frequency) band at the same times. The signal during 130\u2013170 shows a small positive baseline bias superimposed on the oscillations (peaks sit above zero more often than equally around zero). -> Implication: The baseline offset (low-frequency energy) during the strong oscillatory segment is used by the model as additional evidence for the SAWING label, likely reflecting a consistent hand posture or drift that typically accompanies the repetitive sawing movement in the training data.",
        "Observation (time steps 0\u201320, ~0\u20131.25 s): There are small red patches at the lowest frequency band at the start of the series. The raw trace here shows early regular oscillations but slightly lower amplitude (peaks ~1.8\u20132.0) and somewhat noisier minima. -> Implication: Early presence of periodic motion and a slight DC component gives weak positive contribution to SAWING \u2014 interpreted as the onset of the repetitive action (beginning of sawing swings).",
        "Observation (time steps ~200\u2013206, ~12.5\u201312.9 s): Small red contribution at low frequency near the end of the series is visible. The raw plot shows the oscillatory pattern persists to the end with maintained amplitude. -> Implication: Continued repetition and maintained energy at the characteristic frequency reinforce the SAWING prediction (classifier recognizes sustained motion rather than transient spikes).",
        "Observation (time steps ~30\u201360 and some other intervals): SHAP shows blue (negative) patches in the same mid-frequency band at several earlier time windows (notably around time step ~37 and ~74). The raw waveform in those intervals has slightly reduced amplitude and occasional irregularities in cycle shape (one cycle may be less symmetric or slightly damped). -> Implication: These locally weaker, less-regular oscillatory segments decrease the model's confidence in SAWING. The model expects consistent amplitude and regular cycle shape for positive evidence; deviations are penalized.",
        "Observation (cycle morphology across series): Individual cycles are asymmetric: relatively broad/rounded positive peaks and narrower negative troughs (positive excursion often larger in magnitude and duration). Rate of change around peaks is steep (high instantaneous slope) and falls quickly into troughs. -> Implication: The asymmetric, sharp-peaked cycle shape with fast rise/fall is a discriminative substructure the model associates with sawing motion (distinct from smoother gait oscillations in walking or the broadband transient spikes of seizure-mimicking).",
        "Observation (time-frequency corroboration): The STFT image shows a clear, concentrated energy ridge near the same mid-frequency band across most of the series, with a marked brightness increase in the 130\u2013170 window and sustained high energy at the very-low-frequency row. -> Implication: The spectral concentration confirms the time-domain observation of a dominant, sustained periodic component; the classifier uses that concentrated spectral signature (narrow-band, repeated energy) to distinguish SAWING from classes with either broader spectra (seizure mimicking) or different dominant frequency/content (running/walking)."

        "The feature pattern of Sample 114 is: Repetitive rhythmic strokes throughout (global) + Early-to-mid segment (time steps ~18\u201355, \u22481.1\u20133.4 s) shows consistent mid-frequency oscillations with moderate amplitude (peaks \u2248+1.8\u20132.2) and steady period (manifestation: clear repeated cycles) that contribute positively to the sawing classification + Middle segment (\u224856\u2013130, \u22483.5\u20138.1 s) shows similar periodicity with slightly lower amplitude/variability (manifestation: continued cycles with modest volatility) + Late segment (\u2248149\u2013186, \u22489.3\u201311.6 s) shows the strongest discriminative signature: larger peak amplitudes (\u2248+2.1 to +2.5), deeper troughs (\u2248\u22120.7 to \u22121.1), increased within-cycle change rates (steep rises over 1\u20133 samples), and concentrated spectral energy shifted slightly lower in normalized frequency (~0.10\u20130.15) (manifestation: sharp, high-contrast strokes). Overall implication: the classifier relies on sustained, regular, narrowband oscillatory energy and the specific cycle shape/amplitude modulation \u2014 features consistent with repeated sawing motions as per the dataset background.",
        "The feature pattern of Sample 110 is: Persistent mid-frequency periodicity (~normalized f = 0.17\u20130.20, which maps to a real oscillation of roughly 2.8\u20133.0 Hz given the sensor sampling) occurring in multiple time segments (primary strong occurrence t\u224818\u201375, reinforced at t\u224855\u201395 and again at t\u2248149\u2013170) (manifestation: regular cycles every \u22485\u20136 samples, sharp positive peaks \u2248+1.5 to +2.2, troughs \u2248-1.3 to -0.9) + Amplitude envelope behavior (occurrence: start ramp-up t\u22480\u201318, stable mid amplitude t\u224818\u2013150, modest increase & variability t\u2248150\u2013206) (manifestation: small modulation of spectral magnitude in STFT) + Low overall trend and strong short-lag dependence (autocorrelation peak at lag \u22485\u20136 samples consistent across the series) (manifestation: repeating waveform shape with quick rise/fall per cycle).",
        "Overall interpretation and classification basis: The time series exhibits a stable, repetitive, narrowband oscillatory pattern with sharp per-cycle transitions and modest amplitude modulation. Combined with the dataset background (label 2 = sawing: controlled, repetitive wrist strokes), these features form a coherent evidence chain: repeated, narrowly concentrated spectral energy at \u22480.18 normalized frequency + consistent cycle shape and timing => strong positive SHAP attribution => model classifies this sample as SAWING.",
        "Overall feature pattern: A long-duration, stationary-like rhythmic oscillation dominates the entire sample (present from early to late time steps) with the strongest, cleanest manifestation in the central segment (t \u2248 55\u2013149).",
        "Dominant periodicity and spectrum: Energy concentrated in a narrow frequency band at normalized frequency \u2248 0.15\u20130.18 in the STFT (stable across time). Given the 16 Hz sampling rate, this corresponds approximately to a physical oscillation in the ~2\u20133 Hz range \u2014 consistent with repetitive wrist sawing motions.",
        "Amplitude and volatility: Amplitudes remain relatively high and consistent throughout (positive peaks roughly +0.6 to +1.0; negative troughs roughly -1.8 to -2.3). Volatility (cycle-to-cycle amplitude and period variability) is low in the central region and modestly higher at the start and end; occasional transient reductions in trough depth or minor baseline shifts occur but do not disrupt the dominant rhythmic pattern.",
        "Cycle morphology and time dependence: Cycles are asymmetric with a sharp negative-going stroke and a slower positive recovery; this substructure repeats reliably and produces strong autocorrelation at the oscillation period. The consistent morphology across many consecutive cycles gives a strong time-series dependence that the model leverages.",
        "Model classification basis (why label = SAWING): The classifier assigns positive importance to the persistent narrow-band oscillation (0.15\u20130.18), the stable amplitude envelope in the mid segment, and the asymmetric cycle shape (fast negative stroke / slower recovery). These combined time-domain and frequency-domain signatures match the expected repetitive sawing gesture described in the dataset background, differentiating it from other activities like walking (slower, different amplitude/time signature), running (higher-energy/broader-band), or mimicked seizures (nonstationary bursts).",
        "Summary pattern description (concise): Central, high-confidence evidence = steady ~2\u20133 Hz rhythmic oscillation with asymmetric cycles and stable amplitude (t \u2248 55\u2013149) + supportive but slightly noisier oscillations at the beginning and end; low-frequency baseline fluctuations occasionally reduce confidence but do not overturn the dominant sawing signature.",
        "The feature pattern of Sample 132 is: (1) Global periodic oscillation across the whole series (0\u2013207) with consistent cycle shape (rapid rise to narrow peak and quick fall to a small negative undershoot) and typical peak amplitudes around 2.1\u20132.5 and troughs near 0 to \u22120.5. (2) Dominant spectral energy at a mid-frequency band (~0.20 in STFT) present throughout but noticeably stronger in the interval t \u2248 111\u2013149 (manifestation: brighter STFT band and larger per-cycle amplitudes). (3) A localized amplitude/envelope increase and one sharper transient peak at t \u2248 128\u2013132 (manifestation: peak \u2248 2.7\u20132.9) that coincides with strong positive SHAP values (model attribution). (4) Low long-term trend and low stochastic volatility between cycles; variability is explained mainly by regular cycle-to-cycle oscillation and occasional amplitude modulation. Combined, these characteristics (stable, repetitive mid-frequency oscillation + localized amplitude boost) form the discriminative signature the model uses to classify this sample as SAWING (label 2).",
        "Overall pattern: The sample is dominated by a sustained, narrow-band periodic oscillation spanning the whole series with modest amplitude modulation. Primary feature: Mid-frequency rhythmic oscillation (dominant STFT energy around normalized freq ~0.18\u20130.24, corresponding to ~3.2 Hz at 16 Hz sampling) present throughout, with individual cycle period \u2248 5 samples (~0.31 s). Manifestation: Repetitive, high-energy cycles with peak-to-trough amplitudes typically 2.0\u20133.5 units (peaks 2.2\u20132.6, troughs ~-0.8 to -1.0) and asymmetric shape (strong, relatively broad positive peaks and sharper negative troughs). Secondary feature: Low-frequency (near-DC) energy and small baseline offset\u2014co-occurring particularly strongly in the mid-late segment (time steps 130\u2013170), amplifying positive attribution. Temporal dependence and variation: The oscillation is generally stationary in frequency but shows amplitude modulation \u2014 slightly increased amplitude and SHAP attribution in the 130\u2013170 window (highest confidence evidence for SAWING), intermittent weaker/irregular cycles at earlier windows (which reduce attribution), and sustained repetition toward the end (which reinforces attribution). Classification basis: The combination of a persistent narrow-band spectral ridge, regular cycle period, high and consistent amplitude envelope, and characteristic asymmetric cycle shape matches the repetitive back-and-forth wrist motion in the SAWING class and distinguishes it from running/walking (different amplitude/frequency envelope) and seizure-mimicking (more broadband, irregular transients)."

        "Observation (time steps 150\u2013188, \u22489.4\u201311.8 s) -> The SHAP heatmap shows a concentrated strong positive (red) band at the lowest frequency bins in this interval. In the time series plot this corresponds to a sequence of moderate-amplitude oscillations around a negative offset (values roughly between -2.5 and -1.0) with a narrow, short-lived upward spike near step ~186 (brief rise to ~0.0 to +0.1) immediately followed by a rapid deep trough around steps 192\u2013196 (down to \u2248 -3.0 to -3.3). The local volatility is high here (large magnitude change in \u224810\u201315 steps), slope of the spike-to-trough segment is steep (approx -0.2 to -0.3 normalized units per step). STFT shows enhanced energy concentrated at very low frequencies during this same interval. Implication -> The model attributes this low-frequency, step-like transient (a pronounced spike then quick trough embedded in low-frequency energy) positively toward the walking label; this substructure is consistent with a wrist-impact or pronounced arm swing that walking produces (low-frequency, high-energy transient).",
        "Observation (time steps 100\u2013125, \u22486.25\u20137.8 s) -> SHAP indicates positive contribution concentrated in the lowest-frequency band across this window. The raw trace contains a distinct asymmetric substructure: a rise from a local trough to a clear positive peak (peak near steps 110\u2013120, amplitude up to \u2248 +0.7 to +1.0), followed by a relatively rapid drop to a trough near step ~130 (\u2248 -2.5 to -2.8). The shape is a single strong peak followed by a larger negative excursion (fast change rate on the descending side). STFT shows increased low-frequency magnitude coincident with this time region. Implication -> The classifier is using this peak-then-trough, low-frequency gait-like oscillation as evidence for walking: this looks like a single gait cycle or a pronounced arm swing associated with a step.",
        "Observation (time steps 55\u201380, \u22483.4\u20135.0 s) -> SHAP contains smaller positive patches at low frequencies here. The time series shows recovery from an earlier trough to near-zero crossings and then several modest oscillations (amplitude range roughly -2.0 to +0.2) with relatively stable, medium volatility (no extremely sharp spikes). The STFT shows a moderate low-frequency band present in this region. Implication -> These smoother, lower-amplitude oscillations (low-frequency rhythmic motion) contribute positively to the walking decision\u2014interpreted by the model as lower-intensity steps or swings (e.g., slower pace or smaller gestures).",
        "Observation (time steps ~18\u201328, \u22481.1\u20131.75 s) -> SHAP shows a localized blue (negative) contribution at the lowest frequency at around step ~18, while neighboring bands show mixed colors. The time series exhibits a sudden deep trough reaching approximately -4.0 at ~step 25 preceded by small positive oscillations. STFT shows a burst of low-frequency energy as well as some broader spectral content. Implication -> That isolated, very large negative trough is driving the model away from other classes (blue SHAP) or reducing confidence in the target label; extreme isolated deflections (very large amplitude aberrations) appear to be treated differently from the regular low-frequency oscillations that define walking.",
        "Observation (frequency-domain summary) -> Across most positively-weighted (red) SHAP areas the energy emphasized by STFT is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins (closest to DC). There are only weak and intermittent contributions at mid frequencies (~0.08\u20130.15 on the STFT plot). Implication -> The classifier is relying mainly on slow, large-scale oscillatory components (low-frequency power) rather than sustained high-frequency content to recognize this sample as walking. Low-frequency bursts aligned with the temporal substructures above serve as main evidence.",
        "Observation (local shape/substructure types) -> The positively contributing time windows share common shapes: (a) asymmetric peak followed by deeper trough (steps 100\u2013130), (b) short upward spike immediately preceding a deep trough (150\u2013196), and (c) repeated moderate oscillations around a negative baseline (55\u201380, 150\u2013170). Implication -> The model expects gait-like, step-associated patterns that are not purely sinusoidal but show asymmetric transient signatures and repeated low-frequency swings; these substructures distinguish walking from other activities in this dataset.",
        "Observation: Strong positive SHAP contribution concentrated in the lowest frequency band (bottom row of the heatmap) between approximately time steps 55 and 130 (peak redness around 74\u2013130). -> Implication: The classifier strongly used low-frequency, large-scale oscillatory energy in that interval to increase the probability of the WALKING label. In the raw trace (time steps 55\u2013130) this corresponds to repeated, fairly regular swings with troughs near -7.0 and peaks near -3.2 to -3.6 (peak-to-trough range \u2248 3.5\u20134.0 normalized units). These oscillations are moderately high amplitude and dominant, consistent with rhythmic arm-swing motion in walking.",
        "Observation: Within the strong SHAP region (55\u2013130), the waveform shows repeated substructure: each cycle has a relatively sharp downward excursion to the trough (steep fall over ~1\u20134 time steps) and a more rounded return to the peak (rise over ~3\u20136 time steps). -> Implication: The asymmetric cycle shape (sharp downward impact then slower recovery) is likely characteristic of wrist acceleration during steps (impact/acceleration followed by slower deceleration) and therefore informative for the walking class.",
        "Observation: The time-frequency STFT shows most energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin across the same time window (55\u2013130) and smaller energy at a modest higher band (~0.08\u20130.12 row) intermittently. -> Implication: The raw oscillations are dominated by a low fundamental frequency (longer period cycles) with occasional harmonic or mid-frequency content; the dominance of the low-frequency fundamental is what drives the positive SHAP contribution for walking.",
        "Observation: A localized SHAP negative (blue) contribution appears around the mid-frequency row (~0.1) centered roughly at time steps 111\u2013130. -> Implication: In that short subinterval, an increase in mid-frequency energy reduces the model's confidence for the walking class \u2014 i.e., the presence of somewhat faster/irregular components or transient high-frequency content slightly counteracts the walking evidence (possibly representing a perturbation or non-walking micro-movement within the window). This is visible in the raw trace as slightly more jagged, quicker oscillations and a deeper trough around ~111\u2013120.",
        "Observation: Additional isolated positive SHAP spots occur near time steps ~167 and ~186 in the low-frequency band (weaker than the main 55\u2013130 region). Corresponding raw trace intervals show clear, but slightly lower amplitude oscillations (peaks around -3.6 to -4.0, troughs around -6.5 to -6.9). -> Implication: These later intervals provide reinforcing low-frequency walking evidence (short bouts of regular motion) that also support the walking label though less strongly than the main block.",
        "Observation: Amplitude and volatility summary across the red SHAP windows: typical instantaneous amplitude (distance from mean) is ~1.5\u20132.0 units; peak-to-peak is ~3.5\u20134.0 units; volatility is moderate with repetitive, sustained cycles rather than isolated spikes. -> Implication: The sustained moderate-amplitude periodic motion is indicative of a continuous periodic activity (consistent with walking) rather than brief transient actions (e.g., sawing or a seizure mimic which would show different frequency/irregular signatures).",
        "Observation: Rate-of-change characteristics in red regions: falling edges (toward trough) are steeper than rising edges \u2014 often a drop of ~1.5\u20133.0 units in 1\u20134 time steps, followed by a slower recovery over ~3\u20136 time steps. -> Implication: This asymmetry (fast downward acceleration followed by slower return) is consistent with accelerometer signatures of repeated footfall/arm-swing impacts during walking and therefore a discriminative micro-pattern for the walking class.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 37\u2013130): A long contiguous red region in the SHAP heatmap aligns with repeated sharp upward peaks in the time series between sample indices ~37 and ~130. Peaks reach approximately -2.0 to -2.6 (normalized) while intervening troughs lie around -5.0 to -6.3. The sequence shows a fairly regular spike\u2013drop waveform: rapid rise (2\u20134 samples) to local maximum, followed by slower decline (4\u201310 samples) into a trough. STFT: strong energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin across this window and moderate energy in a mid-low band (~0.10\u20130.13 on the plot). -> Implication: These slow, regular oscillations with large, sharp positive-going transients are strongly positively contributing to the model\u2019s decision for the sample label. The spectral content (dominant low-frequency + a consistent mid-low periodic component) and temporal shape (consistent arm-swing-like peaks) are characteristic of cyclic wrist motion, consistent with walking cadence rather than erratic or very high-frequency activities.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 74\u2013111 substructure): Inside the larger red zone there is particularly intense SHAP redness around t \u2248 74\u2013111 where peaks are frequent and some troughs reach the lowest values in the whole series (~ -6.3). The local peak-to-trough amplitude is maximized here and the inter-peak intervals are slightly shorter (more frequent cycles). STFT in this sub-window shows relatively higher mid-low frequency energy compared to neighboring times. -> Implication: The model places especially high positive attribution on this denser, higher-amplitude rhythmic substructure; this likely signals a stronger, clearer walking cadence (a period of particularly consistent arm swings) that increases confidence for the WALKING label.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u201337): Early segment (samples 0\u201337) shows similar oscillatory shape but with slightly lower peak heights (peaks around -2.4 to -3.0) and more variable trough depths (-5.2 to -5.8). SHAP shows weak positive and a small blue area around t \u2248 18\u201337 at the lowest frequency bin. STFT: lowest-frequency energy still present but less dominant. -> Implication: The model finds these earlier, lower-amplitude cycles less strongly indicative of walking (small or mixed attribution); lower signal clarity here reduces positive evidence compared with the strong mid-portion.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 149\u2013186 and t \u2248 167\u2013186 red cluster): A later red cluster (approx samples 149\u2013186, strongest 167\u2013186) corresponds to a segment where peak amplitudes increase in frequency and peaks become sharper (peak magnitudes near -2.0 to -1.8) while troughs are slightly shallower (-4.5 to -5.5). STFT shows continued low-frequency dominance and a modest rise in low-to-mid frequency energy during this period. -> Implication: Renewed, clearer rhythmic swings late in the record again contribute positively to the walking classification \u2014 likely another sustained period of arm swings (possibly the subject changed pace or became more regular), reinforcing the model\u2019s prediction.",
        "Observation (global trend): Across the full series there is a slight upward shift in baseline (values become slightly less negative toward the end) and peak frequency appears to increase marginally in later windows (peaks are closer together after ~150). Volatility (peak-to-trough difference) remains moderate to high throughout, but is highest in the mid-window (t \u2248 74\u2013111). -> Implication: The combination of a mild upward baseline shift plus increasing cadence supports interpretation as changes in walking speed/pattern (for example slightly faster or more pronounced arm swings later), which the model uses as corroborating evidence for the WALKING label.",
        "Observation (rate-of-change & substructure): The prominent positive transients are characterized by steep positive slopes over ~2\u20134 samples and steeper magnitude than the return slopes in many cycles; occasional isolated deep troughs (notably around t \u2248 80\u201395) break the uniformity. STFT shows those trough regions still dominated by low-frequency energy but with transient mid-frequency content. -> Implication: The asymmetric spike shape (fast rise, slower descent) and occasional deep troughs are consistent with natural arm-swing acceleration followed by deceleration/recovery, a biomechanical signature the model associates with walking rather than continuous high-frequency repetitive tasks (e.g., sawing) or highly irregular seizure-like motions.",
        "Observation (frequency attribution): SHAP heatmap red is concentrated at the very lowest frequency bin and some mid-low bins; STFT confirms that most signal energy across high-attribution windows is at the lowest frequency plus a smaller, consistent band near ~0.10\u20130.13. -> Implication: The classifier relies primarily on low-frequency rhythmic content (walking cadence) and a stable mid-low harmonic to identify this sample as walking. High-frequency content is minimal and not driving the positive attribution.",
        "Observation (time 37\u201356): The trace contains repeated sharp negative excursions reaching approx -8.0 to -8.7 (troughs) followed by fast rebounds up to about -5.0 to -6.0. Individual drops and recoveries occur within 1\u20133 time steps producing local slopes on the order of ~1.0\u20132.0 normalized units / sample. Volatility is high (large peak-to-trough amplitude within a few samples) and the local shape is asymmetric (steep fall then quicker or stepwise recovery). -> Implication: These rapid, high-amplitude swings produce broadband energy but are captured in the STFT as increased low-frequency magnitude plus transient higher-frequency components; SHAP marks the corresponding low-frequency band as positively contributing, so the model likely treats these repetitive swing-like troughs as evidence of locomotor arm swings characteristic of walking rather than isolated artifacts.",
        "Observation (time 74\u2013111): The signal shows a sustained sequence of moderate-amplitude oscillations centered around a higher baseline (values cluster ~ -5.0 to -6.0) with frequent upward peaks approaching -4.0. The oscillations are regular, with cycles repeating roughly every 8\u201312 samples (period \u2248 8\u201312 samples, i.e. \u22480.5\u20130.75 s at 16 Hz). Volatility is moderate (smaller trough depth than window 37\u201356) and the pattern is more rhythmic. STFT shows strong energy concentrated at very low frequencies (near 0 Hz) and clear energy in the 0.1\u20130.2 normalized band. -> Implication: The regular, rhythmic, low-frequency oscillation and small baseline elevation are classic walking signatures (periodic arm swing/step cadence). SHAP assigns a strong positive contribution in the low-frequency band here, indicating the model uses this stable rhythmic component to favor the WALKING class.",
        "Observation (time 130\u2013149): Several pronounced upward spikes (to ~ -4.0) interleaved with troughs (to ~ -7.5) occur, with somewhat larger inter-peak variability than the central region. The rate of change is again fast on short windows (1\u20134 samples), producing both sustained low-frequency energy and intermittent higher-frequency content. STFT indicates increased magnitude at the lowest frequency bins plus a visible patch around ~0.28 normalized frequency at this segment. -> Implication: This segment likely corresponds to a transient change in gait (a faster step or an accompanying gesture). The positive SHAP at low frequencies together with mid-low-frequency contribution suggests the classifier interprets these cadence changes as still consistent with walking.",
        "Observation (time 0\u201318, especially around time step \u224818): The start of the series contains a brief interval where the signal dips to a deep trough (~ -7.5 to -8.0) and the SHAP map shows localized blue (negative) contribution at low frequency and at ~0.13 normalized frequency. Overall this short segment is less rhythmic and more isolated compared with the central windows. -> Implication: The model down-weights or penalizes this isolated deep trough because it resembles non-walking artefacts (e.g., a sudden knock, a seizure-like isolated spike, or sawing transient) and thus these short isolated events reduce the walking-likelihood locally.",
        "Observation (global low-frequency emphasis across time ~18\u2013186): The STFT and SHAP heatmap both show persistent, strong magnitude concentrated at the lowest frequency bin (near 0 Hz) for most of the middle portion of the sequence (approx time steps 18 through 186). Multiple time windows within that span show strong red SHAP values at frequency \u22480.0 and additional positive patches at 0.1\u20130.2 normalized frequency. -> Implication: The classifier relies heavily on sustained baseline modulation (DC/very-low-frequency content) plus a periodic component in the 0.1\u20130.2 band to predict WALKING. In practice this means the model uses both slow shifts in mean acceleration (arm orientation/pendular motion) and the step cadence harmonic to distinguish walking from other activities.",
        "Observation (local frequency-substructure): The STFT exhibits lower-amplitude energy at intermediate normalized frequencies (~0.1\u20130.3) in pulses that line up with windows where the time series shows more regular oscillations or faster peaks. SHAP highlights some of these intermediate bands as mildly positive (red) at the times where oscillations are most regular. -> Implication: These intermediate-frequency components represent the step cadence/harmonics (approximately 1.6\u20134.8 Hz when mapped from sampling rate) and provide additional evidence to the classifier that the motion is periodic walking rather than non-periodic sawing or brief seizure mimicry.",
        "Observation (change-rate and substructure across windows): Across the sequence the pattern alternates between (A) short bursts of high-amplitude, high-rate changes (sharp troughs and rebounds) and (B) longer stretches of moderate, regular oscillations with a raised baseline. Both occur repeatedly but the regular stretches dominate the signal in duration. -> Implication: The dominance of consistent rhythmic windows (B) combined with occasional sharper swings (A) forms a composite signature the model interprets as walking with variable pace/gestures; SHAP focuses positively on the rhythmic baseline portions while penalizing isolated non-rhythmic dips.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 40\u201358): A prominent biphasic event begins with a rapid rise from about 0 to a peak \u2248 +2.2\u2013+2.8 (time steps ~40\u201348) followed within ~8\u201312 steps by a steep fall to a trough around \u22121.0 to \u22121.4 (time steps ~54\u201358). The slope of the rising edge is large (high positive change rate) and the falling edge is equally steep (high negative change rate); the local volatility is high (large amplitude swing over a short interval). -> Implication: This is a strong low-frequency arm/limb swing cycle (large excursion followed by opposite-phase return). The SHAP heatmap shows strong positive attribution at low frequencies for this time window, indicating this distinct slow, high-amplitude oscillation strongly increases the model's confidence in the walking label.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 166\u2013190): A sustained positive-valued segment where the signal rises from slightly negative/near-zero to a plateau in the range \u2248 +1.2 to +2.0 and then oscillates with small amplitude (rough, 0.1\u20130.6) around that elevated baseline across ~20\u201325 steps. Volatility is moderate-to-low compared with the mid-series peak; the shape is a broad, low-frequency envelope with superimposed small oscillations. -> Implication: This represents a steady, continuous walking phase (consistent arm swing cadence at a stable pace). The SHAP map shows red (positive contribution) concentrated at the lowest frequencies here, so sustained low-frequency energy in this window supports classification as walking.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u201315): The start of the series contains moderate but clear oscillations with two upward peaks reaching \u2248 +1.0\u2013+2.3 and intervening drops to near 0; the changes are less abrupt than the mid-series peak but still show periodic up/down structure. -> Implication: Early-period regular swings (moderate amplitude, moderate slope) are also positive contributors to the walking label\u2014these are consistent with initial gait cycles or short, distinct strides.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 88\u2013100): A localized negative excursion occurs (signal falls to \u2248 \u22121.0 to \u22121.6 around t\u224892\u201398) preceded and followed by rises back toward positive values. The event is relatively short (\u22488\u201312 steps) and shows a sharper negative trough than surrounding fluctuations. The SHAP heatmap in that area shows blue/near-zero values at low frequencies. -> Implication: This transient irregularity slightly reduces the model's walking score (negative SHAP), possibly corresponding to a stride irregularity, a change in gesture, or a brief non-walking motion; however, it is isolated and followed by return to the walking-like pattern so it does not overturn the overall classification.",
        "Observation (frequency-domain summary across times highlighted by SHAP): The STFT image shows most signal energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins, with intermittent weaker energy in slightly higher bands (mid-low frequencies). The SHAP heatmap highlights the lowest-frequency band (near the bottom row) as having the strongest positive SHAP values in multiple time windows (notably around t\u224840\u201358 and t\u2248166\u2013190). -> Implication: The predictive features are dominated by slow oscillations (low-frequency content) rather than high-frequency components. Such low-frequency, periodic energy is characteristic of rhythmic limb motion (walking) and is the primary basis for positive attribution in the model.",
        "Observation (temporal structure / substructure): The series shows repeating up\u2013down cycles (alternating peaks and troughs) with inter-peak spacings roughly in the 25\u201345 time-step range. The amplitude of cycles and local volatility vary over the record: mid-series cycles are larger and sharper, later cycles are smaller and smoother. -> Implication: There is quasi-periodicity (gait-like cadence) with occasional changes in step amplitude/pattern (different paces or gestures). The model leverages both the periodicity and the amplitude envelope changes; large, well-formed low-frequency cycles give stronger positive contribution to the walking class.",
        "Observation (change-rate asymmetry and shape): Many positive cycles show a faster rising edge and a slower decaying return (asymmetric peak shapes), while some troughs are sharper than surrounding rises. -> Implication: The asymmetric shape (fast push, slower return) is consistent with wrist acceleration from natural arm swing during walking (distinct phasic pattern). The SHAP map emphasizes those low-frequency, asymmetric shapes as beneficial to the walking prediction."

      "pattern": [
        "The feature pattern of Sample 70 is: Dominant low-frequency oscillatory activity (present across the record but concentrated in several windows) + Intermittent asymmetric transient events (occurrence times ~100\u2013130 and ~150\u2013196) characterized by sharp peak-to-trough sequences and brief spikes + A global negative baseline offset (the series spends much of its duration below zero, mean approximately around -1 to -1.5) + Irregular periodicity (recurrent oscillation-like events separated by variable intervals of ~30\u201380 steps rather than a strictly constant period) + Local high-volatility segments (short windows with steep slopes and rapid changes) + Lack of sustained high-frequency energy (STFT shows energy concentrated near the lowest frequency bins with only weak mid-frequency content).",
        "Interpretation in context: The classifier appears to rely on repeated, low-frequency, step-like arm-swing signatures (asymmetric peaks and spike-then-trough events) that are temporally localized; these events, when present in the lowest-frequency STFT bins, receive strong positive SHAP attribution and drive the sample toward the WALKING label. Conversely, extremely isolated large deflections (very deep single troughs) produce negative attribution, suggesting the model distinguishes regular gait cycles from isolated aberrant motions.",
        "Overall pattern: The sample is dominated by sustained, regular, low-frequency oscillations across the full record (0\u2013206 time steps) with varying amplitude modulation. Primary repeated cycles appear roughly every 8\u201314 time steps (period \u2248 8\u201314 steps \u2192 0.5\u20130.9 s per cycle; approximate fundamental frequency ~1.1\u20132.0 Hz given Fs = 16 Hz).",
        "Trend and baseline: The signal has a negative offset (values clustered between roughly -7.5 and -3.0) and no long-term monotonic drift; instead the dominant structure is stationary periodic oscillation with mild amplitude modulation over time.",
        "Periodicity and regularity: The trace shows sustained rhythmicity \u2014 regular peaks and troughs across the sequence \u2014 but with local modulation in amplitude and occasional brief irregularities (e.g., around 111\u2013130 where mid-frequency power increases and SHAP turns slightly negative). These local perturbations do not eliminate the underlying periodic pattern but slightly alter spectral content.",
        "Volatility and substructure: Volatility is moderate and concentrated in the repetitive cycles: relatively large peak-to-trough swings (\u22483.5\u20134.0 units) repeated many times. Substructure inside each cycle is asymmetric (sharp downward movement, slower upward recovery), producing a characteristic waveform shape that repeats. Occasional isolated lower-amplitude oscillatory bursts (e.g., around 167 and 186) act as secondary supporting evidence.",
        "Temporal dependence and combination: The classifier appears to combine long-run evidence of persistent low-frequency energy (positive SHAP in 55\u2013130 and other low-frequency red spots) with local checks on mid-frequency content (negative SHAP where mid-frequency energy rises). In other words, sustained low-frequency rhythmic energy is the dominant cue for walking, while transient increases of mid/high frequencies slightly reduce walking likelihood and likely indicate non-walking micro-movements or noise.",
        "Overall pattern for Sample 62 (Label 3, WALKING): Repetitive low-frequency oscillatory pattern present across the whole series with three distinguished epochs: 1) Early epoch (t \u2248 0\u201337): lower-amplitude, moderately regular cycles (weaker positive attribution). 2) Central epoch (t \u2248 37\u2013130, strongest at 74\u2013111): high-amplitude, regular spike\u2013trough cycles with maximal peak-to-trough variation and highest positive SHAP attribution; dominant energy at the lowest frequency and consistent mid-low frequency band \u2014 this is the clearest walking cadence signature. 3) Late epoch (t \u2248 149\u2013206, especially 167\u2013186): renewed clearer rhythmic peaks, slightly higher cadence and shallower troughs, again positively attributed. Temporal dependence: cyclic peaks recur at roughly regular intervals (~8\u201312 samples) with local changes in amplitude and cadence that the model uses cumulatively. Volatility: moderate-to-high (peak-to-trough range ~3\u20134.5 normalized units), largest in the mid-window. Frequency content: dominated by the lowest frequency band with consistent mid-low harmonic, matching periodic wrist swings of walking rather than high-frequency continuous motion or highly irregular seizure-like patterns. These combined temporal and spectral features form the basis for classifying the sample as WALKING.",
        "Overall feature pattern for Sample 60: (0\u201318) Brief non-rhythmic deep troughs (isolated, high amplitude) that slightly decrease walking evidence (negative SHAP) + (18\u2013186) Dominant rhythmic locomotion signature characterized by sustained low-frequency magnitude (near-DC baseline shifts) combined with periodic energy in the 0.1\u20130.2 normalized band (cycle period \u2248 8\u201312 samples, i.e. \u22480.5\u20130.75 s) and intermittent higher-amplitude swings (manifestation: repeated peaks to ~-4 and troughs to ~-8) that increase model confidence for WALKING (positive SHAP) + (186\u2013205) End segment with declining energy and fewer regular cycles (reduced, but still present, positive low-frequency contribution).",
        "Temporal dependence and combination: The classifier appears to weight sustained low-frequency baseline modulation (captures arm orientation and long-wave motion) together with a periodic cadence in the 0.1\u20130.2 band (step frequency/harmonics). Regular rhythmic stretches contribute strongly and positively to the walking label; isolated abrupt troughs or very short non-periodic bursts are down-weighted (negative SHAP) because they can resemble other activities (seizure mimic or sawing). The sample therefore shows a time-dependent mix: repeated rhythmic windows provide the primary evidence for WALKING while transient sharp events create local negative contributions but do not overturn the overall classification.",
        "Overall feature pattern of Sample 47: (1) Dominant low-frequency periodic oscillations across the whole series (global) \u2014 alternating positive and negative swings approximately every 25\u201345 time steps, visible as repeated peaks and troughs in the time trace and as concentrated energy in the lowest STFT bins. This low-frequency periodicity is the principal pattern driving classification as walking.",
        "(2) Large transient biphasic event (t \u2248 40\u201358) \u2014 a high-amplitude positive peak immediately followed by a deep negative trough (high volatility, steep slopes). This event produces the strongest positive SHAP attribution and is a decisive walking indicator in this sample.",
        "(3) Steady mid-to-late plateau with small oscillations (t \u2248 166\u2013190) \u2014 a prolonged positive-offset oscillatory window with reduced volatility relative to the biphasic mid-series peak. The low-frequency energy here also contributes positively to the walking label, representing a continuous, stable gait phase.",
        "(4) Isolated irregular trough (t \u2248 88\u2013100) \u2014 short-duration, sharper negative deviation with negative/neutral SHAP contribution, interpreted as a brief deviation from the dominant walking rhythm (e.g., gesture change or stride irregularity) but insufficient to negate the walking pattern.",
        "(5) Variation in amplitude and volatility over time \u2014 early cycles are moderate, middle cycles show highest amplitude and volatility, later cycles are milder and steadier. The model appears to use both the presence of sustained low-frequency periodicity and the occurrence of clear, larger-amplitude cycles as positive evidence for walking, while isolated erratic, higher-frequency or strongly negative-attributed segments reduce confidence locally but do not dominate the global decision."

        "Observation (t \u2248 15\u201322): The SHAP heatmap shows a strong red patch concentrated at the lowest frequency band (labelled 0.0) around time steps ~15\u201322. In the time series plot that interval contains a sequence of high peaks (~3.0\u20134.1) and deep troughs (~0.0\u20130.5) with a locally elevated mean. Implication: A local DC/low-frequency offset and high-amplitude transient oscillation in this window are interpreted by the model as evidence for the epilepsy class (positive SHAP). The STFT supports this: increased energy at the lowest frequency bin at the same times, indicating a sustained baseline elevation or slow component combined with a burst of energy.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 70\u201395): The SHAP map shows mixed weak red/white at multiple low-to-mid frequency bands in the mid-segment. The raw trace here is still oscillatory but with slightly reduced peak amplitude (roughly 1.5\u20133.2) and somewhat more regular cycles. Implication: The model registers some positive contribution from low-frequency content here, but it is weaker; the more regular periodic shape (less irregular bursting) reduces the epilepsy score relative to the stronger bursts. STFT shows moderate energy around a mid-frequency band (~0.2 normalized) during parts of this window indicating periodic oscillations.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 110\u2013170): The SHAP heatmap shows a broad red region again concentrated at the lowest frequency (0.0) and extending into some mid frequencies (~0.15\u20130.25) between roughly t=130 and t=170. The time series in this interval exhibits several large-amplitude, irregular spikes reaching above 3.5 and several abrupt dips to \u22480.1, plus a slow upward shift in baseline toward the end of this window. Implication: The combination of (1) renewed low-frequency/DC energy (sustained baseline shift) and (2) irregular high-amplitude transients increases the epilepsy attribution in the model. STFT corroborates increased low-frequency and some mid-frequency energy here, which the model uses as positive evidence.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 0\u201310 and t \u2248 186\u2013205): The SHAP heatmap shows very strong red at the lowest frequency (0.0) at the very beginning (near t=0\u201310) and again around the very end (t\u2248186\u2013205). In the signal these intervals include strong initial peaks and a higher mean level toward the end (values stay around 2.0\u20132.9). Implication: Persistent elevated mean (DC offset) at the start and end produces positive SHAP mass, so the model treats sustained baseline elevation at multiple points as supporting epilepsy.",
        "Observation (scattered mid-frequency blue patches, e.g., around t\u224830\u201360 and t\u2248150): The SHAP heatmap shows localized blue (negative) contributions at mid-frequency bands (~0.1\u20130.25) at several time windows. The raw series in those windows appears more regular, with evenly spaced oscillations (consistent amplitude and period). Implication: Regular, periodic mid-frequency oscillations act against the epilepsy prediction (negative SHAP) \u2014 the model likely associates such stable rhythmic patterns with non-epilepsy activities (e.g., walking). The STFT shows clear mid-frequency band energy during these times, consistent with rhythmic movement.",
        "Observation (local change-rate and volatility): In windows flagged red (e.g., 15\u201322 and 130\u2013170) the instantaneous change rate is high: single-step differences frequently exceed 1.0 units and the sign alternates rapidly with irregular amplitudes. Volatility (local standard deviation) is visibly larger than in more regular windows. Implication: The model treats sudden large-amplitude, irregular fluctuations and increased volatility as seizure-like features (positive attribution). Conversely, low volatility regular oscillation reduces epilepsy attribution.",
        "Observation (shape/substructure): The red-contributing segments show asymmetric spike shapes \u2014 fast rise to a peak and slower decay or abrupt drop to near-zero \u2014 rather than symmetric sinusoidal cycles. Implication: Asymmetric, burst-like substructures are used by the model as markers for epilepsy, distinct from symmetric, sinusoid-like gait oscillations which are negatively weighted.",
        "Observation (global balance): Although there are several red (positive) low-frequency patches, there are many mid-frequency negative (blue) patches across the time series. The model's logits show close scores for epilepsy (logit ~1.53) and walking (logit ~1.79), indicating conflicting evidence. Implication: The model receives competing cues \u2014 bursty low-frequency/offset features push toward epilepsy, while widespread rhythmic mid-frequency content suppresses it and favors walking, producing a near-tie and eventual walking prediction."

        "Feature pattern summary for this sample: (1) Low-frequency / DC elevation and bursty transients (occurrence: t\u22480\u201322, 110\u2013170, 186\u2013205) manifested as sustained baseline elevation plus irregular high-amplitude spikes (appearance: asymmetric peaks up to ~4.0 and deep troughs near 0; heatmap color: red at freq 0.0 and some mid bands; interpretation: these features increase epilepsy score according to SHAP) + (2) Regular mid-frequency oscillatory activity (occurrence: scattered windows, notably t\u224830\u201360 and parts of t\u224870\u2013130) manifested as periodic, relatively symmetric cycles with moderate amplitude (~1.5\u20133.2; heatmap color: blue at ~0.1\u20130.25; interpretation: these features decrease epilepsy score and are treated as evidence for walking) + (3) High local volatility and rapid change rate in red windows (occurrence: t\u224815\u201322 and t\u2248130\u2013170) manifested as large single-step jumps and irregular spacing of peaks (heatmap color: red; interpretation: considered seizure-like). The model's final decision reflects a conflict: red low-frequency bursts push probability toward epilepsy, but the more pervasive rhythmic mid-frequency activity (blue SHAP) pushes toward walking; net effect (slightly higher logit for walking) produces predicted label = walking (3) despite substantial epilepsy-supporting evidence (logit close to epilepsy)."

        "Observation (late low-frequency, strong red): Between time steps \u2248130\u2013205 the SHAP heatmap shows strong red concentrated at the lowest frequency band (near 0 Hz). -> Implication: In the raw signal this corresponds to a sustained upward baseline and larger positive peaks in the last ~25\u201375 samples (roughly the final third of the series). Concretely, the waveform in that interval has peak amplitudes rising to ~2.0\u20132.3, troughs that are shallower (around -1.3 to -0.8) and a visibly elevated local mean (baseline around \u2248+0.7\u20131.1). The model treats that sustained DC/very-low-frequency increase as a strong positive cue for the predicted class (red in SHAP) \u2014 i.e., the classifier has learned to associate an elevated baseline / tonic increase late in the sequence with the target class (predicted class 2).",
        "Observation (mid-low frequency band, repeated red patches): Around time steps \u224870\u2013150 the SHAP heatmap shows red at a mid-low frequency band (~0.15\u20130.20 on the STFT axis). -> Implication: The signal in that middle window contains regular, moderately spaced large spikes (periodic pulse-like substructure). On the plot these appear as repeating sharp rises to ~1.5\u20132.0 followed by falls to ~-1.0, with a consistent inter-peak spacing (visible periodic peaks). The model is positively attributing these rhythmic pulse components (energy in that mid-low band) to the predicted class, i.e., it uses that periodic, pulse-like movement pattern as supporting evidence.",
        "Observation (localized high positive SHAP at earliest and latest boundary points): Small red squares occur at earliest (\u22480\u20135) and latest indices (\u2248186\u2013205) at very-low frequencies. -> Implication: The classifier gives additional positive weight to the presence of even a small DC offset or initial/terminal elevated magnitude. On the waveform the first few samples show a smaller positive offset (~+0.8) and the final samples remain elevated (~+0.8\u20131.0). The model treats these boundary offsets as positive indicators for the chosen label.",
        "Observation (negative/blue contributions in early-mid windows): The SHAP map shows blue (negative) contributions at several mid frequencies around time steps \u224818\u201355 (noted strongest at the lowest frequency at t\u224818 and at \u22480.08\u20130.12 band). -> Implication: The earlier part of the sequence contains sharper negative troughs and brief low-baseline intervals (the plot shows deeper troughs down to \u2248-1.2 around these times). Those characteristics reduce the model's score for the predicted class (they are evidence against class 2). In short, the model prefers the later elevated baseline and steadier periodic pulses and disfavors the earlier deeper negative excursions.",
        "Observation (change rate and substructure of spikes): Individual upward transitions to peaks are steep (rise over 1\u20133 time steps) followed by moderately steep falls; this pattern repeats regularly across the signal, but during the late interval the rises reach higher absolute maxima and the falls are less negative. -> Implication: The classifier appears to combine both instantaneous change-rate features (fast rises) and longer-term asymmetry (higher peaks + shallower troughs) when attributing positive evidence for the predicted class. The SHAP red at mid-low frequencies aligns with the periodic fast-rising spikes; the red at near-zero frequency aligns with the longer-term offset/asymmetry.",
        "Observation (STFT corroboration of spectral features): The STFT shows consistent energy concentrated at very-low frequencies and a mid-low frequency band across the series with a marked increase in very-low-frequency energy around the late time window (bright yellow/green at the bottom band near t\u2248167). -> Implication: The time-frequency view confirms that the red SHAP at low frequencies corresponds to increased spectral power at near-DC in the late portion of the sequence. The model is therefore responding to both time-domain baseline shifts and the same effect seen in the spectral domain (sustained low-frequency energy).",
        "Observation -> In the SHAP heatmap there is a strong positive (red) band concentrated at the lowest frequency row (near 0.0 on the vertical axis) spanning roughly the time-step columns between ~55 and ~130 (centered around the markers 74, 93, 111, 130). Implication -> The model is relying heavily on persistent low-frequency energy (a slowly varying baseline / DC-like component) in that mid-section to support the predicted class (walking). In the raw trace over time steps 55\u2013130 this corresponds to a long sequence of regular oscillations with pronounced negative bias (troughs around -2.2 to -2.8) and recurring positive peaks near +0.7 to +1.0. Specific local features: amplitude range in this window \u2248 [+0.7, -2.8]; the waveform is asymmetric (short, sharp positive spikes followed by longer, deeper negative troughs), cycle-to-cycle spacing is regular (roughly 6\u20138 time steps between successive positive peaks), and volatility is moderate (peak-to-peak magnitude stable across the window). This combination (strong low-frequency content + asymmetric steady oscillation) is being interpreted by the model as evidence for walking.",
        "Observation -> The SHAP heatmap shows additional positive (red) at a mid-low frequency band (around the 0.15\u20130.2 row) at several time columns (notably around time indices ~37, ~74). Implication -> There is a secondary, higher-frequency harmonic or periodic component present intermittently; in the STFT this band also shows measurable energy. In the time plot these correspond to small intra-cycle ripples and a slightly faster sub-oscillation superimposed on the main cycle (visible as modest changes in the slope of rises and falls). The model treats these mid-low frequency harmonics as supporting evidence for the predicted class (walking) as well.",
        "Observation -> The SHAP heatmap contains localized blue (negative) patches at mid-frequency rows and at low-frequency at a few columns (notable negative patch near the mid-frequency row at the column around ~111 and small blue at the lowest frequency at ~18). Implication -> Those time-frequency components actively reduce the predicted probability of walking (i.e., they push the model away from class 3). In the raw trace the same columns correspond to short moments where the waveform briefly deviates from its otherwise regular pattern (slightly sharper transients or tighter spacing between peaks). These transient, higher-frequency-like events are likely more indicative of running (higher cadence) and would support the true label, but they are weaker/less consistent so they receive negative SHAP relative to the walking-predicting features.",
        "Observation -> Across the whole series the raw waveform is strongly periodic with consistent cycle morphology and a persistent negative offset (the baseline of oscillation sits well below zero). Implication -> The time series shows strong long-range periodic dependence (repeating strokes/gestures of similar shape). Because the model focuses on the persistent low-frequency baseline and cycle regularity (red SHAP at low freq across many columns), it treats this as a walking-like signature (steady, regular arm motion) rather than the more variable, high-cadence signature expected for running.",
        "Observation -> Substructure: individual cycles show a fast rising edge (steep slope to the positive peak) followed by a slower fall into the deep negative trough (asymmetric triangular/spike-like shape). Implication -> This shape produces both low-frequency energy (due to the long negative trough) and harmonics (due to the sharp rising edges). The model\u2019s positive SHAP emphasis on the low-frequency rows indicates it weights the trough-dominated energy more heavily than the sharp rising-edge harmonics, biasing the decision toward walking.",
        "Observation -> Time-range differences: the earliest segment (time steps 0\u201337) is slightly less regular and has a few lower-amplitude cycles compared with the middle segment (55\u2013130), which is the most regular/high-amplitude region and also where SHAP red is strongest. Implication -> The model is effectively using the middle segment as the decisive evidence; because that mid-segment is very regular and dominated by low-frequency power, the classifier favors walking even though other segments contain hints (higher cadence, transients) consistent with running.",
        "Observation (t = 0\u2013~90): a long, low\u2011variance baseline around normalized value \u22481.15\u20131.25 with only tiny fluctuations (amplitude spread \u22480.05\u20130.1). -> Implication: the large DC/offset component in the early portion (strong red in SHAP at frequency \u22480.0 and times ~18\u201374) is treated by the model as a positive cue for the predicted class. A sustained flat offset often acts like a class anchor (the model has learned to associate this baseline level with the predicted label).",
        "Observation (t \u2248 88\u201398): a short, abrupt transient \u2014 the signal jumps from the baseline (~1.2) up to ~1.9 then immediately plunges to ~0.3 and back into higher amplitude oscillation. This is a high change\u2011rate event (large first derivative over 2\u20135 samples). -> Implication: this onset transient aligns with an energy burst in the STFT at the same time window and produces positive SHAP mass at low / mid frequencies. The model uses the abrupt onset as an indicator of a change of activity (positive evidence for the predicted class).",
        "Observation (t \u2248 95\u2013207): a clear, sustained oscillatory regime with repeating peaks and troughs. Peak amplitudes reach \u22483.5\u20134.0 (local maxima) and troughs \u2248-1.0 to -1.6 (local minima) giving a peak\u2011to\u2011peak envelope \u22484.5\u20135.5. Individual cycles repeat roughly every 8\u201312 samples (period \u22480.5\u20130.75 s at 16 Hz sampling; implied frequency \u22481.3\u20132.0 Hz). -> Implication: the persistent band of spectral energy visible in the STFT at normalized frequencies \u22480.10\u20130.18 (and the red SHAP at those bins around times ~111\u2013130) indicates the classifier relies on mid/low-frequency rhythmic motion as positive evidence. The relatively large amplitude and regularity reinforce the model\u2019s decision.",
        "Observation (shape/substructure of oscillation): positive peaks are sharper and larger than negative troughs (asymmetric waveform), and cycle amplitudes show modest envelope modulation (some cycles slightly larger, others smaller) rather than monotonic decay. -> Implication: the asymmetry and amplitude modulation create harmonic content seen in STFT as energy at the fundamental plus small sidebands; SHAP highlights the fundamental (positive contribution) while some harmonic bands are neutral or slightly negative. The model appears to favor the presence of a strong fundamental frequency component coupled with the DC offset.",
        "Observation (spectral detail): STFT shows concentrated energy at the lowest frequency bin (DC) throughout and a secondary band centered around normalized 0.10\u20130.18 during the oscillatory interval; mid\u2011bands (\u22480.12\u20130.3) show mixed/negative SHAP contributions in places. -> Implication: the classifier weights the DC + a specific low\u2011frequency rhythm positively but downweights some neighboring frequency content. This selective spectral weighting explains why some portions of the oscillation help the predicted class while others (different phases/frequencies) slightly oppose it.",
        "Observation (temporal distribution of positive SHAP): strongest red SHAP patches appear at (a) the DC/low\u2011freq bins during the early flat section (t ~18\u201393) and (b) at the low mid\u2011frequency band during the initial cycles after onset (t ~93\u2013130). -> Implication: the model\u2019s decision is driven both by the baseline offset and by the early oscillation cycles; later cycles (t > ~150) are less strongly positive or are a mixture of small positive and negative contributions, so later variation has diminishing extra influence on the prediction.",
        "Observation: A sustained band of positive SHAP values (red) appears across low-frequency rows (~0.07\u20130.12 normalized frequency) between time steps ~37 and ~130 (tick labels: 37, 55, 74, 93, 111, 130). Implication: On the raw trace during this interval the signal shows a repeating cycle of a sharp, brief upward peak (\u2248 +0.8 to +1.1 normalized units) followed by a larger downward excursion (\u2248 -1.8 to -3.0). The cycles are strongly asymmetric (fast rise in 1\u20132 samples, slower fall over ~4\u20138 samples). The STFT shows concentrated energy in the same low-frequency band during the same time window, indicating a dominant rhythmic motion. The model therefore uses this low-frequency, asymmetric periodic structure as positive evidence for the predicted class (SHAP red \u2192 increases probability of class 3).",
        "Observation: A localized strong negative SHAP (deep blue) appears at the lowest frequency row (near 0.0) at time step ~18. Implication: In the raw signal around t\u224818 there is a single large transient (a very high positive spike \u2248 +1.3 immediately followed by a very deep trough \u2248 -3.1). The STFT shows a broadband (low-frequency-dominated) burst there. The negative SHAP indicates this transient reduces the model's confidence in class 3 (it is evidence against walking in the model's learned mapping), possibly because the spike/trough shape at that moment matches patterns the model has associated with other classes (e.g., seizure mimic or an anomalous event).",
        "Observation: Smaller patches of red SHAP appear at a mid-low frequency band (~0.15\u20130.20 normalized) around times 55\u201395 and again 130\u2013167. Implication: The raw signal in those subintervals contains higher harmonic content (faster sub-oscillations within the main cycles) and slightly increased volatility (more sub-peaks between the major peaks and troughs). STFT confirms harmonic energy in these mid-low bands. The model treats the presence of these harmonics as additional supporting evidence for class 3 (positive SHAP), i.e., it expects not only a fundamental low-frequency rhythm but also some harmonic structure for this class.",
        "Observation: From t\u22480\u201337 the amplitude is lower and less regular (smaller peaks and a short ramp into the main oscillatory regime), with mixed weak SHAP coloration (mostly neutral/pale). Implication: This initial transient contributes little to the final decision \u2014 neither strongly supporting nor strongly opposing class 3 \u2014 and the classifier relies more on the later, clearer rhythmic cycles to form its prediction.",
        "Observation: Throughout the central time window (approx t=37\u2013149) cycle-to-cycle amplitude and shape vary modestly (some cycles show slightly shallower troughs or lower positive peaks). Implication: The classifier appears robust to moderate within-window variability and bases its decision on the presence of recurring asymmetric cycles and their spectral signature rather than exact constant amplitude. However, amplitude variability is a potential source of ambiguity between similar locomotion classes (e.g., brisk walking vs. running).",
        "Observation (time steps 37\u2013130) -> The SHAP heatmap shows a broad band of strong positive contribution (red) concentrated at the lowest frequency rows across roughly time indices 37 through 130. In the raw time series plot this interval contains a long sequence of regular, high-contrast cycles: repeated sharp positive peaks reaching approximately +0.5 to +0.95 (normalized units) and deep negative troughs between roughly -2.6 and -1.6. The peaks are narrow (rise and fall occurring in only a few samples) and recur at an approximately constant spacing (~8\u201312 time steps). Volatility within this window is moderate and consistent (peak-to-trough range remains similar cycle-to-cycle), with a slight upward drift of local minima over the window (earlier troughs more negative than later ones). Implication -> The model is using the persistent, low-frequency oscillatory energy present throughout this mid-section as strong evidence for its predicted class; the combination of regular, high-amplitude periodic swings (large, narrow positive spikes + deep troughs) yields strong low-frequency power (seen in STFT) which the model attributes positively to the predicted label.",
        "Observation (time steps ~74\u2013111, focal substructure) -> The SHAP heatmap shows particularly intense red patches around time steps ~74\u2013111 at the lowest-frequency rows and also modestly at a secondary mid-low frequency band (~0.18 row). In the corresponding raw signal this subwindow contains several of the largest and most regularly spaced pulses in the record (peak heights near the upper range ~0.8\u20130.95 and troughs around -2.4) with highly repeatable waveform shape (fast rise, brief plateau at the peak, then deeper negative return). STFT confirms a strong concentrated energy at the lowest band and a secondary sustained band at the mid-low frequency during the same interval. Implication -> These very regular, high-SNR cycles are the primary drivers of the model\u2019s positive attribution in that time range; the model associates these prominent low-frequency/mid-low-frequency spectral signatures with walking-like patterns and thus increases the predicted score for the chosen class.",
        "Observation (time steps 0\u201318) -> The SHAP heatmap contains small blue (negative) contributions at the lowest frequency row around time index ~18 and generally weaker contributions at the very start. The raw time series start shows the first cycle with a large positive spike at ~index 4 followed by a deep trough (~-2.8) then another large peak; however these initial cycles are less regular in amplitude compared with the mid-section and include one of the deepest isolated troughs in the whole series. Implication -> The model treats the early irregularity (very deep trough and abrupt amplitude change) as evidence against the predicted class (negative SHAP), likely because these extreme single-cycle deviations reduce consistency of the low-frequency pattern the model relies on. In other words, the model prefers the stable repeating pattern seen later and downweights early irregular transients.",
        "Observation (global frequency content) -> STFT shows dominant, persistent energy confined to the lowest frequency band across nearly the whole sequence and a secondary, sustained energy band around a mid-low frequency (~the 0.18 row) concentrated in the middle time segments. There is little sustained high-frequency energy. Implication -> The classifier\u2019s positive SHAP at low frequencies indicates it relies on sustained slow oscillations (arm-swing style cycles) to form its decision. The absence of strong high-frequency content means the model has little spectral evidence to distinguish faster gait dynamics (which could indicate running) and instead favors a low-frequency signature associated with walking.",
        "Observation (waveform dynamics \u2014 slopes and change rates) -> Individual cycles show very steep rising edges (high positive slope over 1\u20133 samples) and relatively fast returns to negative values, producing sharp, impulse-like positive peaks followed by deeper troughs. Across the mid-section these rates of change are stable cycle-to-cycle. Implication -> The rapid, repeatable slopes concentrate energy in low + low-mid frequency bins (depending on window size) and produce a time\u2013frequency pattern the model treats as characteristic. The model apparently weights the timing/regularity of these slopes rather than peak absolute amplitude when forming its prediction."

        "Combined interpretation and classifier behavior: The series is overall strongly periodic with repeated high-amplitude spikes and an overall asymmetric waveform (peaks larger than troughs). The classifier appears to weigh (1) the presence of periodic pulse energy in a mid-low frequency band and (2) a sustained low-frequency offset (elevated baseline and asymmetry) especially in the final portion of the recording, as positive evidence for the predicted label. Negative evidence comes from pronounced early troughs and transient low-baseline segments. Time-series dependence is present: short-time high-frequency transients (fast rises) are combined with longer-time shifts (DC offset) to form the classifier's decision; the SHAP map shows that the late-time DC-like increase tipped the decision strongly toward the predicted class.",
        "Pattern for Sample 79 (True label: RUNNING, Model predicted: WALKING):",
        "Feature A (mid-series, time steps ~55\u2013130): strong, regular asymmetric oscillations with pronounced negative baseline and stable peak-to-peak amplitude (observed in time plot) -> concentrated low-frequency energy in STFT (observed near 0.0 row) -> strong positive SHAP (red) -> model pushes toward WALKING (predicted class 3).",
        "+ Feature B (intermittent mid-low harmonic, time steps ~37 and ~74): secondary periodic component (observed as small intra-cycle ripples in the raw trace) -> measurable mid-low frequency energy in STFT (~0.15\u20130.2 row) -> positive SHAP in several columns -> supports WALKING in combination with Feature A.",
        "+ Feature C (localized higher-frequency-like transients, several short columns including ~18 and ~111): brief sharper spikes / slightly faster cycle spacing in the raw trace -> energy at mid frequencies in STFT -> negative SHAP (blue) against WALKING (these are the features that would favor RUNNING), but they are weaker/less consistent across time so they do not overcome the strong positive low-frequency evidence.",
        "+ Net effect: dominant, sustained low-frequency/asymmetric oscillation (Feature A) + supporting mid-low harmonics (Feature B) outweigh intermittent higher-frequency transients (Feature C), so the classifier assigns highest logit to WALKING (class 3) despite the true activity being RUNNING (class 1).",
        "Implication for error: the model overly weights persistent low-frequency baseline and regular cycle morphology as walking signatures; when a running sample exhibits large-amplitude, regular oscillations with a negative offset (as here) \u2014 i.e., when the cadence differences are subtle or intermittently expressed \u2014 the model can misclassify running as walking.",
        "Overall pattern summary: The sample contains two main sequential components: (1) a long stationary baseline (t \u2248 0\u201390) with a persistent DC offset (manifestation: low variance, amplitude \u22481.15\u20131.25) that is colored red in the SHAP map (heatmap interpretation: positive contribution) and (2) a sudden onset followed by sustained rhythmic oscillation (t \u2248 95\u2013207) with large asymmetric peaks and regular periodicity (manifestation: high amplitude, repeating cycles, dominant spectral energy at normalized freq \u22480.10\u20130.18) that shows mixed SHAP coloring but includes strong red at early oscillation times (heatmap interpretation: early cycles positively contribute to the model\u2019s final decision). Model result: the black\u2011box predicted class 3 (WALKING) with highest logit 2.4478; the SHAP red regions explain which time\u2013frequency features drove that output.",
        "Decomposed pattern description (concise): Component A \u2014 Baseline DC (t 0\u201390) (red): long, near\u2011constant offset with negligible volatility (model: positive evidence for predicted class). + Component B \u2014 Onset transient (t ~88\u201398) (red): sharp amplitude change and burst of energy (model: positive evidence). + Component C \u2014 Sustained low\u2011frequency oscillation (t ~95\u2013207) (mixed red/blue): regular cycles at \u22481.3\u20132.0 Hz, high peak\u2011to\u2011peak amplitude, asymmetric waveform and modest envelope modulation (model: early cycles produce positive SHAP support; some spectral bands produce negative contributions).",
        "Why the model likely labeled this as WALKING (analysis combining pattern + dataset context): the classifier appears to associate a combination of a persistent DC offset plus a low\u2011to\u2011mid frequency periodic band (\u22480.10\u20130.18 normalized, i.e. ~1.3\u20132.0 Hz) with the predicted label. The early oscillation cycles (right after onset) are the strongest positive contributors. Because walking and running both produce rhythmic wrist motion, a rhythmic frequency in this low range plus a DC offset can be mistaken for walking if the learned walking signature overlaps strongly with this spectral/temporal pattern.",
        "Misclassification drivers (dataset / signal level): (a) cadence/frequency overlap \u2014 the measured oscillation frequency here (~1.3\u20132.0 Hz) falls in a range that can overlap walking and slow running depending on subject; (b) amplitude & waveform similarity \u2014 dominant, regular arm\u2011swing oscillations (large peaks/troughs) resemble both walking and sawing patterns, increasing class confusion (note: second\u2011highest logit corresponds to SAWING at 1.039); (c) truncation and selection \u2014 the archive truncates series to a short segment (random interval), so distinctive running signatures (e.g., higher cadence or different arm dynamics) may have been truncated out or underrepresented; (d) small training set / inter\u2011subject variability \u2014 with only a few participants, the model may have learned DC + low\u2011freq oscillation as a robust cue for walking and not generalized to all running patterns.",
        "Net implication for remediation: to reduce this error, the model needs exposure to a wider variety of running wrist signatures (different cadences and amplitudes), to explicitly use higher\u2011resolution spectral features (separate harmonics) and to normalize or discount DC offsets that act as spurious anchors. Increasing training samples or adding features that distinguish cadence (cycles/sec), peak asymmetry metrics, or transient onset slope could help separate RUNNING from WALKING/SAWING.",
        "Overall feature pattern of this sample: Dominant rhythmic oscillation (occurrence t\u224837\u2013130) (manifestation: repeated asymmetric cycles \u2014 rapid positive spikes ~+0.8\u2013+1.1 then deeper negative troughs ~-1.8\u2013-3.1) (heatmap: red at low frequency ~0.07\u20130.12) (heatmap interpretation: positive contribution to predicted class 3) (model result: main reason pushing prediction toward class 3).",
        "+ Transient low-frequency burst (occurrence t\u224818) (manifestation: single very large spike & trough transient) (heatmap: blue at lowest frequency) (heatmap interpretation: negative contribution to predicted class 3) (model result: reduces confidence in class 3 but is outweighed by the dominant rhythmic band).",
        "+ Mid-low frequency harmonics (occurrence t\u224855\u201395 and t\u2248130\u2013167) (manifestation: extra sub-oscillations / increased local volatility within cycles) (heatmap: red patches at ~0.15\u20130.20) (heatmap interpretation: reinforce prediction for class 3) (model result: add supporting evidence for class 3).",
        "+ Initial transient / low-energy ramp-in (occurrence t\u22480\u201337) (manifestation: lower amplitude, irregular cycles) (heatmap: near-neutral) (heatmap interpretation: little direct influence on model output) (model result: has minor effect).",
        "Time-frequency summary: STFT energy is concentrated at low frequencies corresponding to the periodic cycles and shows harmonic components at mid-low frequencies; this spectral signature matches what the model associates with class 3 and is reflected in the red SHAP banding.",
        "Why the model likely erred (context + interpretation): The black-box predicted class 3 (WALKING) while the background indicates the sample belongs to RUNNING. The model's decision is dominated by a moderate-frequency, strongly periodic asymmetric wrist signal that visually resembles walking cadence (distinct repeated peaks and troughs with dominant low-frequency energy). Running typically exhibits either higher cadence or different amplitude/harmonic patterns on the wrist; here the cadence/amplitude/harmonic mix is closer to the model's learned walking prototype. Additional factors that likely caused confusion: (a) wrist-mounted accelerometer measures arm motion that can look similar for brisk walking and running, (b) simulated activities and small training set variability (only 6 participants) increase class overlap, and (c) the presence of transient events (e.g., the strong burst at t\u224818) produced conflicting evidence that the model partially discounted. Together these lead the classifier to favor walking despite the true label being running.",
        "Overall pattern of Sample 103: Mid-sequence regular oscillatory gait-like signal (time steps 37\u2013130) (manifestation: repeated narrow positive peaks ~+0.5 to +0.95 and deep troughs ~-2.6 to -1.6; periodic spacing ~8\u201312 samples; stable amplitude and slope) (heatmap: red at lowest frequency and mid-low freq rows) (interpretation: model-positive features) (model decision: strongly contributed to predicted class 3).",
        "Secondary supportive subpattern: Focused high-attribution band (time steps ~74\u2013111) (manifestation: the most consistent and largest cycles in the record; very repeatable peak shape and spacing) (heatmap: intense red at lowest freq \u00b1 mid-low freq) (interpretation: strongest local evidence for predicted class) (model decision: major driver of final logits favoring class 3).",
        "Contrasting early transient (time steps 0\u201318) (manifestation: one of the deepest troughs and slightly less regular cycle amplitudes) (heatmap: blue/weak negative at lowest frequency) (interpretation: evidence against the predicted class) (model decision: marginally reduced confidence locally).",
        "Frequency summary (whole sequence) (manifestation: dominant low-frequency energy throughout with a persistent secondary band around the mid-low frequency in the middle) (heatmap: red aligns with these bands) (interpretation: classifier relies on slow periodic components and their temporal consistency) (model decision: outputs high logit for class 3 because of these low-frequency cues).",
        "Result & likely error cause: The model predicted class 3 (WALKING) with a high logit despite the sample being from label 1 (RUNNING) because the extracted features (stable, strong low-frequency oscillations and consistent peak shape/spacing in the mid-segment) resemble the walking patterns the model learned. Possible dataset/model contributing factors: (a) running example in this case has cadence/amplitude that overlaps with walking in the wrist accelerometer band captured (especially after random truncation), (b) the model places primary weight on persistent low-frequency spectral energy and regularity rather than higher-frequency components or absolute cadence that better distinguish running, and (c) truncation/random window selection may have captured a portion of the running instance where stride frequency or arm swing looked more like walking, leading to misclassification."

        "Observation (time ~15\u201340 steps): Repeated, high-amplitude positive pulses with fast rise and faster fall \u2014 each cycle reaches roughly 1.8\u20132.4 (normalized units) and returns close to 0 or slightly negative. The waveform in this window is highly periodic, low within-cycle variability, and shows a sharp leading edge followed by a rapid decay (sawtooth-like). STFT support: strong, steady energy in the mid-frequency band (~0.18\u20130.25 normalized) and a persistent low-frequency/DC component. SHAP/Implication: This time-frequency region is highlighted red in the SHAP heatmap and therefore contributes positively to the model predicting 'Epilepsy' (the model interprets the regular, high-energy mid-frequency oscillation as evidence for class 0).",
        "Observation (time ~55\u201395 steps): Continued periodic oscillations similar to the earlier window but with slightly increased cycle-to-cycle amplitude variability (peaks still \u22481.9\u20132.4, troughs near 0 to -0.2). Individual cycles show consistent shape (quick rise, quick drop), with occasional cycles having a marginally slower decay. STFT support: the band around ~0.2\u20130.25 remains the dominant spectral component across time. SHAP/Implication: This region again appears red in the SHAP heatmap at both low and mid frequencies, so these regular rhythmic strokes strongly push the model toward the 'Epilepsy' prediction (the model is attributing persistent mid-frequency power to seizure-like activity).",
        "Observation (time ~90\u2013130 steps): High density of cycles with somewhat increased average energy (several peaks near the upper range of observed amplitude ~2.2\u20132.6). The waveform still exhibits the same short, sharp positive transients per cycle but with slightly more within-window amplitude fluctuation. STFT support: mid-frequency energy remains elevated and continuous; DC component persists. SHAP/Implication: This block is also red-dominant on the heatmap (low and mid frequencies), and thus strongly increases the epilepsy class score \u2014 the model treats sustained rhythmic mid-frequency power here as reinforcing seizure probability.",
        "Observation (time ~145\u2013170 steps): A pronounced, brief irregular transient: a large negative trough (the signal falls markedly below the series baseline, noticeably deeper than earlier small negative undershoots) followed by a large positive spike (one of the largest positive peaks in the series) and then a return to the periodic baseline. This segment is less regular and more volatile than prior windows. STFT support: there is a temporary change in the spectral balance (a slight shift and spread of energy away from the dominant mid-frequency). SHAP/Implication: The SHAP heatmap shows blue (negative) values in the mid-frequency band around this time, indicating this irregular transient reduces the model's epilepsy score (model views this irregular/atypical event as evidence against class 0).",
        "Observation (low-frequency/DC band across most times): Across almost the entire series there is a nonzero baseline offset (visible as a persistent low-frequency / DC component in the STFT). SHAP/Implication: The bottom rows of the SHAP heatmap (very low frequency / DC) are strongly red at several time steps (e.g., ~18\u2013111). The model attributes part of its epilepsy prediction to this persistent offset combined with periodic energy \u2014 i.e., the presence of steady baseline plus rhythmic bursts is treated as seizure-like by the classifier.",
        "Observation (substructure within each cycle): Each cycle shows a characteristic substructure: a steep ascending edge (fast positive velocity), a sharp peak, a quick descent toward baseline and a small negative undershoot before the next cycle. STFT support: this temporal sharpness explains concentrated mid-frequency energy. SHAP/Implication: Because SHAP highlights the mid-frequency rows where these substructures contribute positively, the model likely learned that such sharp, regular transients are important features for the epilepsy class and therefore gives them positive attribution even when the true activity is sawing.",
        "Observation: SHAP shows a concentrated red region (positive attribution to the model's predicted class 'Epilepsy') in the low-frequency band (~normalized frequency 0.12\u20130.18) and at the DC / very-low-frequency bin (~0.0) between time steps \u2248130\u2013170 (tick marks 130, 149, 167). -> Implication: In the raw trace this corresponds to the mid\u2013late segment (roughly the middle third to later third of the 207-point series) where the signal exhibits slightly increased low-frequency energy and a subtle upward shift of the local baseline. The model relies on increased power at the fundamental low-frequency band and DC content in that interval to push the prediction toward 'Epilepsy'.",
        "Observation: In the plot the waveform across the entire series is a highly regular, high-amplitude oscillation with a consistent period; troughs are deep and peaks are relatively narrow. Typical trough values lie near the bottom of the plot while positive excursions are much smaller, producing a noticeable negative baseline offset. -> Implication: The asymmetric shape (deeper/longer troughs vs. shorter/smaller peaks) creates energy at very low frequencies (DC) plus a strong fundamental harmonic; the model treats this spectral signature as an epilepsy cue (as shown by red SHAP at DC and the fundamental band).",
        "Observation: The local window identified by SHAP (\u2248time 130\u2013170) shows slightly higher signal magnitude at the fundamental frequency in the STFT (brighter band around normalized 0.12\u20130.18) compared with earlier windows; the STFT also shows persistent energy in the 0.0 bin across the whole series with a relative increase in that mid\u2013late window. -> Implication: The mid\u2013late segment's slight gain in low-frequency power increases the model's epilepsy logit; even small, sustained increases in the fundamental/DC energy are treated as strong positive evidence by the model.",
        "Observation: Time-domain substructure in the red-attributed interval: cycles remain periodic and low-variance in period (little jitter in cycle length), but amplitude/mean show a modest upward drift (baseline becomes less negative) compared to some earlier segments. The rise/fall shapes of each oscillation remain consistent (no abrupt transient or spike). -> Implication: The model appears to weigh sustained periodic, regular oscillations with elevated low-frequency content more heavily than transient irregularities; therefore a rhythmic activity with steady periodicity (like sawing) can be mistaken for rhythmic seizure-like signatures if only low-frequency power and regularity are used.",
        "Observation: There are small blue (negative) SHAP patches at similar low-frequency bins at earlier times (e.g., around time \u224818 and \u224874) while later times are red. -> Implication: The model's attribution is time-sensitive: earlier occurrences of the same spectral content decreased the epilepsy score (blue), while the later, slightly stronger/longer-lasting occurrences increased it. This indicates the model is sensitive to both magnitude and persistence of low-frequency power over time.",
        "Observation: The plot shows minimal nonperiodic noise or abrupt transients (no large isolated spikes); volatility (cycle-to-cycle amplitude variation) is low across the series. -> Implication: The absence of irregular spikes or sudden bursts removes features that could discriminatively indicate non-epileptic activity; the model therefore falls back on periodic low-frequency power as a dominant cue, causing confusion between repetitive activities (sawing) and seizure-mimic rhythms.",
        "Observation (time 18\u201337 steps \u2248 1.1\u20132.3 s): a very regular, high-amplitude oscillatory burst with peak values \u2248 2.0\u20132.4 and troughs \u2248 -0.5 to -0.8 (peak-to-peak \u2248 2.6\u20133.2). The waveform in this window shows consistent cycle-to-cycle shape (sharp crest, slower decay to trough), low within-window variability in period and amplitude (high regularity). STFT support: clear energy concentrated in the mid-low frequency band (~0.12\u20130.16 normalized, \u22482\u20132.4 Hz). Heatmap/SHAP: red (positive) at the same mid-low frequency band and at low-frequency (near-DC) in this time range. Implication: the model attributes these regular, high-amplitude ~2 Hz oscillations and the positive baseline/low-frequency energy strongly in favor of the predicted class (class 0). Because the motion is highly periodic and energetic here, the model treats it as a strong indicator for its predicted label.",
        "Observation (time 55\u201393 steps \u2248 3.4\u20135.8 s): sustained periodic oscillation persists but with modest amplitude modulation \u2014 individual peaks slightly vary (some cycles reach ~2.3, others ~1.8) and occasional transient larger crests (up to ~2.4). Volatility: low-to-moderate (amplitude slowly fluctuates across many cycles); trend: no long-term upward/downward drift but small local amplitude ups and downs. STFT support: continued concentrated energy at the same mid-low band (~0.12\u20130.16) and persistent low-frequency energy. SHAP: mixed (mostly light-red to red at the mid-low band, occasional blue spots at the same band). Implication: repeated, steady periodic structure continues to push the model's evidence toward the predicted class, while small local fluctuations cause the model's attribution to vary slightly (some sub-windows reduce confidence \u2014 blue \u2014 while the majority increase it).",
        "Observation (time 111\u2013130 steps \u2248 6.9\u20138.1 s): the oscillation amplitude remains high but individual cycles become slightly less symmetric (crest widths and trough depths vary). Short-lived positive excursions (peaks) appear around 116\u2013120 and 124\u2013127 steps. STFT: mid-low frequency band still prominent but with slightly more spread (some adjacent frequency bins activated). SHAP: a distinct red patch in the mid-low frequency band here. Implication: the model uses these maintained periodic bursts (and the slight broadening in frequency) as positive evidence for its chosen class; transient shape changes (less symmetry) do not flip attribution sign \u2014 they generally remain positively weighted.",
        "Observation (time 149\u2013186 steps \u2248 9.3\u201311.6 s): the final third shows continued, regular oscillations but with a modest reduction in trough depth (troughs become slightly less negative) and a small decline in overall peak magnitude near the very end (peaks fall from \u22482.2 to \u22481.8). STFT: still dominated by the same band; some low-frequency (near-DC) energy increases slightly at the very end. SHAP: red clusters at the mid-low band around 167\u2013186 and light-red at the low-frequency bin. Implication: late-window periodicity and preserved energy in the characteristic frequency band continue to be counted as positive evidence by the model; slight amplitude decay at the end gives less positive (lighter red) attribution.",
        "Observation (low-frequency / near-DC across most times 0\u2013205 steps): the series shows a consistent positive offset (baseline above zero) across the whole window with strong low-frequency energy in the STFT (bright band near the lowest-frequency bin). SHAP: low-frequency (near-DC) cells are predominantly red in early and middle times and turn neutral to slightly red later. Implication: the model treats the positive DC offset / baseline as additional positive evidence for the predicted label. In combination with the rhythmic component this baseline strengthens the model's confidence.",
        "Observation (blue (negative) SHAP spots at mid-low band around time 37\u201374 and at very-low freq around time 149\u2013167): these correspond to brief sub-windows where the periodic cycles are slightly less regular or where local wave-shape differs (e.g., slightly wider troughs or smaller adjacent peaks). Implication: the model reduces its support (negative contribution) for its predicted class in those moments, indicating sensitivity to small deviations from the canonical rhythmic template; however, those negative contributions are smaller in magnitude than the persistent positive contributions, so overall prediction remains driven by the red areas."

        "Overall pattern for Sample 109: A highly periodic, sawtooth-like motion dominates the entire 207-step series.

        "Why the model misclassified (combination interpretation): The time series corresponds to a repetitive wrist motion (sawing) that produces a strong, continuous mid-frequency spectral peak and a sustained DC/low-frequency component. In the training data the epilepsy (mimicked seizures) class also contains rhythmic, repetitive energy in similar bands. The model therefore conflates the periodic mid-frequency power + DC offset with seizure patterns and gives those time-frequency regions strong positive attribution (red SHAP). Although there is a localized irregular event (time ~145\u2013170) that would argue against epilepsy (blue SHAP), the cumulative positive contribution from the many earlier, highly regular cycles dominates the logit output (class 0 logit highest). Limited context length (truncated series), similar wrist-mounted sensor signatures for both sawing and mimicked seizure, and learned emphasis on sustained mid-frequency/DC features likely explain the classifier's error.",

        "Observation (time steps 110\u2013150, \u22482.5 s): a sequence of distinct positive spikes (peaks near 1.1, 1.45 and ~1.6) separated by brief negative troughs; each spike is relatively narrow (few time steps) on top of a slowly varying baseline. -> Implication: these repeated narrow, high-amplitude excursions at low underlying frequency are positively weighted toward epilepsy (heatmap: red at low-frequency rows for these time columns). The model appears to treat repeated bursts of energy as seizure-like signatures.",
        "Observation (time steps 167\u2013186, \u22481.2 s): prolonged negative-going oscillations with trough depths ~ -1.3 to -1.5 and intermittent small rebounds. -> Implication: despite their negative sign, the SHAP heatmap shows red in low-frequency bins here (positive contribution to epilepsy). This indicates the model relies on the magnitude/energy in low-frequency bands rather than polarity; sustained low-frequency oscillation magnitude boosts the epilepsy score.",
        "Observation (time steps 0\u201318, \u22481.1 s): an initial fast rise to a large positive peak (~ +2.7 to +2.9) within the first ~8\u201310 steps, then a very steep fall to a deep negative trough (~ -2.4) by ~18. -> Implication: SHAP shows strong blue (negative contribution) at the lowest frequencies for this early window. The model treats this early abrupt biphasic extreme (large positive then large negative) as evidence against epilepsy\u2014possibly because such a transient differs from the model's learned seizure pattern (it reduces the epilepsy logit).",
        "Observation (frequency domain, STFT): energy is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins across the entire sequence, with intermittent increases of low-frequency magnitude at the same time ranges flagged red by SHAP (notable at ~74\u2013111, ~110\u2013150 and ~167\u2013186). -> Implication: the classifier is primarily sensitive to low-frequency energy patterns (very low-frequency bands) when predicting epilepsy. Walking motion in this dataset also produces strong low-frequency components, causing overlap in feature space.",
        "Observation (volatility & change rate): the series alternates between low-volatility intervals (small oscillations around a baseline) and brief high-volatility events (sharp spikes/dips). High-volatility spikes are narrow in time (fast change rate) and often ride on top of slower oscillations. -> Implication: the model appears to combine both slow envelope energy and the presence of narrow high-amplitude transients as evidence for epilepsy; when both co-occur (as in several middle windows), SHAP shows strongest positive contribution.",
        "Observation (temporal dependence / periodicity): peaks and troughs repeat with approximate spacing of ~15\u201330 time steps (\u22480.9\u20131.9 s), i.e., quasi-periodic low-frequency oscillations with superimposed transient peaks. -> Implication: this cadence-like repetition is consistent with wrist motion during walking (periodic limb swings). The model has likely learned repetition of low-frequency bursts as a seizure cue, explaining its confusion.",
        "Observation (model confidence): logits show a strong positive logit for Epilepsy (3.12) and a negative logit for Walking (-1.84). SHAP attributions concentrate on the low-frequency rows and the middle/late time windows (red). -> Implication: the model is confident in the epilepsy prediction because multiple time windows present sustained low-frequency energy plus bursts that match its learned seizure signature; however those same signatures plausibly originate from walking motion in this dataset.",
        "Observation (t\u224836\u201356): The signal rises sharply from \u2248-1.5 to a sustained positive plateau around +1.0\u2013+1.7 over ~10\u201320 time steps (rapid upward slope followed by low volatility). STFT: concentrated energy at the very low-frequency band (near 0) during this interval. SHAP: strong red at low frequencies in this same time window. -> Implication: A large, slow DC-like positive deflection (smooth plateau) is being interpreted by the model as a strong positive cue for class 0 (epilepsy). The combination of a fast rise and then a sustained offset increases low-frequency energy, which the model treats as diagnostic for seizures in this dataset.",
        "Observation (t\u224874\u201393): The series exhibits a sharp downward trough (to \u2248-1.5) followed within a few steps by a rebound spike up to \u2248+0.5\u2013+0.8 and then short-term oscillation. STFT: low-frequency content remains elevated (red shading in SHAP around 0\u20130.15 band); mid-low band (~0.1\u20130.2) also shows positive contributions. -> Implication: The model attributes the transient trough+rebound (a slow, large-amplitude excursion) as evidence for class 0; the sustained slow oscillation / rebound increases low-frequency magnitude which the classifier learned to associate with epileptic events.",
        "Observation (t\u2248105\u2013130): The signal shows a gradual rising trend from slightly negative to repeated positive peaks (peaks ~+0.5\u2013+1.2) with moderate volatility (several local maxima separated by several time steps). STFT/SHAP: pronounced positive SHAP values concentrated at the lowest frequency bins across this interval. -> Implication: Extended low-frequency modulation and repeated slow peaks in this mid-late window provide cumulative positive contribution toward the epilepsy prediction \u2014 the model favors persistent slow modulations over short high-frequency jitter.",
        "Observation (t\u2248140\u2013150): A distinct single sharp positive spike (to ~+1.2) occurs over a few time steps then returns toward baseline. STFT: localized low-frequency energy increase around that time; SHAP: red at low frequencies for this time column. -> Implication: The classifier marks isolated, high-amplitude slow spikes as supportive of class 0, treating them similarly to sustained plateaus because they increase low-frequency magnitude in the time-frequency representation used by the model.",
        "Observation (t\u22480\u201336): Early segment shows relatively high volatility with repeated faster oscillations between about -0.8 and -2.8 (higher-frequency content relative to later windows). STFT/SHAP: this region shows weaker or slightly negative SHAP contributions at the lowest-frequency bins (some blue). -> Implication: Faster, higher-frequency oscillatory motion reduces the model's epilepsy score (i.e., it pushes away from class 0). In other words, high-frequency jitter is interpreted as evidence against seizure by the model for this dataset.",
        "Observation (t\u2248167\u2013195): There is a downward drift to a minimum (\u2248-2.2) followed by an upward recovery toward ~-1.0 and ending around +0.3. STFT/SHAP: low-frequency band again shows red contributions (particularly during the recovery). -> Implication: Slow directional drifts and the final slow recovery are again treated as positive epilepsy cues. The model accumulates positive evidence whenever the low-frequency power increases, even if the instantaneous sign changes (negative trough then slow rise).",
        "Observation (frequency domain overall): The STFT shows dominant energy concentrated at the very low-frequency bins (near 0) across the time span where SHAP is red; there is little sustained high-frequency energy. -> Implication: The model strongly weights energy in the near-DC / very-low-frequency band when attributing to class 0. Time-local increases in this band (plateaus, slow rises/falls, and broad spikes) are the primary drivers of the model's epilepsy prediction for this sample.",
        "Observation -> Implication: Time steps 110\u2013135 (approx. index 110 to 135; ~6.9\u20138.4 s) \u2014 The trace exhibits a rapid upward ramp from around 0 to sustained peaks in the 2.0\u20133.0 range with several sharp local maxima and a plateau-like period lasting ~15\u201325 samples. STFT: a very strong concentration of energy in the lowest frequency bins occurs at the same times (bright yellow in STFT). SHAP: this region is strongly red in the heatmap (large positive SHAP values). Implication: The model treats this sudden, high-amplitude, low-frequency burst (fast onset + sustained elevation) as a seizure-like signature and heavily increases the epilepsy (label 0) logit.",
        "Observation -> Implication: Time steps ~16\u201325 (approx. index 16\u201325; ~1.0\u20131.6 s) \u2014 The series contains two sharp, short-duration positive spikes (peaks \u22481.9\u20132.2) with steep rise/fall (high change rate over 2\u20134 samples). STFT: modest low-frequency energy co-occurs with these transients. SHAP: these locations are red (positive contribution). Implication: The model interprets abrupt high-magnitude transients as supporting evidence for epilepsy, so these short spikes push the prediction toward label 0.",
        "Observation -> Implication: Time steps ~90\u2013110 (approx. index 90\u2013110; ~5.6\u20136.9 s) \u2014 The signal shows several medium-amplitude excursions (\u00b10.5\u20131.2) and a brief upward trend immediately before the major burst. STFT: increased low-frequency content begins to appear in this window. SHAP: this region shows light-to-moderate red values. Implication: The model appears to accumulate rising low-frequency energy and pre-burst activity as additional evidence of an event similar to a seizure onset, increasing confidence for epilepsy.",
        "Observation -> Implication: Time steps ~150\u2013170 (approx. index 150\u2013170; ~9.4\u201310.6 s) \u2014 After the mid-sequence burst, the series falls rapidly to negative values (down to \u2248-1.3 to -1.5) and then oscillates with lower amplitude and faster changes. STFT: lower low-frequency power and more spread energy. SHAP: this region contains blue/neutral cells (negative or weak SHAP values). Implication: The model treats this post-burst negative dip and faster oscillation as evidence against epilepsy (it reduces the epilepsy logit), perhaps because it diverges from the sustained low-frequency pattern it associates with seizures.",
        "Observation -> Implication: Time steps late window ~186\u2013205 (approx. index 186\u2013205; ~11.6\u201312.8 s) \u2014 The series returns to small positive excursions (peaks \u22480.8\u20131.1) with moderate volatility. STFT: low-frequency energy is present but weak. SHAP: light red in some low-frequency bins at these times. Implication: These weaker, late positive oscillations give a small additional push toward epilepsy but are much weaker than the central burst; the model partially weights them as supporting but not decisive evidence.",
        "Observation -> Implication: Frequency-domain note across the sequence \u2014 Most of the SHAP-positive regions align with the lowest frequency bands (lowest rows in the SHAP heatmap and the bright low-frequency band in the STFT). Implication: The model strongly associates energy concentrated at low frequencies (slow, sustained deviations or plateaus) with epilepsy; therefore any activity that produces sustained DC/very-low-frequency shifts (e.g., a prolonged upward wrist acceleration during walking gestures) will bias the classifier toward label 0.",
        "Observation -> Implication: Substructure distinction \u2014 The model appears to treat (a) abrupt short spikes (very fast rise/fall) and (b) longer sustained low-frequency plateaus both as positive cues for epilepsy (both appear as red in SHAP), whereas rapid alternating oscillations or post-burst negative dips are treated as negative cues (blue). Implication: This suggests the classifier uses a combination of amplitude magnitude, onset rapidity, and sustained low-frequency power as its decision logic rather than precise periodic gait features.",
        "Observation (time \u2248 120\u2013150 samples, centered \u2248 130\u2013140): A very large, asymmetric oscillation: a sharp positive crest (peak \u2248 +1.3 to +1.5) closely followed by a deep negative trough (down to \u2248 -2.0 to -2.2). The rise-to-peak is relatively quick and the following fall is very steep (change on the order of ~3.3\u20133.7 normalized units across ~8\u201318 samples). STFT: strong low-frequency power concentrated at the lowest frequency bands at the same time (bright band in STFT). SHAP: this region is the strongest red region (largest positive SHAP values). Implication -> The model heavily weights large-amplitude, low-frequency transient swings (an asymmetric spike+trough) as evidence for the epilepsy class. The shape (high amplitude + slow/low-frequency content) and fast change rate make this segment highly salient for the epilepsy prediction.",
        "Observation (time \u2248 100\u2013115 samples): A deep negative deflection reaching \u2248 -2.0 to -2.2, produced by a fairly steep downward slope from the immediately preceding local maximum. The deflection is broad enough (several samples wide) that STFT shows elevated low-frequency energy around this window. SHAP: moderate-to-strong red contribution at low frequencies here. Implication -> The model treats large-magnitude negative excursions (not only positive spikes) at low frequencies as supporting evidence for epilepsy; magnitude and duration (broad low-frequency deflection) increase its positive attribution toward the epilepsy class.",
        "Observation (time \u2248 65\u201395 samples, centered \u2248 74\u201393): Repeated mid-sequence positive peaks (~+1.1 to +1.3) and following moderate dips; amplitude is lower than the central event but still large compared with baseline. Volatility: moderate, with distinct peak\u2013valley substructures every ~20\u201335 samples. STFT: elevated low-frequency energy (less than the central event but noticeable). SHAP: consistently red (positive) in low-frequency bands across this interval. Implication -> The model recognizes recurring moderate-amplitude, low-frequency oscillations as further supporting evidence for the epilepsy prediction; the repetition (several cycles) reinforces the model\u2019s seizure-like interpretation.",
        "Observation (time \u2248 0\u201325 samples): Low-to-moderate amplitude oscillations (range roughly -1.6 to +0.6) with lower volatility than the mid/late windows. STFT: low but nonzero low-frequency content. SHAP: light red in the lowest frequency bands (small positive contribution). Implication -> Early weak swings provide a small positive push toward the epilepsy class but are much less influential than the larger mid/late low-frequency events.",
        "Observation (higher-frequency bands across multiple times): Patches of blue/near-zero SHAP values at mid frequencies (\u22480.08\u20130.2 on the plot) especially around later times (\u2248150\u2013170) indicate negative contributions to epilepsy prediction (i.e., those components push the model away from epilepsy). STFT: little energy at those mid frequencies overall. Implication -> The model is somewhat counter-balanced by small mid-frequency content or short, faster oscillations, but these are insufficient to overcome the dominant low-frequency, large-amplitude evidence."

      "pattern": [
        "Pattern: Low-frequency energy + transient bursts (occurrence time ~74\u2013150, manifestation: sustained very-low-frequency envelope with embedded narrow positive spikes and repeated bursts, heatmap color: red -> positive contribution to Epilepsy) (model result: model predicts Epilepsy with high confidence).",
        "Pattern: Early extreme biphasic transient (occurrence time ~0\u201318, manifestation: very fast rise to large positive peak then sharp fall to deep negative trough, heatmap color: blue -> negative contribution to Epilepsy) (model result: this early transient reduces epilepsy score).",
        "Pattern: Late sustained negative oscillation (occurrence time ~167\u2013186, manifestation: prolonged negative-going low-frequency oscillation with moderate magnitude, heatmap color: red -> positive contribution to Epilepsy) (model result: adds to epilepsy evidence even though polarity is negative, since the model relies on low-frequency energy magnitude).",
        "Combined interpretation: The sample's global pattern is dominated by quasi-periodic low-frequency oscillations (walking-like cadence) with intermittent narrow high-amplitude spikes. The classifier has learned to treat sustained low-frequency energy and repeated bursts as hallmarks of Epilepsy (red areas in SHAP), so the combination of (middle-window low-frequency envelope + embedded spikes) pushed the model to predict Epilepsy. The early biphasic extreme, despite being distinctive, had a negative effect (blue) and was insufficient to overcome the positive evidence from the middle and late low-frequency energy, producing a confident but incorrect Epilepsy prediction for this true Walking sample.",
        "Feature pattern of Sample 51 is: Large slow deflection and low-frequency energy bursts (t\u224836\u201356: rapid rise into a sustained positive plateau; low volatility; SHAP red at near-0 Hz; pushes model toward epilepsy) + Slow trough+rebound and mid-segment repeated slow peaks (t\u224874\u201393 and t\u2248105\u2013130: large-amplitude slow excursions and repeated slow peaks; SHAP red in 0\u20130.2 band; cumulative positive contribution) + Isolated slow high-amplitude spike (t\u2248140\u2013150: single positive spike; SHAP red; positive contribution) + Early high-frequency oscillatory noise (t\u22480\u201336: faster oscillations with higher volatility; SHAP slight blue at low frequencies; negative contribution) + Late slow drift and recovery (t\u2248167\u2013195: slow downward then upward trend; SHAP red; positive contribution). Combined, the classifier relies on increases in very-low-frequency (near-DC) power (plateaus, slow rises/falls and broad spikes) as indicators of class 0 (epilepsy). Because this walking sample contains several such low-frequency, large-amplitude slow events, the model strongly favors epilepsy (predicted class 0, logit 3.79) despite the true activity being walking (label 3). Thus the error likely stems from the model learning low-frequency/Sustained-offset patterns as seizure signatures and misattributing similar slow deflections in a walking recording to that class.",
        "Overall pattern: The sample combines three main temporal motifs that the model uses (and combines) to reach its decision: (1) early short transients (time ~16\u201325) (sharp positive spikes) (red in SHAP) (model treats as supporting epilepsy) + (2) a dominant mid-sequence event (time ~110\u2013135) (rapid onset to sustained high amplitude, strong low-frequency energy in STFT) (strong red in SHAP) (primary driver of the epilepsy prediction) + (3) a later decay/negative dip and faster oscillation (time ~150\u2013170) (negative trough and higher-frequency oscillation) (blue/neutral in SHAP) (reduces epilepsy evidence). The classifier aggregates the positive contributions from (1) and especially (2), producing a large positive logit for epilepsy despite later contradictory evidence.",
        "Temporal dependence and combination: The model appears to be sensitive to both instantaneous amplitude features (sharp spikes) and accumulated low-frequency energy over contiguous windows. The mid-sequence sustained high amplitude (low-frequency) event has the largest SHAP contribution, and earlier spikes add incremental support. Later opposing structure (negative dip and faster oscillations) partially counteracts the evidence but not enough to overcome the accumulated positive contributions. Thus the classifier's decision is formed by additive effects across time windows, with sustained low-frequency bursts weighted most heavily.",
        "Relation to dataset background and source of error: In this dataset walking includes different paces and arm gestures; such gestures can produce transient high amplitudes and prolonged low-frequency shifts (e.g., a long forward swing or a gesture held mid-stride). The model has evidently learned to associate sudden, sustained low-frequency/large-amplitude events with seizures (label 0). Because walking-with-gesture can produce very similar signal motifs (particularly the mid-sequence sustained surge), the model confuses walking for epilepsy. The SHAP map shows the model over-relies on low-frequency amplitude bursts and short large spikes rather than context (e.g., repeated rhythmic step frequency or longer temporal context) that would discriminate walking from seizure mimicking in this dataset.",
        "Conclusion about misclassification: The strong positive logits for label 0 arise from aggregation of several red regions (especially the large mid-window low-frequency burst). The model's bias toward interpreting sustained low-frequency high-amplitude events and brief spikes as seizure signatures explains why a walking sample that contains such gestures was misclassified as epilepsy.",
        "Overall pattern of Sample 54: Repeated large-amplitude, low-frequency oscillations occurring roughly every 20\u201340 samples (periodic-looking peaks and troughs) + Strong isolated asymmetric spike\u2013trough event at ~130\u2013140 samples (manifestation: very large amplitude, steep slope, broad low-frequency content) (red in SHAP at low frequencies -> positive contribution to epilepsy prediction -> drove model to predict epilepsy) + Earlier recurring moderate peaks around ~65\u201395 samples (manifestation: repeated \u00b11.1 amplitude swings, lower volatility than the central event) (red in SHAP low-frequency bands -> moderate positive contribution) + Small early swings at 0\u201325 samples (manifestation: lower amplitude, low volatility) (light red in SHAP low-frequency bands -> weak positive contribution) + Patches of mid-frequency, lower-magnitude activity around later times (manifestation: faster, smaller fluctuations) (blue/neutral in SHAP -> negative or negligible contribution to epilepsy) => Net effect: the classifier\u2019s decision was dominated by large, slow (low-frequency) magnitude swings (especially the central asymmetric event), which the model interprets as seizure-like; therefore the model produced a high logit for epilepsy despite this sample's true class being walking."
