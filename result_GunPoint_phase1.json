        "Baseline (pre-action) (occurrence ~t=0\u201340): stable negative offset (values typically ~-0.6 to -1.3 depending on sample). Morphology: low-variance, slowly varying baseline with small low-amplitude bulges in some samples (e.g., small valley around t~15\u201325 in Samples 1, 3, 5). Time-frequency: weak energy concentrated at the 0Hz row and immediately adjacent low-frequency rows (indicates DC/slow bias). Heatmap mapping: generally neutral-to-weakly red (small positive SHAP) or near-zero in some samples \u2014 interpreted as mildly typical or background-supporting features for the label (not strongly discriminative).",
        "Pre-raise small valley/jitter (occurrence ~t=10\u201330 in some samples): small transient valley or bulge before the main rise (amplitude ~0.1\u20130.4 relative units). Time-frequency: weak, slightly broader low-frequency content (0Hz + adjacent rows). Heatmap mapping: sometimes slightly red (Sample 1, Sample 5) indicating the model treats this small pre-movement as modestly typical; in other samples this region is near-neutral in SHAP (ambiguous).",
        "Rapid rising transition (occurrence ~t=40\u201365 across samples): steep upward slope (large positive first derivative) where hand moves from baseline up to raised position. Morphology: sharp monotonic increase over ~10\u201325 time steps; amplitude increase from baseline (~-1) to plateau (~+1.0 to +1.8). Time-frequency: concentrated high energy at the lowest frequency rows (0Hz row and immediate adjacent low frequencies) with sometimes a small spread into slightly higher low-frequency components (indicating a fast low-frequency transient rather than high-frequency jitter). Heatmap mapping: predominantly red at the 0Hz row and adjacent low-frequency rows in this time window for most samples (Samples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) \u2014 interpreted as a typical, highly discriminative feature for label 0 (drawing/raising action). In a couple of samples there is a small presence of blue at adjacent low-frequency rows concurrent with the rise (Sample 2 and Sample 4 show small blue patches), indicating slight model confusion or that some specific spectral content of the transition is atypical in those cases.",
        "Raised/hold plateau (occurrence ~t=55\u201395 depending on sample): sustained positive amplitude (stable hold) with low variance during the one-second point/aim pose. Morphology: flat or gently varying plateau; amplitude range typically +1.0 to +1.8 depending on sample. Time-frequency: strong, concentrated energy dominated by the 0Hz row (a DC/low-frequency component consistent with a maintained offset) and little energy in high-frequency bands. Heatmap mapping: strongly red on the 0Hz row for the central plateau time windows in most samples (Samples 1, 2, 3, 5 show clear red dominance at low freq/time). This indicates the model treats sustained elevated hand position as a core, typical feature of the 'gun-draw' label. In Sample 4 the plateau region remains generally red at low frequencies but also shows some scattered weak blue in higher low-frequency rows (slight ambiguity).",
        "Rapid falling transition (occurrence ~t=95\u2013115 across samples): steep negative slope returning from plateau to baseline. Morphology: sharp decline over ~10\u201320 time steps; amplitude drop back to negative baseline. Time-frequency: elevated energy again concentrated at 0Hz and adjacent low frequencies; in some samples a bit more spread into intermediate rows indicating small post-motion oscillation. Heatmap mapping: often red at the 0Hz row in the falling window indicating typical feature (the model expects a return motion). However, Sample 4 shows a noticeable blue patch near the falling transition (strong negative SHAP around t~75\u201395 in some low-frequency rows) indicating that certain spectral characteristics of the fall in that sample are atypical and may slightly contradict the canonical pattern.",
        "Post-action baseline (occurrence ~t=110\u2013149): return to negative baseline similar to pre-action. Morphology: low variance, often slight additional small dips/peaks late (small negative bulge near t~135\u2013145 in Samples 1, 3, 5). Time-frequency: weak, concentrated at 0Hz and immediate rows. Heatmap mapping: mostly neutral or slightly red at low-frequency rows in several samples; meaning the stable return-to-baseline is generally typical but not as discriminative as the rise/plateau.",
        "Localized higher-frequency/energy spread (occurrence sporadic in rising/falling windows for some samples): in a few samples (e.g., Sample 2 during the rise) there is slightly broader energy distribution across adjacent low-frequency rows (wider vertical spread in STFT). Morphology in the line: small jitter or quicker micro-oscillations riding on top of the slope. Heatmap mapping: this broader spread sometimes corresponds to a mix of red and blue \u2014 model finds core low-frequency DC energy typical but the extra spread (micro-jitters) ambiguous or atypical (blue in Sample 2 and Sample 4 in localized cells)."

Onset/rise (time ~30\u201340): fast rise from ~-1.2 to ~1.0, STFT: concentrated DC/very-low-frequency energy; heatmap: clear red in the 0Hz and adjacent rows for the rise window => rise is a typical positive-label feature.

Heatmap: the plateau low-frequency region shows red and some neutral areas => plateau treated as typical. Descent (time ~105\u2013125): rapid fall back to ~-1.2 with pronounced change; STFT energy and some spread into higher rows around the fall.

Heatmap mapping: mostly very light-red / near-zero contributions across many frequency rows but with localized light-blue at the lowest frequency (0 Hz) near t \u2248 30\u201345 in some adjacent cells. Interpretation: baseline is nominally a typical gun-draw baseline (low variance, negative offset) but the small localized low-frequency blue marking near t \u2248 30\u201345 makes this baseline slightly atypical for the gun class in the model's eyes.",

Heatmap mapping: strong red concentrated at 0 Hz and nearby low-frequency rows in the t \u2248 60\u201390 window.

Heatmap mapping: light-blue / near-zero in low-frequency rows across this late segment.

Heatmap mapping: main descent region shows weak red/neutral at 0 Hz, while the short higher-frequency bleed is neutral-to-light-blue in adjacent rows.

Manifestation: short-lived broader frequency spread in STFT (more frequency rows involved) indicating small jitters.

In Sample 9 these atypical low-frequency notches and transition high-frequency bleeds together outweigh the plateau's positive evidence just enough to flip the classification (logits near zero indicate a sample very close to the decision boundary). Therefore the classification-boundary pattern is: pronounced mid-plateau (typical/red) + localized pre-rise low-frequency valley (strongly atypical/blue) + late small bump/transition jitter (atypical/blue) = net shift to misclassification.",
        "Pattern interpretation and boundary explanation (True label presumed = gun (0); Model predicted = 1 with logits [-0.1760, 0.3007]): The dominant structure is a textbook gun-draw waveform: stable negative baseline (t 0\u201350) + steep rise (t 54\u201370) + sustained flat plateau (t 60\u201390) + descent back to baseline (t 90\u2013108). The plateau is strongly red in the SHAP heatmap (0 Hz low-frequency band) and yields the largest positive contribution. However, this strong canonical signature is counter-weighed by two localized atypical low-frequency events: (1) a pronounced pre-rise low-frequency notch (t \u2248 45\u201355) that is strongly blue at 0 Hz and (2) a late small secondary bump/oscillation during the return (t \u2248 108\u2013125) that is also blue. Additionally, small mixed-frequency pixels at the rise onset and faint higher-frequency bleed at descent/transition further reduce net positive SHAP. Net effect: the large positive mass from the plateau is nearly balanced by negative SHAP contributions from the pre-rise notch and late bump together with transition jitter, moving the sample across the decision boundary toward the pointing class (resulting logits near zero and prediction = 1).",
        "Which features create the classification boundary: The critical boundary-producing combination is: strong mid-plateau (typical, red, large positive) + localized pre-rise low-frequency valley (atypical, blue, large negative) + late small secondary bump/transition jitter (atypical/blue) + minor mixed-frequency irregularities at rise onset (ambiguous). The two atypical low-frequency events (pre-rise and post-descent) produce disproportionately negative SHAP contributions compared to their amplitude, and combined they outweigh enough plateau evidence to flip the model's decision.",
        "Comparison to preliminary summary: The preliminary feature summary already identifies the same principal events (negative baseline with micro-bulges, pre-rise notch, steep rise and sustained plateau concentrated at 0 Hz, descent with secondary bump, late baseline drift and small high-frequency transition energy). Therefore the primary boundary features and the pattern causing misclassification for Sample 42 are already captured in the preliminary summary; the model\u2019s confusion is explained by the strong plateau being counteracted by low-frequency atypical notches and late small oscillations that the model treats as pointing-like evidence.",
        "Comprehensive sample analysis and boundary-pattern explanation (Sample ID 37). Summary: The sample presents a canonical gun-draw waveform in the central segment (steep ascent into a sustained plateau and a smooth descent back to baseline) but is accompanied by two small localized atypical low-frequency events (an early pre-rise low-frequency negative contribution and a late post-descent small oscillation). These atypical low-frequency events are marked blue in the SHAP heatmap and meaningfully subtract from the large positive contribution of the mid-plateau, pushing the model\u2019s logits across the decision boundary toward the pointing class. This explanation is fully consistent with the preliminary feature summary; there are no omitted misclassification-causing features in the preliminary summary for this sample. Detailed stepwise evidence follows.\n\nEarly stage (t \u2248 0\u201345): baseline and pre-rise microfeatures\n- Plot manifestation: The early segment is a steady negative baseline centered near roughly -0.7 to -0.6 with very low variance; small slow micro-bulges or tiny upward bumps are visible especially in the t \u2248 20\u201340 window. Immediately before the main rise, there is a modest deviation \u2014 a small local dip/irregularity/negative notch relative to the baseline that turns into the main ascent. Morphology: low-amplitude (\u22480.05\u20130.15) local deviations, low volatility otherwise. \n- STFT mapping: low overall energy in early stage, with a modest low-frequency presence right before the rise. \n- SHAP/heatmap mapping: this pre-rise interval is marked blue (strongly negative SHAP) at the lowest-frequency row (0 Hz) and light-blue in adjacent low-frequency rows. Interpretation: the model treats the pre-rise notch and the localized low-frequency signature in this early period as atypical for the gun class (evidence toward pointing). This is a major negative contributor to the gun class score.\n\nRise and mid-stage plateau (t \u2248 50\u201395): the canonical gun feature\n- Plot manifestation: A steep, mostly monotonic ascent begins near t \u2248 50 and reaches a sustained flat-top plateau roughly between t \u2248 60 and t \u2248 90. Amplitude change is large (from \u2248 -0.6 baseline to \u2248 +1.7\u20131.8 at plateau). Morphology: sharp slope over \u224812\u201320 time steps; plateau is broad and low volatility. \n- STFT mapping: concentrated energy tightly localized at the lowest-frequency bin (0 Hz) and immediate neighbors during plateau, indicating the sustained DC-like high segment. \n- SHAP/heatmap mapping: this central region is strongly red at 0 Hz (dominant positive SHAP), meaning the model recognizes the sustained plateau as the canonical supportive feature for the gun label. This region supplies the largest positive contribution to the gun score.\n\nLate stage (t \u2248 95\u2013149): descent and return baseline\n- Plot manifestation: A smooth descent from the plateau returns the signal to near the original negative baseline around t \u2248 100\u2013115. After return, there is a small secondary positive bump/oscillation around t \u2248 110\u2013125 followed by a slightly drifting negative baseline with small jitter (t \u2248 120\u2013149). Amplitude of the secondary bump is small (\u22480.05\u20130.2 relative to immediate surroundings). \n- STFT mapping: the main descent shows low-frequency energy; the small secondary bump injects limited higher-frequency spread for a short time. \n- SHAP/heatmap mapping: the descent is near-neutral or weakly red at 0 Hz, but the late small oscillation and the post-return drift are marked blue (negative SHAP) in the 0 Hz row and light-blue in adjacent rows. Interpretation: the late bump is treated as atypical for gun and subtracts from the net positive evidence.\n\nBoundary mechanics and model decision: why the sample is misclassified\n- Net effect: the central plateau gives a large positive SHAP mass toward class 0 (gun). However, two localized atypical low-frequency events \u2014 (1) the pronounced pre-rise low-frequency notch (t \u2248 40\u201355) and (2) the late small secondary bump/oscillation during the return-to-baseline (t \u2248 108\u2013125) \u2014 are strongly blue in the SHAP heatmap and provide disproportionately large negative contributions. Minor mixed-frequency bleed during the transitions also yields faint blue/white marks that increase ambiguity. The aggregated negative SHAP from these atypical events nearly cancels the strong plateau evidence, leaving model logits close to zero (logits: [-0.0468, 0.1181]) and producing a prediction of class 1 (pointing). The sample therefore sits very near the classification boundary.\n\nCoverage relative to the preliminary feature summary: The preliminary summary already documents all of these elements for label 0 and explicitly includes Sample 37\u2019s pattern (early micro-bulges and pre-rise notch, steep rise and sustained low-frequency plateau, descent and late small oscillations, and the SHAP interpretations). No additional misclassification-causing features or unexplained patterns are present beyond what the preliminary summary covers. Therefore there are no omissions to add for this sample."

Heatmap color: mostly light red at 0Hz-row and adjacent very-low-frequency rows in several samples (e.g., Samples 2,3,4,5 show clear red at early low-frequency bins). Interpretation: marked as a typical feature of label 1 (red \u2192 model regards this baseline as supporting the current label). This baseline itself is not the cause of misclassification but is a context feature the model expects for label 1.",
        "Rapid rise (onset, ~t=45\u201360): sharp upward slope from baseline to peak. Manifestation: large positive first derivative localized in a ~10\u201320 time-step interval (fast rise), amplitude change approximately from -0.65 to +1.0\u2013+2.3 (\u0394 ~1.6\u20133.0 depending on sample). Time-frequency: concentrated low-frequency energy but localized in time (large transient). Heatmap color: mixed\u2014some low-frequency components show blue (atypical) in the rising window in Samples 1 and 3, while others show neutral/light red in Samples 2 and 5. Interpretation: when the rise is steeper and larger in amplitude the model marks parts of this rise as atypical (blue) \u2014 this contributes to pushing the prediction away from label 1.",
        "Sustained plateau/hold (mid phase, ~t=60\u201390): prolonged high positive amplitude (the hand remains elevated). Manifestation: long-duration positive plateau with low within-plateau volatility; amplitude ranges between ~+1.5 and +2.3 (largest across samples). STFT: strong concentrated energy at the 0Hz row and immediate low-frequency rows (dominant low-frequency energy because the signal stays elevated). Heatmap color: predominantly blue in the plateau time region at the 0Hz and adjacent low-frequency rows for many samples (notably Samples 1 and 3 show clear blue around the plateau; Samples 2,4,5 show mixed but substantial blue). Interpretation: the sustained high-level plateau is treated by the black-box model as an atypical feature for label 1 (blue) \u2014 this is a primary driver of misclassification, since it resembles features of the other class (gun draw) in the model's learned representation.",
        "Descent / crossing through zero (late mid-phase, ~t=90\u2013105): downward slope back toward baseline producing a crossing of y=0. Manifestation: moderate to sharp negative slope; amplitude change from plateau (~+1.5\u2013+2.0) down across 0 to negative. Heatmap color: mixed; some low-frequency bins near the descent are blue (Samples 1 and 3 show blue signals during descent), while several samples show slight red markings at the crossing or just after (Samples 2 and 5 show light red in some low-frequency bins around descent). Interpretation: when descent behaviour resembles the two-stroke motion (distinct draw and return) the model flags it as atypical for pointing (blue), increasing misclassification risk; mixed red/blue indicates model confusion in some samples.",
        "Negative undershoot / return valley (late phase, ~t=100\u2013125): small negative valley below baseline (amplitudes ~-0.6 to -1.0) after return. Manifestation: short-lived negative trough (undershoot) with slight local oscillation or small jitter. STFT: low-frequency energy during the trough plus small higher-frequency spread if jitter present. Heatmap color: generally light red at low-frequency rows for the trough in several samples (Samples 2 and 4 show low-frequency red near the valley) but tiny blue patches can appear if the trough is deeper or oscillatory. Interpretation: the undershoot is sometimes regarded as typical (red) but when deeper or accompanied by quick oscillation it may be marked atypical (blue); however this feature is not the primary misclassification cause.",
        "Low-frequency dominance (time-frequency signature overall): across all samples the energy during the main event is concentrated at the 0Hz row and adjacent very-low-frequency rows (stable sustained elevation produces strong DC/very-low-frequency components). Manifestation: STFT panels show bright yellow/green at the 0Hz row during plateau (~t=55\u201395). Heatmap color: this same low-frequency region is often colored blue in the SHAP heatmaps for the plateau (Samples 1\u20135 show pronounced low-frequency SHAP coloration), indicating the model interprets this low-frequency, sustained energy during the mid-window as atypical for label 1 and more characteristic of the other class.",
        "Absence of high-frequency jitter (morphology detail): plateaus and transitions are largely smooth; there is little broad, high-frequency spread in STFT. Manifestation: time-frequency images show narrow-band (low-frequency) energy rather than dispersed high-frequency bands. Heatmap color: because of the narrow-band low-frequency dominance the SHAP heatmaps focus on the 0Hz/very-low-freq rows; the lack of high-frequency dispersion reduces presence of red supportive high-frequency features and allows the model's learned low-frequency patterns (which it associates with the other class) to dominate. Interpretation: smooth, sustained plateaus (low-frequency-only) are more likely to be flagged atypical (blue) for the pointing class and cause misclassification."

        "Overall reflection on misclassification: in these boundary pointing examples the features that most push the model to predict the opposite class are (1) large-amplitude, sustained positive plateaus (long hold) and (2) a clear two-phase temporal morphology (rise, long hold, descent/undershoot). In the STFT this maps to concentrated low-frequency (0Hz) energy during the event. The SHAP heatmaps consistently mark the plateau low-frequency cells as blue (atypical for label 1), so the model down-weights typical baseline features (red) and up-weights the atypical sustained-energy signature \u2014 this imbalance is the core cause of misclassification in every sample above.",
        "Comprehensive analysis and confirmation that the preliminary summary already covers the sample-specific boundary features (detailed reasoning):\n\nTrend and baseline (early phase, t\u22480\u201345): The trace remains a stable negative offset around -0.65 with only very small slow fluctuations (\u00b10.02\u20130.05). In the STFT this corresponds to very-low-frequency / DC energy concentrated at the 0 Hz row but with low magnitude. The SHAP heatmap marks this early baseline predominantly with light-red at the 0 Hz / adjacent very-low-frequency rows \u2014 the model treats this baseline as typical supportive evidence for the pointing label. This is consistent with the preliminary summary and is not the cause of misclassification.\n\nOnset / rapid rise (onset phase, t\u224845\u201360): The signal shows a sharp upward slope beginning around time step ~45 and peaking by ~60, rising from roughly -0.65 to ~+1.9\u20132.1 (\u0394 \u2248 2.5\u20132.8 in this sample). The STFT shows a time-localized increase in energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins while remaining narrow-band (little high-frequency spread). The SHAP heatmap in this rise window is mixed: some low-frequency cells show red and some show neutral-to-slight-blue. This mixed coloring indicates model ambiguity for the rapid rise: when the rise is relatively steep and large its contribution becomes atypical for pointing (blue patches) whereas milder rises are seen as typical (red). In Sample 5 the rise is fairly steep and contributes some blue SHAP weight \u2014 this partially reduces support for label 1.\n\nSustained plateau / hold (mid phase, t\u224860\u201380): The signal remains at a high positive level about +2.05 for a prolonged window (~20 time steps). The STFT exhibits strong concentrated energy at the 0 Hz row (dominant DC/very-low-frequency energy) during this window. In the SHAP heatmap the same low-frequency cells during the plateau are predominantly blue, indicating that the model regards this sustained low-frequency elevation as atypical for pointing and more gun-like. This plateau is the primary atypical feature for label 1 in this sample and the main driver of the black-box model tipping toward class 0. The plateau's low-frequency dominance and long duration (hold) match precisely the misclassification cause described in the preliminary summary.\n\nDescent and crossing (t\u224880\u201395): The signal shows a moderate-to-sharp negative slope back through 0 and down to a negative trough. The STFT again concentrates energy at low frequencies during the descent. The SHAP marking here is mixed: low-frequency cells show small blue patches in the descent region but there are also light red cells just after the crossing. This mixed coloring indicates ambiguity: some aspects of the descent resemble the two-stroke gun-draw return (atypical for pointing), while other aspects remain consistent with pointing.\n\nNegative undershoot / return valley (t\u224895\u2013115): A short negative trough around -0.7 to -0.8 appears, then the trace returns slowly to ~-0.55. STFT energy is low-frequency; SHAP shows light-red at the low-frequency bins around the trough for this sample, indicating the model can view this undershoot as somewhat typical for pointing. Because the trough depth is moderate and smooth (no broad jitter), it does not strongly push classification toward gun.\n\nFrequency morphology and jitter (overall): Across the whole event the energy is narrow-band concentrated at DC/very-low-frequency rows; there is little high-frequency dispersion or jitter. The SHAP heatmap focuses on these very-low-frequency rows; absence of high-frequency supportive features means the model relies heavily on low-frequency patterns, allowing the plateau's atypical low-frequency signature to dominate.\n\nLogits and model decision: The predicted label is 0 (gun) with logits [-0.0207, -0.1238], indicating only a mild margin favoring class 0. The SHAP heatmap shows that the plateau low-frequency cells are the strongest blue (atypical for pointing) contributors; combined with mixed/ambiguous coloring in the rise and descent, the plateau's atypical signature is sufficient to flip the decision. This matches the preliminary summary assertions: the long sustained high plateau (low-frequency DC energy) + the rise-hold-return morphology are the classification-boundary drivers.\n\nConclusion on omissions: All features that cause this sample to be a boundary / misclassified example (stable negative baseline, steep rise, long sustained high plateau dominated by 0 Hz energy, ambiguous descent, moderate undershoot, absence of high-frequency jitter) are already enumerated in the provided preliminary feature summary. No additional misclassification-causing features or patterns are missing for Sample 5. The preliminary summary correctly identifies the plateau low-frequency signature and rise\u2013hold\u2013return morphology as the decisive boundary features."
