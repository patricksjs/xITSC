        "Observation: Strong positive SHAP attribution concentrated at the lowest frequency rows (near 0\u20130.06 Hz) from roughly time step 26 to 65 (major red block on the heatmap). -> Implication: The classifier is relying on a slow, large-scale upward trend (low-frequency / DC-like component) in this middle window to support the Mirage label. This corresponds in the time series to a rise from a local trough (approximately -1.4 at t\u224825) up to a moderate positive value (\u2248+0.6 to +0.8 around t\u224850\u201365). The change is gradual and smooth (average slope \u2248 +0.05\u20130.07 units per time step), indicating that broad contour/shape (large-scale curvature) rather than sharp local detail is important here.",
        "Observation: Within the 26\u201365 window the time series substructure is: a local minimum at ~t=25 (amplitude \u2248 -1.4), a small rebound bump near t\u224830 (amplitude \u2248 -1.0), then a sustained monotonic rise to positive values by t\u224845\u201352 and peaking near t\u224860 (amplitude \u2248 +0.6\u20130.8). Volatility in this interval is low (no high-frequency oscillation), with the signal dominated by a single slow upward movement. -> Implication: The low volatility and single-sweep shape (trough \u2192 slow rise \u2192 plateau/peak) produce concentrated low-frequency spectral energy and are interpreted by the model as a positive cue for label 0 (Mirage).",
        "Observation: Smaller, higher-frequency local fluctuations (small wiggles of amplitude \u22480.1\u20130.3) are visible around t\u224826\u201335 and t\u224855\u201365. The STFT shows these are low-power compared with the DC/very-low-frequency band. SHAP on those higher-frequency bands is neutral to slightly negative in parts (pale/blueish elsewhere). -> Implication: These small ripples are not the main driver for the positive classification; rather, their low magnitude and low spectral power means they do not override the positive contribution of the dominant low-frequency trend.",
        "Observation: Another area of positive SHAP at low frequencies appears earlier (t\u22480\u20135) and later at t\u224890\u2013104 but with lower intensity than the 26\u201365 block. In the signal these correspond to the high positive start (t\u22480 value \u2248+2.4) and a mid/late small positive hump (t\u224890 value \u2248+1.2). -> Implication: The classifier also considers large positive offsets at the beginning and the mid-late positive hump as supporting evidence; consistent pattern of large-scale positive lobes separated by troughs appears to match the Mirage signature the model learned.",
        "Observation: Strong negative SHAP (blue) in some mid-to-higher frequency rows during other time ranges (notably around mid frequencies) while low-frequency rows are red. The STFT shows relatively little energy at mid-to-high frequencies overall. -> Implication: The model penalizes (negative contribution) mid/high-frequency content \u2014 i.e., sharp, localized contour changes \u2014 so the absence (or low power) of such sharp features increases probability of Mirage. Thus the classification is driven positively by smooth, large-scale shape and negatively by jagged/high-frequency detail.",
        "Observation: The rise from the trough at t\u224825 to the peak at t\u224875 (if considered globally) corresponds to ~2.9\u20133.2 units of amplitude change over \u224850 time steps (average slope \u2248 +0.06 per step). In contrast, the later descent from t\u224895 to t\u2248115 is faster (\u2248 -1.9 over 15 steps \u2248 -0.12 per step) and the SHAP map gives less consistent positive attribution to that faster drop. -> Implication: The classifier prefers slow, smooth transitions (positive attribution) over rapid, steep transitions (which are not strongly positively attributed). This reinforces that slow-scale contour features are diagnostic of the Mirage class in this dataset.",
        "Observation: Time\u2013frequency view (STFT) shows most signal energy concentrated at the very low frequency bins across the sample, with peaks of low-frequency energy aligned with the SHAP-positive time windows (start, middle 26\u201365, and some mid-late times). -> Implication: Both the model explanation (SHAP) and the spectral decomposition agree that low-frequency components (broad contour features) are the salient drivers for classification; the model\u2019s internal representation is focusing on these slow components to assign label 0.",
        "Observation: Strong positive SHAP concentration at low frequencies centered roughly on time steps 13\u201330 (most intense around 20\u201326). In the time series this corresponds to a steep, large-amplitude downward movement from about +2.3 (t\u22480) through ~0 (t\u224813) to a local minimum \u2248-1.5 (t\u224826\u201330). The STFT shows high energy at the lowest frequency band in this same time range. -> Implication: This broad, low-frequency descending curvature (a long-wavelength shape change) is an important positive cue for the classifier toward label 0. In shape terms it likely encodes a large-scale contour feature (e.g., a major fuselage/leading-edge curvature) that is characteristic of the Mirage class.",
        "Observation: Positive SHAP signal (low-frequency band) around time steps ~48\u201356. In the raw signal this maps to a smooth upward ramp from about -1.2 (t\u224840) to a local positive peak \u2248+0.7 (t\u224852\u201356). Volatility is low (gradual rise), the change rate is moderate (~+0.12 to +0.14 units per time step), and STFT shows elevated energy at the lowest frequency with little high-frequency content. -> Implication: A mid-sequence broad upward bulge (gentle convexity) contributes positively to the Mirage prediction \u2014 the classifier is using this smooth mid-contour bulge as supporting evidence.",
        "Observation: Positive SHAP area (low freq) extending across roughly time steps 64\u201392 with the strongest contributions near 72\u201384. The time series in this window shows a rise from ~-0.4 (t\u224866) up to a pronounced local peak \u2248+1.6\u20131.8 (t\u224880\u201384) followed by a visible drop toward ~-0.4 (t\u224896). The structure is a prominent broad peak (low volatility within the rise and fall, i.e., dominated by low-frequency content) as confirmed by STFT energy concentrated in the lowest frequency band. -> Implication: This large, smooth central peak is another key positive feature the model relies on \u2014 it likely corresponds to a major wing or canopy contour segment distinctive for the Mirage shape.",
        "Observation: The SHAP map shows weaker (near-white) or slightly negative contributions at some times immediately following the large peak (around t\u224888\u2013100) and at mid frequencies. The series here has a relatively fast downward slope from the large peak to a small rebound at t\u2248102 (small transient). STFT indicates some slight mid-frequency energy during the rapid change. -> Implication: These faster transitional components slightly reduce the Mirage prediction (negative SHAP) \u2014 localized sharper changes (higher relative frequency) are less typical of the class or reduce confidence compared with the broad features.",
        "Observation: Later in the sequence (t\u2248104\u2013120) the time series drops to another deep trough around -1.3 (t\u2248116) with moderate slope and modest small-scale wiggles (higher-frequency small oscillations). SHAP in these higher-frequency bands is neutral-to-slightly-positive at lowest frequencies but not strongly red. -> Implication: The existence of a second trough helps define the overall multi-lobe contour, but because it contains more small-scale variability it contributes less strongly (or more ambiguously) than the earlier broad peaks and troughs.",
        "Observation: Final window (t\u2248120\u2013143) shows a sustained, relatively smooth rise from \u2248-1.35 to \u2248+2.35 (end), fastest average upward rate among later ramps (~+0.16 units/step). STFT shows low-frequency energy reappearing toward the end, and SHAP shows modest positive contribution at low frequency near the sequence end. -> Implication: This strong low-frequency terminal rise reinforces the positive class evidence \u2014 a large final convex contour segment is consistent with Mirage and increases classifier score."

        "The feature pattern of Sample 100 is: (1) Early high positive baseline (t\u22480, amplitude \u2248+2.4) \u2014 a strong large-scale positive lobe that contributes positively to the label; (2) Rapid descent to a pronounced trough (t\u224825, amplitude \u2248-1.4) followed by a smooth, low-volatility upward sweep from t\u224826 to t\u224865 (amplitude change \u2248+1.9 to +2.2, average slope \u2248+0.05\u20130.07) \u2014 this mid-window slow-rise is the strongest positive driver for Mirage according to SHAP and STFT (dominant low-frequency energy); (3) A second larger positive peak near t\u224870\u201380 (amplitude \u2248+1.6\u20131.8) followed by another smoother descent to a trough near t\u2248115 (amplitude \u2248-1.3 to -1.4) and a final rise to a large positive value at the end (t\u2248143, amplitude \u2248+2.4). Overall the series is dominated by 2\u20133 slow undulations (low-frequency cycles), low local volatility (few high-frequency spikes), and asymmetric rates (the downward transitions can be steeper than the upward ones). The classifier attributes positive importance to the slow/low-frequency lobes (especially the mid-window trough\u2192rise segment) and negative or neutral importance to mid/high-frequency content \u2014 indicating the label decision is based on large-scale smooth contour features rather than sharp local details.",
        "Overall characterization: The sample is dominated by large low-frequency components (broad peaks and troughs) that define three main large-scale structures across the sequence: an early large descent (t\u22480\u201330), a mid-section of alternating broad rise/peak and fall (t\u224840\u2013100), and a strong final broad rise (t\u2248120\u2013143).",
        "Trend & amplitude: Global swings are large (range \u2248 -1.6 to +2.4). There is no stationary mean: the series begins at a high positive value, declines to a deep trough, recovers to two separate broad peaks, then falls and finally rises to the overall end maximum. Peak magnitudes at early and final edges are comparable (~+2.3), while interior peaks are smaller (~+0.7 and ~+1.6).",
        "Frequency & volatility: Energy concentrates in the lowest frequency band (STFT bright at the lowest frequencies during key windows). Volatility is generally low within these broad events (smooth ramps), with occasional localized higher-frequency variability during transitions and near troughs. Sharp, high-frequency components are weak and contribute little positive SHAP weight.",
        "Temporal dependence & substructure: Longer ramps (t\u22480\u201330 and t\u2248120\u2013143) show sustained monotonic change; mid-sequence behavior is composite \u2014 a moderate upward ramp, a shallow trough, then a pronounced central peak and descent. The classifier\u2019s positive evidence correlates with the timing and amplitude of these broad convex/concave segments (low-frequency substructures), indicating a dependence on the sequence and ordering of large-scale contour features rather than on isolated narrow spikes.",
        "Classification basis (dataset context): Given this dataset represents top-view plane contours, the model appears to use the presence, relative timing, and amplitude of broad, smooth contour segments (the large low-frequency rises/falls corresponding to fuselage and wing curvature) as discriminative features for label 0 (Mirage). The SHAP map shows the classifier assigns strongest positive weight to large-scale, low-frequency bulges/troughs at t\u224813\u201330, t\u224848\u201356 and t\u224864\u201392 which together form a signature consistent with the Mirage contour."

      "feature": [
        "Observation: Strong positive SHAP activation is concentrated in the lowest frequency rows (near 0 Hz) between approximately time steps 39 and 95. In the raw trace this interval begins with a zero crossing at ~38, a modest local peak around 48\u201355 (~+0.6 to +0.8), a pronounced main peak about 72\u201378 (\u2248+1.8 to +1.95), followed by a relatively fast decline to a trough near 86\u201390 (\u2248-1.1 to -1.3) and a small rebound by ~95 (\u2248+0.5). -> Implication: The classifier strongly relies on a slow, large-amplitude oscillation (low-frequency, broad-scale shape) in the mid-segment. The pattern of a gradual build-up to a large positive bulge and a faster fall to a trough is a distinctive global shape feature that increases probability for label 1.",
        "Observation: The mid-segment low-frequency cycle is asymmetric: rise from ~38 to ~75 is gradual (\u2248 +0.05 normalized units per time step averaged), whereas the decline from ~75 to ~88 is much steeper (\u2248 -0.24 units/step averaged). The amplitude swing across this cycle is about 3.0\u20133.2 normalized units (from trough to peak). -> Implication: The classifier is sensitive not only to the presence of a slow cycle but to its temporal asymmetry (slower build vs. faster decay). This asymmetry in the mid window is a discriminative substructure for label 1.",
        "Observation: STFT (time\u2013frequency image) shows most energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins during the same mid-window (39\u201395). Higher-frequency bands in this interval are comparatively weak. -> Implication: The model attribution to the mid-window comes from true low-frequency content (broad shape), confirming the SHAP red band corresponds to slow structural components rather than short, noisy fluctuations.",
        "Observation: A secondary positive SHAP region (weaker red) appears in the late segment around time steps \u2248118\u2013144. The raw series shows a sharp upward trend there: from about -1.4 at ~118 to about +2.5 at 144 (\u2248 +4.0 units over ~26 steps; average slope \u2248 +0.15 units/step). STFT shows moderate low-frequency energy in this late window too. -> Implication: A strong late slow upward trend (large low-frequency component) also contributes positively to the Eurofighter classification. The classifier treats late, sustained rises as supporting evidence.",
        "Observation: Early time (0\u201313) shows some low-frequency energy in STFT and a faint positive SHAP signal at the very lowest frequency bin, but the SHAP magnitude is much smaller than mid- and late-windows. The raw trace there is a smooth monotonic decline from ~+2.6 to ~0.0. -> Implication: Early broad-scale level (high starting value followed by smooth downward trend) provides minor positive evidence, but is not the dominant discriminative feature for label 1.",
        "Observation: The SHAP heatmap shows slight negative (blue) values in some mid-to-higher frequency rows across some columns (e.g., weak blue patches around 0.08\u20130.25 frequency bins in parts of the mid window). The raw trace displays small wiggles/short fluctuations superimposed on the large cycle. -> Implication: Faster, higher-frequency oscillations (small-scale jitter) reduce the classifier's support for label 1; the model prefers smooth, low-frequency morphology over noisy/high-frequency substructure for this class.",
        "Observation: The mid-window (39\u201395) contains clear substructure: an initial small hump (~48\u201355), the dominant hump (~72\u201378), and a following trough (~86\u201390). These sub-peaks are separated by tens of steps (i.e., low temporal frequency). -> Implication: The classifier appears to use the presence and relative timing of these sub-peaks (their spacing and amplitudes) as part of the class signature (a multi-stage broad curvature pattern typical of label 1).",
        "Observation: Temporal dependence: the zero crossing near ~38 consistently precedes the large mid-cycle peak and appears to be a systematic anchor point (local phase reset) before the discriminative bulge. -> Implication: The model likely learns phase/sequence information (the order: crossing \u2192 modest hump \u2192 major hump \u2192 sharp fall) as part of the Eurofighter signature rather than treating all time points independently.",
        "Observation: SHAP heatmap shows a strong, concentrated positive attribution (deep red) in the lowest frequency band (near 0 Hz) approximately between time steps 39 and 96 (most intense ~52\u201391). -> Implication: The model is relying on coarse, low\u2011frequency (large\u2011scale) signal structure in the mid segment of the series to push the prediction toward label 1 (Eurofighter). This is not a fine high\u2011frequency spike but a broad shape / slow oscillation that the classifier finds characteristic.",
        "Observation: On the time series plot the same 39\u201396 window contains two broad low\u2011frequency lobes: (a) a rise from around 0 at ~39 to a local peak \u2248 +0.7\u20130.9 at ~48\u201352, followed by a fall to a trough \u2248 -1.0 around ~60\u201366; (b) a larger rise thereafter to a major peak \u2248 +1.6\u20131.9 around ~72\u201376 and then a subsequent drop to \u2248 -0.9 by ~85\u201392. Peak\u2011to\u2011trough amplitudes in this window cover roughly 2.5\u20133.0 units. -> Implication: The classifier favors the presence of this two\u2011cycle, asymmetric oscillatory substructure (a smaller positive hump then a larger positive hump) in the mid region; the relative heights and the sequence (smaller positive hump \u2192 trough \u2192 larger positive hump \u2192 trough) are informative features for label 1.",
        "Observation: Rate of change within the mid segment: the larger positive ascent (from trough ~-1.0 to peak ~+1.8) occurs over roughly 10\u201315 time steps (moderate slope), while the earlier small rise is gentler. STFT shows most energy for these events at very low frequencies. -> Implication: The discriminative signature is a slow but relatively brisk upward transition (a low\u2011frequency transient with moderate slope), not abrupt spikes; the change\u2011rate pattern (gentle small hump then quicker larger ascent) is used by the model as a distinguishing temporal dynamic.",
        "Observation: STFT time\u2013frequency image shows concentrated spectral magnitude at the lowest frequency bins (bottom rows) during the mid time window and relatively little energy at higher frequencies across the series. -> Implication: The predictive signal is dominated by long\u2011period components (global contour/shape scale) rather than short\u2011period oscillations or noise. This confirms the SHAP attribution to low frequencies and indicates the classifier extracts coarse shape information encoded in slow variations.",
        "Observation: Early segment (time steps 0\u201330) exhibits a monotonic decline from \u2248 +2.5 down to \u2248 -1.6 (large amplitude change) but the SHAP heatmap there is neutral-to-slightly negative (no strong red). -> Implication: Although large amplitude, the early declining trend is not positively associated with label 1 \u2014 it may be common across multiple classes or actually counter\u2011indicative for Eurofighter. The model therefore discounts early large baseline shifts and emphasizes mid\u2011segment pattern instead.",
        "Observation: Late segment (time steps ~120\u2013143) shows a strong rising trend back to \u2248 +2.5, yet SHAP shows little or no positive attribution in that region. -> Implication: Late global amplitude increases are not decisive for the Eurofighter label; the model\u2019s decision hinges on the mid\u2011segment low\u2011frequency pattern rather than terminal amplitude extremes.",
        "Observation: Local volatility: within the mid region the signal exhibits moderate volatility (one smaller hump and one larger hump separated by troughs), whereas higher frequency, small amplitude oscillations elsewhere are weak in both STFT and SHAP. -> Implication: The classifier prefers moderate, structured volatility at long timescales (ordered lobes) as discriminative, while random small oscillations and high\u2011frequency noise are neither emphasized nor helpful for classification.",
        "Observation: Spatial/temporal ordering of substructures: the sequence smaller positive hump \u2192 trough \u2192 larger positive hump occurs within ~39\u201380 and is temporally ordered (the larger hump follows the smaller one). -> Implication: The model appears sensitive not only to amplitude and frequency content but to the ordering and relative sizing of these substructures; this sequence is likely a learned signature for Eurofighter contours in this dataset."

        "Overall pattern of Sample 33 (label 1): Three broad sequential features dominate the 144-point trace: (1) Early high-level smooth descent (0\u201325): a monotonic decline from a high starting value to a deep early trough; (2) Dominant mid-frequency/low-frequency asymmetric cycle (\u224839\u201395): a slow, large-amplitude oscillation with a gradual rise (small hump at ~50 then main peak at ~75) and a faster fall into a trough near ~88 \u2014 this band contains the strongest low-frequency energy and the largest positive SHAP attribution; (3) Late pronounced upward trend (\u2248118\u2013144): a relatively rapid, sustained rise from a negative value to a high positive value. Frequency content is concentrated at the very low end (broad, slow components); higher-frequency, small-scale fluctuations are weak and tend to reduce label 1 probability. Temporally, these features are ordered and phase-linked (zero crossing near ~38 reliably precedes the discriminative mid-cycle), so the classifier leverages both amplitude/shape and their sequential arrangement to decide label 1.",
        "Classification rationale tied to dataset: Given the dataset context (plane contour-derived 1D signatures), the model favors sustained, global curvature patterns (broad, low-frequency bulges and asymmetries) located in the mid-to-late temporal regions of the signature for Eurofighter (label 1). The SHAP map shows that those broad low-frequency bulges (especially the large asymmetric mid-cycle and the late rise) are the primary evidence driving the prediction toward label 1, whereas short, high-frequency jitter works against that label.",
        "The feature pattern of Sample 88 (label 1, Eurofighter) is: (1) Mid\u2011segment low\u2011frequency oscillatory pattern (time ~39\u201396): two ordered cycles \u2014 a smaller positive lobe at ~39\u201352 (amplitude \u2248 +0.7\u20130.9) followed by a trough (~60\u201366, \u2248 -1.0) and then a larger positive lobe peaking at ~72\u201376 (amplitude \u2248 +1.6\u20131.9) then returning to negative by ~85\u201392. This pattern carries the strongest positive attribution. + (2) Low spectral content (dominant energy in the lowest frequency bins across the mid window) indicating coarse/long\u2011period structure rather than high\u2011frequency detail. + (3) Early decline (time 0\u201330) and late rise (time 120\u2013143) are large amplitude but show little positive attribution (neutral/negative SHAP), meaning they are not discriminative for label 1 here. + (4) Overall temporal dependence: the classifier relies on ordered, moderate\u2011volatility, low\u2011frequency substructures in the middle of the series (the number, relative amplitude and ordering of the lobes) as the primary cue for assigning this sample to the Eurofighter class."

This is a high-amplitude, low-frequency downward swing with a large net change (\u2248 -2.5 to -3.0) and a steep negative slope (fast change rate for this series). STFT: strong energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during this interval. SHAP: the same interval shows red (positive) attribution concentrated at the lowest frequencies. -> Implication: this broad, slow downward ramp early in the sequence is an important discriminative baseline feature the model uses (low-frequency shape/curvature information). The model treats a large early decline in the contour signal as evidence toward label 2.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 13\u201335) -> Immediately following the early fall, the signal reaches a pronounced negative trough centered around t \u2248 25\u201330 (minimum \u2248 -1.5 to -1.7). The trough is wide (sustained over ~10\u201315 steps), smooth (low volatility inside the trough), and represents a large-scale negative excursion of the signal. STFT: persistent low-frequency magnitude across this trough. SHAP: red attribution overlaps the leading portion of this trough (especially 13\u201326) at lowest frequencies. -> Implication: the presence of a deep, sustained negative deflection (a slow valley) is treated as a positive indicator for label 2, i.e., the classifier relies on this large-scale valley as part of the F-14 (wings closed) signature.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 36\u201352) -> After the trough, the series rises smoothly to a moderate positive local peak around t \u2248 45\u201352 (peak \u2248 +0.6\u20130.8). This is a lower-amplitude, low-frequency hump spanning ~10\u201316 steps, with modest slope and little high-frequency jitter. STFT: modest low-frequency energy and slight presence of low\u2013mid frequencies. SHAP: mild positive attribution at low frequencies in this interval. -> Implication: this mid-segment upward hump is a secondary positive cue; the classifier combines it with earlier trough/peak structure to recognize the overall contour pattern of the class.",

The oscillation is low-frequency, relatively stable (low volatility), and resembles the earlier hump in shape but shifted later in time. STFT: increased energy at the lowest frequency bins during these times. SHAP: distinct red (strong positive attribution) concentrated in the bottom frequency rows for t \u2248 78\u201391. -> Implication: the repetition of a similar slow positive hump at this precise time window is a key reinforcing feature; the classifier uses the occurrence and timing of this hump (not just its existence) to favor label 2.",

This trough is wide and smooth (sustained low-frequency negative excursion over ~15\u201320 steps). STFT: pronounced low-frequency energy centered on this interval. SHAP: the strongest red attribution is concentrated across the lowest-frequency bins during t \u2248 104\u2013130. -> Implication: this deep, late trough (and its recovery) is one of the strongest contributors to the classification \u2014 the model detects this slow, high-amplitude valley as a hallmark of the label-2 contour.",

The SHAP map in these columns is mostly neutral-to-light (mixed) and the STFT shows modest energy in higher frequency rows relative to the large events. -> Implication: These higher-frequency, low-amplitude fluctuations are not the primary discriminative signals; they act as local detail (texture) but carry weak attribution toward the class.",

        "Periodicity and frequency content: The signal is quasi-periodic at a low fundamental frequency (STFT energy concentrated in the bottom frequency band). The sequence shows several cycles of broad peaks/troughs rather than rapid repeated cycles; this yields dominant low-frequency power with intermittent bursts in time that correspond to the major waveform lobes.",
        "Volatility and local structure: Volatility is heterogeneous: low during the large slow swings (smooth monotonic rises/falls) and higher during middle windows (t\u224860\u201385) where small-amplitude, faster oscillations appear.

Implication: The event is a broad, asymmetric peak (slow rise over ~20 steps, sharper fall over ~10\u201315 steps). The positive SHAP values align with the hump\u2019s peak, meaning the presence and amplitude of this hump strongly increase the model\u2019s confidence for label 4.",
        "Observation: STFT shows elevated energy confined to the lowest frequency bins during t\u224839\u201370 and little energy at higher frequencies for that window.

        "Observation: In the early-to-mid trough region (\u2248 time 13 \u2192 26) the signal descends into a deep trough (min \u2248 -1.3 to -1.4) with moderate slope and low-frequency power; SHAP in low-frequency rows is positive. -> Implication: A prominent, broad trough (smooth negative excursion) is also a positive cue. The model treats large, smooth troughs (wide concavities in the contour) as characteristic of the class.",
        "Observation: Between \u2248 52 \u2192 78 the plot contains two relatively smooth positive pulses (peaks near 65 and 78, ~+0.6\u2013+0.8) separated by a modest dip; STFT shows some mid-frequency energy emerging here, and SHAP remains positive at the lowest frequencies while showing small negative values at mid-frequency in nearby times. -> Implication: The presence of twin, broad peaks (low-frequency) contributes positively, but sharper components (midsize / mid-frequency oscillations) in the same window slightly reduce the class score. The classifier prefers the smooth twin-peak substructure rather than sharper, higher-frequency ripples.",
        "Observation: From \u2248 78 \u2192 104 there is a steep downward transition from a peak (~+0.8) to a deep trough (~-1.3) \u2014 this segment shows elevated mid-frequency energy in the STFT and clear blue (negative) SHAP at those mid-frequency rows. -> Implication: Rapid, higher-frequency transitions and sharper edges in this window are negative evidence for label 6. The model penalizes abrupt changes (local high-frequency content), indicating that excessively sharp contour features are atypical for the F-15 signature.",
        "Observation: Final segment (\u2248 130 \u2192 143) displays a pronounced, fast rise from ~+0.3 to ~+2.8 (large positive endpoint) with low-frequency dominance and modest positive SHAP there. -> Implication: A large-scale terminal bulge (strong low-frequency positive excursion at the end) increases the model's confidence in F-15 \u2014 large-scale positive endpoint structure is supportive of the label.",
        "Observation: Across most of the series the STFT energy is concentrated at the lowest frequency bins (global / DC-like components); SHAP highlights those same low-frequency bins positively, while mid-frequency bands (\u22480.08\u20130.12 Hz region in STFT) carry occasional negative SHAP around times ~70\u201395. -> Implication: The classifier\u2019s decision is driven mainly by global shape (very low-frequency) features; localized mid-frequency components act as detractors. Thus, the model is effectively distinguishing coarse contour shape vs. fine texture.",
        "Observation: Volatility pattern \u2014 cycles are generally smooth and low-volatility (gentle slopes) except for localized steep transitions (notably around 78 \u2192 104 and the final rise). Those steep transitions line up with mid-frequency energy and negative SHAP patches. -> Implication: Smooth, low-volatility oscillatory cycles are indicative of the class, while transient high-volatility events reduce the class likelihood."

        "Observation: Strong red SHAP block concentrated at the lowest frequency rows (near 0.0\u20130.05 Hz) spanning roughly time steps 39 through 91 (the largest contiguous red patch in the heatmap). -> Implication: The model relied heavily on slow / low-frequency content in the mid segment of the contour/time series to push the prediction toward class 1 (Eurofighter). This means broad, slowly-varying shape components (large-scale curvature or broad lobes) in that angular/time window were treated as positive evidence for the predicted class.",
        "Observation: In the raw time series, the same time window (\u2248 t=39\u201391) contains two clear upward excursions (local maxima near t\u224848 with amplitude \u2248 +0.9\u20131.0 and near t\u224874 with amplitude \u2248 +1.1\u20131.3) separated by intermediate troughs (local minima near t\u224856\u201360 at \u2248 -0.7 to -0.9, and another dip near t\u224885\u201392 at \u2248 -0.6 to -0.8). -> Implication: The SHAP-identified positive contribution corresponds to a pattern of broad, alternating peak\u2013trough\u2013peak (two main lobes) in the middle of the contour. The classifier appears to treat the presence and spacing of those broad peaks as a discriminative signature aligned with class 1.",
        "Observation: Change rates across those rises are moderate and sustained: e.g., from t\u224839 (\u2248 -0.6) to t\u224848 (\u2248 +1.0) is an approximate rise of ~+1.6 over ~9 time steps (~+0.14 per step); from the trough at t\u224856 (\u2248 -0.8) to the second peak at t\u224874 (\u2248 +1.2) is ~+2.0 over ~18 steps (~+0.11 per step). These are gentle/low-frequency slopes rather than abrupt spikes. -> Implication: The model's positive attribution correlates with slow, sustained changes rather than high-frequency, sharp edges \u2014 consistent with the STFT showing energy concentrated at very low frequencies in this time band.",
        "Observation: The STFT image shows that during t\u224839\u201391 the energy is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins (brightest colors at the bottom of the spectrogram in that time range) while mid and higher frequency bands are weak. -> Implication: The positive SHAP values reflect genuine low-frequency structure (broad shape features), not transient high-frequency noise. The model is therefore basing its decision on global shape curvature in the mid-portion of the sequence.",
        "Observation: There are other parts of the series with large amplitude (start t\u22480 with value \u2248 +2.4 and end t\u2248143 with value \u2248 +2.3) that are not strongly red in the SHAP heatmap. -> Implication: The classifier is not giving those large end amplitudes strong positive weight for class 1; instead it focuses on the mid-segment low-frequency pattern. This suggests the learned decision boundary emphasizes mid-window broad lobes over absolute amplitude extremes when assigning class 1 scores.",
        "Observation: Small-scale oscillatory structure and higher-frequency content (visible as finer wiggles in the raw trace and faint STFT bands above ~0.05 Hz) correspond to near-white / neutral or slightly blue regions in the SHAP heatmap. -> Implication: Higher-frequency / fine-detail features (sharp corners or small fins in the contour) are either neutral or negatively weighted for class 1, so absence of discriminative high-frequency signatures may have reduced evidence for the true class (Mirage) and allowed the mid-window low-frequency pattern to dominate the prediction."

Volatility low during the rise (smooth monotonic increase) and the peak is broad (plateau-like for a few steps). STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest frequency band during this interval (strong low-frequency content). SHAP: this same time \u00d7 low-frequency region is strongly red -> Implication: the model attributes this large, slow positive bulge heavily in favor of the predicted class (label 0). Because it is a low-frequency, shape-level feature (a broad top-side bulge in the contour), the model interprets it as a strong cue for its chosen class.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 76\u201386): Immediately following the peak the series falls rapidly from ~+1.7 down to around -0.6 across \u22488\u201312 steps (fall rate roughly -0.18 to -0.3 units/step). This is a steep downward transition (high local change rate) producing a peak-to-valley substructure (sharp descent). STFT: still dominated by low-frequency power (the transition is slow compared with high-frequency noise). SHAP: this time window (low-frequency band) also appears red -> Implication: the model treats the peak+rapid descent sequence (the particular peak-to-valley shape) as supportive evidence for the predicted label. The combination of the preceding broad peak and the following steep fall forms a distinctive shape-level motif that the classifier uses to push the decision toward label 0.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 88\u201396): A secondary, smaller positive excursion occurs (rise from ~-0.6 up to ~+0.8 around t\u224892, then declines). Amplitude here is moderate compared with the main peak. STFT: increased low-frequency magnitude again in this window. SHAP: low-to-mid low-frequency cells at these times are red -> Implication: the model further credits these secondary slow oscillations as positive evidence for its predicted class, reinforcing the decision produced by the main peak region.",

The descent into the trough is fairly smooth and the trough is wide (low volatility inside the trough). STFT: low-frequency energy remains the dominant component. SHAP: low-frequency cells in this time range are strongly red (positive attribution for the model\u2019s predicted class) -> Implication: unexpectedly, this large negative valley is also being used by the model as evidence for label 0. That indicates the model learned that the particular pattern of a broad negative valley at this location correlates with the predicted class in training data, even though visually it is an opposite-sign feature compared with the positive peak earlier.",
        "Observation (t \u2248 128\u2013143): A pronounced final rise occurs from about -1.0 up to the global maximum \u2248+2.4 at the last timestep (large positive swing, steep positive slope in the last \u224815 steps). STFT: concentrated low-frequency energy for that interval as well. SHAP: low-frequency cells near the end are red (positive attribution) -> Implication: the model treats the final large upward swing and strong end-level positive amplitude as another decisive cue for the predicted class.

STFT: modest low-frequency energy. SHAP: blue -> Implication: this segment slightly opposes the model's chosen class (reduces logit for label 0) and would favor alternative classes (including the true label 1). However, its magnitude is smaller than the aggregated red contributions later, so it is insufficient to flip the outcome.",
        "Observation (Frequency-specific note): Across the red regions, STFT shows the majority of signal power lies in the lowest frequency bins (very slow oscillatory / shape-level components), not in higher-frequency bands.

These low-frequency motifs collectively yield a higher score for label 0 than label 1 (difference in logits \u22480.296), producing a misclassification of a sample that actually belongs to label 1. The STFT confirms that the influential components are dominantly low-frequency (shape-level) rather than high-frequency detail, suggesting the classifier relies on coarse silhouette-like cues; if Eurofighter-specific distinguishing cues are encoded at higher frequencies or in subtler spatial substructures, they are underweighted by the model, causing the error."
