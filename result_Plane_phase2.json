Change rate: steep negative (~-0.12 to -0.2 units/step early). Volatility: low during the monotonic fall (no high-frequency oscillations). STFT: low-frequency energy present near the start but not strong mid/high bands. Shape: broad downward sweep (large-scale curvature).\\n- t=16\u201335: Deep, wide trough centered roughly t\u224818\u201328 with minimum near \u2248 -1.2 to -1.4. This trough is smooth and sustained (low volatility inside). Substructure: small shallow wiggles around trough (amplitude \u2248 0.1\u20130.3) but low spectral power. STFT: energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bin during this window.\\n- t=36\u201360: Slow, smooth recovery and a clear low-frequency positive hump centered ~t\u224848\u201355 (values rising from negative toward \u2248 +0.7\u2013+0.9). Change rate: moderate positive slope (gentle recovery). Volatility: low. STFT: increased power in lowest-frequency rows coincident with the hump.\\n- t=61\u201385: Another larger rise to a pronounced positive peak near t\u224870\u201376 (peak \u2248 +1.4\u2013+1.7), followed by a decline to near zero by ~t\u224885. Shape: broad asymmetric bulge (rise slower, fall somewhat quicker). STFT: lowest-frequency bins show strongest magnitudes in this interval; mid/high rows weak.\\n- t=86\u2013110: Fall into a moderate trough (values ~-0.4 to -1.3 around t\u2248100\u2013115). This descent has slightly faster slope than some previous rises; there are modest small ripples but overall dominated by low-frequency energy. STFT: low-frequency energy continues to dominate; small mid-frequency contributions appear during the descent but weak.\\n- t=111\u2013143: Final sustained, monotonic rise from the late trough to a strong end-level peak (~+2.3 to +2.5 at t=143). Change rate: relatively large positive slope in the terminal segment (~+0.12\u2013+0.18 units/step). Volatility: low (smooth ramp). STFT: low-frequency power reappears aligned with the final rise.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal dependencies:\\n- Dominant characteristics: The series is dominated by a few (2\u20133) broad, low-frequency lobes (large-scale peaks/troughs), low local volatility inside these lobes, and clear temporal ordering: initial high \u2192 deep trough \u2192 mid hump \u2192 larger central hump \u2192 late trough \u2192 strong terminal rise. The STFT confirms primary energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins across the key windows (start, mid, late) and little energy at mid/high frequencies. Sharp, high-frequency spikes are minimal and when present are low amplitude and low power.\\n- Periodicity and shape: Quasi-periodic slow undulations with roughly 30\u201350 time-step spacing between extrema. Asymmetry is evident (some rises are slower than subsequent falls and vice versa), which is a salient substructure feature.\\n- Combination/temporal dependence: The classifier would reasonably treat the mid-sequence broad bulge(s) and the final strong rise combined with the early trough as a composite signature \u2014 timing and ordering of these low-frequency lobes matter (not just isolated amplitude extremes).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and candidate selection:\\n- Comparison to label 0 (Mirage) summary: Strong match. Label 0 descriptions emphasize concentrated positive at very-low frequencies in mid windows (e.g., trough around t\u224825 then a sustained smooth rise around t\u224826\u201365, plus a later pronounced central peak and final broad rise). The test sample shows the same multi-lobe low-frequency pattern: early large descent into a trough (~t=18\u201328), smooth mid-to-late rises with a pronounced central peak (~t=70), and a large terminal rise. STFT pattern (lowest-frequency energy localized in the same time windows) and the low volatility inside broad events match the label-0 pattern closely. Visual similarity to the four provided 'similar' reference plots (Samples 83, 32, 55, 38) is high: the shapes, relative positions of troughs/peaks, amplitude ranges, and STFT low-frequency concentration are nearly the same.\\n- Comparison to other labels (brief): Labels 1,2,4,5,6 each emphasize low-frequency lobes too but with different timing/amplitude patterns; however the particular ordering and amplitude pattern (early high, early deep trough, mid hump, central strong peak, late trough, final strong rise) and the STFT localization align best with label 0. Labels 3 (F-14 wings opened) displays multiple separated deep negative lobes and some different timing and label-3 reference STFT show stronger mid-frequency bursts relative to the sample; dissimilar samples shown for label 3 have more intermediate high-frequency texture and different mid-sequence structure than the test sample. Overall the closest and most consistent match is label 0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and scoring:\\n- The four provided similar reference samples are all labeled 0 and visually nearly identical to the test sample: same early-high-to-deep-trough, mid-smooth hump(s) near t\u224848\u201376, and strong terminal rise. Their STFT panels also show bright lowest-frequency energy in the same windows as the test sample. This confirms both visual and spectral consistency with label 0.\\n- The two dissimilar references (label 3) have more mid-frequency activity and different arrangement of lobes; they are not good matches.\\n- Given the near one-to-one correspondence in waveform morphology, amplitude ranges, temporal ordering of key lobes, low-voltage interior of lobes, and STFT low-frequency concentration with the label-0 references and feature summary, I assign the highest similarity score (4 = high similarity) to label 0.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 0 (Mirage).

Change rate: large negative slope (fast drop). Volatility: low within the main drop (smooth). STFT: low-frequency energy present at the left edge. Manifestation: a broad, high-amplitude early positive lobe followed by a smooth downward ramp.\\n- t = 16\u201335: The trace reaches and stays in a pronounced trough (\u2248 -1.4 to -1.6) with small local wiggles (~\u00b10.1\u20130.3). Volatility: low inside trough, with a couple of small higher-frequency ripples. STFT: sustained energy in lowest frequency rows across this trough. Shape: wide, smooth valley lasting ~10\u201318 steps.\\n- t = 36\u201355: Smooth recovery and a moderate positive hump (peak ~+0.6 to +0.9 around t\u224848\u201352). Change rate: moderate positive slope during rise, low volatility. STFT: low-frequency energy concentrated at bottom rows aligned to the hump. Substructure: single broad convex bulge (no high-frequency spikes).\\n- t = 56\u201380: Continued rise into a stronger mid/late positive peak (largest mid-sequence peak around t\u224870\u201376, amplitude ~+1.4 to +1.8), then a descent. Change rate: gradual rise then faster descent. Volatility: low within rise/peak; slightly more mid-frequency energy during descent. STFT: clear strongest low-frequency band activation in this mid window.\\n- t = 81\u2013100: Fall from the mid peak to a modest trough around ~t=88\u201395 (values near -0.5 to -1.0) with a small rebound afterward. Volatility: somewhat higher during the descent (slightly more mid-frequency power), but still dominated by low-frequency content. STFT: lower band still dominant; small mid-frequency content appears transiently during the faster transitions.\\n- t = 101\u2013125: A deeper trough appears again (min near t\u2248110\u2013116, ~ -1.2 to -1.4) with a relatively smooth shape and then the start of recovery. Volatility: low-to-moderate; STFT: low-frequency energy centered on this late trough.\\n- t = 126\u2013143 (end): Rapid, smooth final rise from the late trough to a large positive endpoint (~+2.3 to +2.6 at t=143). Change rate: relatively fast positive slope compared with earlier rises. STFT: renewed low-frequency energy at the sequence end. Overall substructure: 2\u20133 large low-frequency lobes (trough\u2192slow rise\u2192peak), intermittent small ripples that are low-power relative to the broad waves.\\n\\nStep 1 \u2014 Frequency corroboration: The STFT image confirms most energy concentrated in the lowest frequency rows during the key windows (early drop, mid-window rise/peak, late trough and final rise). Higher-frequency rows show only weak, intermittent energy coincident with faster descents or small wiggles, matching the time-domain observation that large-scale smooth curvature dominates.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature analysis and temporal dependence:\\n- Global trend & periodicity: The sample is dominated by low-frequency, quasi-periodic large-scale undulations: an early large positive level and steep decline, a sustained deep trough, one or two mid-sequence broad rises/peaks, a late trough, and a strong terminal rise. This produces roughly 2\u20133 broad low-frequency cycles across 144 points.\\n- Volatility profile: Low volatility during broad peaks and troughs (smooth ramps). Slightly elevated volatility (and some mid-frequency energy) during relatively steeper transitions (notably the descent after the main mid peak and the recovery toward the end). Small high-frequency ripples are present but low amplitude and low spectral power.\\n- Combination and temporal dependence: The discriminative structure is the sequence and relative timing of large, smooth lobes (early bulge \u2192 deep trough \u2192 mid hump(s) \u2192 late trough \u2192 final bulge). The mid-sequence major hump (around t\u224865\u201376) and the final large rise are major anchors; smaller hump at ~48 and the broad early trough strengthen the multi-lobe signature. The ordering (trough then slow rise to a mid-peak then fall then final rise) is consistent across windows and forms a composite contour signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature summaries and selection of best label:\\n- Comparing the observed local and global features to the label summaries: The sample\u2019s pattern (early high start \u2192 steep early descent to deep trough at ~t=20\u201330 \u2192 smooth mid-window slow rise and a prominent mid-late peak near t\u224870 \u2192 another trough near t\u2248110 \u2192 strong final rise to high endpoint) aligns strongly with the detailed feature and pattern descriptions for label 0 (Mirage). The STFT evidence (dominant energy at the lowest frequency bins during those same windows) also matches the label_0 explanation emphasizing low-frequency bulges/troughs at comparable time regions (start, ~13\u201330, ~48\u201376, ~64\u201392, and final rise).\\n- Other labels: Many other label summaries emphasize different mid-window timing, asymmetries, or penalize mid/high-frequency content differently. In particular label 3 (F-14 wings opened) shows some similar low-frequency lobes but its reference examples contain more pronounced separated negative lobes of different timing and slightly different slopes; provided dissimilar samples labeled 3 show more mixed mid-frequency activity in middle windows. Labels 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 each have their own characteristic timing/amplitude patterns which do not match the observed sample as closely as label 0.\\n- Choice and similarity quantification: The best match is label 0 (Mirage). Given the strong alignment in timing of major lobes, amplitude ranges, low-frequency dominance in STFT, low volatility within lobes, and the close visual similarity to the four provided reference samples (all labeled 0), I assign a high similarity score of 4 (high similarity) to label 0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and sanity-check scoring logic:\\n- The four similar reference samples (Samples 83, 32, 55, 38) are visually extremely close: identical early high-start then steep drop into a deep trough near t\u224820\u201330, then a mid hump near 45\u201352, a major mid-late peak near ~70, a later trough ~110\u2013120, and a final strong rise to the end. Their STFT images show the same low-frequency concentration in the same time windows as the test sample. This confirms strong within-class consistency and supports the score 4.\\n- The two dissimilar samples (Samples 67 and 17, label 3) show more pronounced oscillatory detail in the mid-region (more mid-frequency patches in STFT and different relative amplitudes/timings), differing from the test sample\u2019s precise arrangement of low-frequency lobes. That contrast further supports selecting label 0 for the test sample.\\n- Fairness and consistency: The scoring uses the supplied similarity rubric \u2014 the test sample matches a reference pattern from the label_0 summary almost exactly (both in time-domain morphology and low-frequency spectro-temporal patterns). No other label offers such a close match. Therefore awarding the highest similarity score (4) for label 0 is consistent and justified.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 (Mirage) with similarity score 4 \u2014 the test sample's multi-lobe low-frequency contour, timing of troughs/peaks, low within-lobe volatility, and STFT low-frequency concentration match the label_0 pattern and the provided label-0 reference samples closely.\"\n  ]\n}",

Higher-frequency rows show little consistent power and only small transient mid-frequency energy around the steeper transitions; those higher-frequency components are minor compared to the dominant DC/very-low-frequency bands.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature analysis (global):\\n- Trend & periodicity: The sample is dominated by several large-scale low-frequency undulations: an early high \u2192 trough \u2192 mid hump \u2192 main peak \u2192 trough \u2192 deep late trough \u2192 final rise. This corresponds to ~2\u20133 slow cycles across 144 points. There is no stationary mean \u2014 the series has strong long-wavelength structure.\\n- Volatility: Low within the broad lobes (smooth ramps), with somewhat higher instantaneous slopes during the steeper descents/rises (notably early descent and final rise). Small high-frequency wiggles are present only locally and are low amplitude; STFT confirms they carry little energy.\\n- Temporal dependencies & shape: The discriminative information appears in the timing, amplitude, and asymmetry of broad convex/concave segments: an early broad descent to trough, a mid slow hump and a pronounced central peak, followed by a deep late trough and a final strong rise. The ordering (early high \u2192 trough \u2192 mid-rise \u2192 main peak \u2192 trough \u2192 final rise) is consistent and phase-coherent.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to the label feature lists (label-by-label comparison and similarity reasoning):\\n- Label 0 (Mirage): The label_0 summary describes (and the reference samples show) an early high positive value, a descent to a pronounced trough around t\u224825, a smooth slow rise in the middle window (t\u224826\u201365) and a pronounced central peak around t\u224870\u201385, followed by another trough and a final strong rise to a high endpoint. The test sample matches these elements very closely: early large positive start, trough near ~25\u201330, mid slow hump, main central peak near 70\u201376, late trough ~100\u2013116, and large final rise. STFT agreement: dominant energy at the lowest frequency rows aligned with these same windows. Conclusion: very high match.\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): Label_1 emphasizes a dominant asymmetric mid-segment low-frequency oscillation where a smaller hump (~t50) is followed by a larger hump (~t72) and a steep fall. Our sample does show a smaller mid hump and larger main peak with a relatively faster descent afterward \u2014 this feature overlaps with label_1 description. However label_1 descriptions emphasize that the mid-segment asymmetry is the decisive cue and that the early high decline and late rise are less relevant. In our sample the combination of early high, trough at ~25 and the final strong endpoint rise are important and align more tightly with label_0's composite multi-lobe signature than label_1's primarily mid-focused signature. Similarity: moderate.\\n- Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): Label_2 also contains multiple low-frequency humps/troughs at early, mid, and late times, but its characteristic pattern emphasizes an early steep fall and two or three large troughs in specific time windows (e.g., pronounced troughs at ~13\u201326 and ~104\u2013120) with a particular ordering. Our sample does show troughs in corresponding ranges but the mid-to-late hump/central peak morphology and the early trough-to-mid-rise signature are more strongly matching label_0. Similarity: moderate-to-low.\\n- Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): Label_3 and the provided dissimilar samples are characterized by somewhat different arrangements (e.g., earlier deep troughs and mid-sequence higher-frequency variability and more negative mid troughs). The provided dissimilar examples (labels 102, 46) show stronger multi-peaked mid-high-frequency jitter between ~50\u201395 and deeper negative extremes at different positions than sample 22. Our sample lacks the distinctive high-frequency mid texture and specific trough placements that define label_3. Similarity: low.\\n- Label 4,5,6 (Harrier, F-22, F-15): These labels show other distinguishing signatures (e.g., label_4: single dominant mid bump of very large amplitude; label_5: primary hump around 36\u201370 but with smaller endpoint emphasis; label_6: persistent low-frequency envelope with penalized mid-frequency spikes). While sample 22 shares the general property of low-frequency lobes with these classes (labels 4/5/6), the exact ordering, amplitudes and especially the triple-lobe structure (early descent to trough ~25, mid slow hump then larger central peak then late deep trough followed by strong endpoint rise) match the label_0 description more closely than any of these. Similarities to 4/5/6 are therefore low-to-moderate.\\n\\nQuantified similarity summary (1\u20134 scale) when comparing the sample to each label's prototypical pattern and the provided reference examples:\\n- Label 0 (Mirage): 4 (high similarity). Rationale: near one-to-one correspondence of early high \u2192 trough at ~25 \u2192 mid slow rise \u2192 central peak near 70\u201376 \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise; STFT low-frequency alignments also match label_0 description and the four reference samples labeled 0 are visually near-identical to sample 22.\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): 3 (moderate). Rationale: shares mid-segment asymmetric two-hump motif but lacks the exclusive mid-window emphasis of label_1 and the late/early features align better with label_0.\\n- Label 2 (F-14 closed): 2 (low). Rationale: some troughs in similar windows but overall ordering and amplitude relationships better match label_0.\\n- Label 3 (F-14 opened): 1 (no similarity). Rationale: dissimilar reference samples show different mid-sequence texture and trough placements; sample 22 lacks those distinguishing high-frequency mid textures and deeper negative extremes at the positions characteristic of label_3.\\n- Label 4 (Harrier): 2 (low). Rationale: Harrier emphasizes a single dominant mid bump; sample 22 has a composite multi-lobe structure rather than a single isolated dominant mid hump.\\n- Label 5 (F-22): 2 (low). Rationale: F-22 shows a dominant hump around t~=36\u201370 but typically smaller endpoint and different ordering; sample 22's full multi-lobe pattern and endpoint behavior align better with label_0.\\n- Label 6 (F-15): 2 (low). Rationale: F-15 captures persistent low-frequency envelope but penalizes certain mid-frequency transients seen in sample 22; the precise multi-lobe ordering is not the best match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four supplied 'similar' reference samples (Samples 16, 100, 83, 55) are all labeled 0 and their time-series and STFT plots are visually near-identical to sample 22 (same early high, trough ~25, mid hump, main peak ~70\u201376, troughs around 100\u2013116 and final rise). This independent verification strengthens the decision for label 0 and supports a high similarity score.\\n- The two supplied 'dissimilar' references (Samples 102, 46 labeled 3) diverge visually: they show more mid-segment higher-frequency ripples and different trough/peak placements. These contrasts reaffirm that sample 22 is not label 3.\\n- Consistency check: the sample's most diagnostic components (timing, amplitude and low-frequency concentration of the early trough, mid slow rise, central peak, late trough and final rise) precisely match the label_0 feature summary. STFT corroborates that the classifier would emphasize lowest-frequency rows in the corresponding time windows (as described in label_0 summary). Therefore the labeling decision is robust.\\n\\nFinal conclusion: assign label 0 (Mirage) with high confidence. The supplied similarity score for the chosen label (label 0) is 4 (high similarity) because the sample's multi-lobe, low-frequency temporal pattern and STFT alignment match the label_0 descriptions and provided reference examples almost exactly.\"\n  ]\n}",

Change rate is steep (large negative slope), volatility is low (no rapid jitter). STFT: low-frequency energy present at the left edge. This matches an early large positive baseline followed by a slow downward curvature.\\n- t = 16\u201335: The trace continues into a deep, broad trough centered ~t=22\u201328 with minimum near -1.4 to -1.6. The trough is wide (~10\u201315 steps), smooth (low local volatility). STFT: continued concentration in the very lowest frequency bin during this trough. This is a slow, long-wavelength negative lobe.\\n- t = 36\u201355: A smooth recovery and a moderate positive hump occur (rise from trough to ~+0.6\u2013+0.8 around t~48). Rise is gradual (low volatility) and the hump width is ~10\u201315 steps. STFT: strongest energy stays in the bottom frequency rows here, indicating low-frequency content.\\n- t = 56\u201380: The signal rises further into a larger mid-late peak around t~68\u201374 with amplitude ~+1.5\u2013+1.8, then descends toward a small negative region by ~t=84\u201390. The ascent into the larger peak is relatively smooth (moderate slope), the subsequent descent is somewhat faster. STFT: again shows lowest-frequency dominance for this window.\\n- t = 81\u2013110: After the large mid peak there is a descent into another trough around t~100\u2013115 (amplitude ~-1.2 to -1.4). Local volatility remains low in these broad segments; a few small higher-frequency wiggles appear but with low magnitude. STFT: low-frequency band remains the dominant contributor; mid-frequency energy is small.\\n- t = 111\u2013143 (end): From ~t=125 onward the series rises steadily and relatively quickly from about -0.6 to a final large positive endpoint (~+2.3 to +2.5 at t=143). This end-segment rise is pronounced, low-volatility within the ramp, and again low-frequency in STFT.\\nOverall local observations: the sample is composed of 2\u20133 major slow undulations (early descent into trough, mid recovery + large peak, later trough and strong final rise). High-frequency content is minimal and STFT confirms concentration of energy in the lowest frequency bins during the major events.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features, temporal dependencies and combination relationships:\\n- Trend & periodicity: The series is quasi-periodic at a low fundamental frequency: broad lobes spaced roughly 30\u201340 time steps apart (early trough, mid hump/peak, late trough, final large rise). There is no stationary mean \u2014 the sequence shows large slow swings and an overall multi-lobed envelope.\\n- Volatility: Volatility is low inside large ramps and lobes; brief small-amplitude oscillations appear between major events but do not dominate the energy. The STFT heatmap consistently shows highest magnitude in the lowest-frequency rows aligned with the main time windows (start, mid, late, end), confirming the dominant role of low-frequency, large-scale contour components.\\n- Temporal dependence: The ordering matters \u2014 an early high baseline \u2192 deep trough \u2192 sustained smooth rise to mid peak \u2192 descent \u2192 final recovery is the pattern. The classifier would therefore pick up phase/sequence information (timing of troughs and peaks) rather than isolated spikes.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries (coarse comparison):\\n- Label 0 (Mirage) summary emphasizes strong positive SHAP at very-low frequencies in mid window (~26\u201365), a trough near t~25 followed by a sustained slow rise to mid peaks, and a final large low-frequency terminal rise. The sample\u2019s local and global structure (early high start, deep trough ~25, smooth mid rise and central peak ~68\u201375, later trough and strong final rise) matches the key elements of label_0 closely.\\n- Other labels: Many other label summaries (labels 1,2,4,5,6) also describe low-frequency lobes, but their characteristic timing, relative amplitudes and asymmetries differ. For example, label 1 emphasizes a dominant mid window cycle with specific asymmetry and less attribution to early high baseline; label 3 (F-14 wings opened) often shows deeper multiple negative lobes and somewhat different timing/spacing; labels 4/5/6 have different primary-window emphasis or different peak timing/amplitude patterns. The provided dissimilar examples (labels 3.0) show different mid/late structure and more pronounced negative lobes at different positions.\\n- Quantitative matching (tentative): the sample shares the most distinctive elements with label 0: early high positive offset, trough around t~25, smooth mid trough\u2192rise and a central/late broad peak, and a strong final rise. That produces the highest match to label 0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision rationale:\\n- The four similar reference plots (Samples 41, 82, 83, 94 labeled 0.0) are visually almost identical to the test sample: same start amplitude, trough near ~25, mid hump near ~48, larger peak near ~68\u201375, trough near ~105\u2013115, and final large rise to the end. Their STFTs show the same low-frequency concentration in the same windows. This strong visual + spectral agreement confirms a near one-to-one pattern match with label 0.\\n- The two dissimilar reference examples (labels 3.0) differ in shape: they show different alignment of large negative lobes, more pronounced mid-sequence negative extremes, and different mid/high frequency nuances in STFT \u2014 reinforcing that the test sample is not label 3.\\n- Fairness & scoring: Because the test sample reproduces the hallmark label_0 pattern described in the feature summary (early large positive \u2192 trough around 25 \u2192 mid slow rise and central peak \u2192 later trough \u2192 strong terminal rise) and matches all four provided label-0 reference plots closely (both time-domain and STFT), I assign the highest similarity level.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 0 (Mirage).

Change rate: relatively steep negative slope. STFT: elevated energy at the lowest frequency row in this window. Volatility: low inside the trend (no high-frequency jitter).

Local high-frequency jitter is minimal and when present it carries little spectral power.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall features, periodicity and temporal dependence:\\n- The series is dominated by very-low-frequency (broad) components: several slow undulations across 144 points (\u2248 3 large-scale cycles). STFT confirms most energy in the lowest frequency bins aligned with the described windows.  \\n- Volatility: low within broad lobes, higher (but moderate) during transitions (especially descent from main peak and final rise). High-frequency content is weak overall and confined to small transition ripples.  \\n- Asymmetry & slopes: Rises tend to be smoother/longer and some descents somewhat steeper, producing asymmetric bulges \u2014 a pattern repeated across mid and late sections.  \\n- Temporal dependence: The discriminative pattern is the ordered sequence of broad troughs and peaks at roughly the same positions (early trough, mid hump, central major peak, late trough, final rise). These repeated, phase-consistent low-frequency motifs create a coherent contour signature rather than isolated spikes.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature summaries and preliminary labeling:\\n- Comparing the sample features to the label summaries, label_0 (Mirage) description emphasizes: strong low-frequency attribution around an early-to-mid trough\u2192smooth rise window (roughly t~26\u201365 in the summary), a pronounced central peak (~t~72\u201384), and a final broad terminal rise \u2014 plus penalization of mid/high-frequency content.  \\n- The test sample shows the same core elements: an early deep trough near t\u224820\u201328, a sustained low-vol hump in the mid-window, a pronounced central peak around t\u224868\u201376, and a final strong low-frequency rise to the end. STFT/low-frequency alignment matches the label_0 spectral pattern. Small local wiggles are low power and are not positive cues, again matching label_0 behavior.  \\n- Therefore label_0 is the best match. I assign a high similarity score (4/4) to label_0 because the sample's exact sequence of broad troughs/peaks, amplitude ranges, asymmetries, and spectral concentration correspond closely to the label_0 feature description.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check against reference samples and dissimilar labels:\\n- Reference samples 41, 82, 83, 94 (all labeled 0) are visually and spectrally very close: same large positive start, deep early trough, mid hump, strong central peak, later trough, and final rise, with STFT energy concentrated at the lowest frequencies in the same time windows. Sample 23 overlays these characteristics nearly identically (timing of extrema, amplitudes, and low-frequency power), confirming the classification and supporting the high-similarity score.  \\n- Dissimilar examples (labels 3 in the provided set) have noticeably different mid-sequence structure: more and larger negative lobes at different positions, somewhat different timing and more mid-frequency energy in some transition windows; they do not match the ordered mid-window hump + central peak + final rise pattern present here.  \\n- Consistency check: All major discriminative cues in the label_0 summary (low-frequency mid-window rise, central peak, final terminal rise, penalization of mid/high-frequency spikes) are present in Sample 23. The reference label_0 plots are nearly the same shape and STFT pattern, so scoring label_0 as 4 (high similarity) is fair and consistent.  \\nConclusion: The most accurate classification for Sample 23 is label 0 (Mirage) with similarity score 4/4.\"\n  ]\n}",

The trace begins at ~+2.2\u2013+2.4 and falls smoothly toward ~0 by ~t=12\u201313. Change rate: large negative slope (~-0.12 to -0.2 units/step early). Volatility: low (smooth monotonic descent). STFT: elevated low-frequency energy at the sequence start (bottom row brighter). Interpretation: a broad early positive lobe declining into the mid-section.\\n\\n- t = 16\u201330: Deep early trough. The signal continues downward into a minimum around t\u224824\u201328 at about -1.3 to -1.5. Shape: wide, smooth trough with low within-trough volatility. STFT: bottom-frequency band shows energy concentrated during this trough. Implication: a large-scale negative excursion (low-frequency valley).\\n\\n- t = 31\u201350: Mid early recovery and modest hump. The series climbs from the trough to cross zero and reach a modest positive hump near t\u224844\u201350 (amplitude \u2248 +0.6\u2013+0.8). Rate: moderate smooth rise (low volatility). STFT: low-frequency energy present during the rise and hump; higher-frequency content is weak.\\n\\n- t = 51\u201370: Small dip then strong mid/late positive peak. After the modest hump there is a small negative inflection (~t 52\u201358, amplitude \u2248 -0.2 to -0.4) followed by a larger smooth rise to the main mid peak around t\u224870\u201375 with amplitude \u2248 +1.4\u2013+1.6. Slope on the rise is gradual-to-moderate; the structure is low-volatility and dominated by long-wavelength content. STFT: strong energy in the lowest frequency rows over roughly t\u224860\u201380.\\n\\n- t = 71\u201395: Mid-to-late descent to a trough. After the main peak (~70s) the series falls fairly quickly into negative territory by ~t=88\u201396 (amplitude roughly -0.3 to -0.9 depending on subwindow), with some moderate slope and slightly increased mid-frequency content during the steeper descent. STFT indicates low-frequency still dominant, but small higher-frequency contribution around steeper transitions.\\n\\n- t = 96\u2013120: Late trough and low-amplitude variability. The signal remains negative with a broad trough near t\u2248110 (amplitude \u2248 -1.2 to -1.4). Volatility: generally low inside the trough, with small wiggles. STFT: low-frequency power concentrated in this late trough window.\\n\\n- t = 121\u2013143 (end): Strong terminal rise to a high positive endpoint. From \u2248t=125 the series climbs rapidly and smoothly to ~+2.3\u2013+2.4 at t=143. Rate: relatively faster upward slope than some earlier rises (~+0.12\u2013+0.18 units/step). STFT: low-frequency energy reappears at the end (bottom rows brighter). This final broad upward bulge is low-volatility and low-frequency.\\n\\nSummary of local features: the sample is structured as a sequence of large low-frequency lobes (early positive \u2192 deep trough \u2192 mid small hump \u2192 larger mid peak \u2192 late trough \u2192 strong final rise). Within-lobe volatility is low (smooth ramps), while transitions (the steeper fall after peaks and the final rise) show relatively larger slopes and small mid-frequency content.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features, periodicity and temporal dependence:\\n- Dominant frequency content: STFT shows concentrated energy in the lowest frequency bins (closest to 0 Hz) across the main event windows (start, mid windows around t\u224840\u201380, and end). High-frequency content is minimal and only appears weakly during steeper transitions.\\n- Trend & periodicity: Quasi-periodic, low-frequency undulations (roughly 2\u20133 broad lobes across 144 time steps). The pattern is long-wavelength cycles rather than repeated quick oscillations.\\n- Volatility: Low within broad lobes; slightly higher during steeper descents/rises (mid-frequency bursts visible in STFT but small relative to DC band).\\n- Temporal dependencies / ordering: The relative ordering is important \u2014 a high early positive level followed by a deep early trough, then a smooth recovery into mid positive lobes, followed by a late trough and a final strong terminal rise. The sample shows consistent phase/sequence behavior that ties multiple low-frequency events together; this ordering (timing of troughs and peaks) is a discriminative signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label descriptions and selection of candidate label:\\n- Compare to label_0 (Mirage) summary: Label_0 emphasizes strong positive early baseline, a pronounced trough around t\u224825, a smooth low-volatility upward sweep around t\u224826\u201365, further broad mid peak around t\u224870\u201384, low-frequency dominance in STFT, and a strong terminal rise. The test sample matches these key points: (1) early high start ~+2.2; (2) trough near t\u224825 at about -1.3\u2014-1.5; (3) smooth mid low-frequency rise/hump and larger mid peak ~70s; (4) late trough and final pronounced terminal rise to ~+2.3; (5) STFT confirms low-frequency concentration during those windows. Those correspondences are very strong.\\n- Compare to other labels briefly:\\n  * label_1 (Eurofighter): also low-frequency mid-window hump, but label_1 places strongest discriminative weight on a specific asymmetric mid-cycle centered ~39\u201395 and tends to discount the strong initial high and final rise. Our sample has both a strong initial positive lobe and a strong final rise which label_1 summaries noted are not strongly positively attributed. So label_1 is a less-good match.\\n  * label_2 (F-14 wings closed), label_3 (F-14 wings opened), label_4 (Harrier), label_5 (F-22), label_6 (F-15): these have some overlapping low-frequency behavior in parts, but their key temporal signatures differ (different timing/amplitude of main hump(s), different sign patterns or presence of sharper transitions). For instance, label_3 samples show more prominent early negative swings and other differing timing; label_4's discriminative single mid hump timing differs; label_5 and label_6 have different arrangement/amplitudes of mid lobes and endpoint behavior. The closest and most consistent full-match is label_0.\\n\\n- Chosen label: label 0 (Mirage). Rationale: nearly all major, temporally-ordered low-frequency events described in label_0 appear in the test sample at the same relative positions with similar amplitudes, shapes (broad smooth lobes), asymmetries (slower rises, sometimes steeper falls), and STFT low-frequency concentration.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Verification against reference samples and fairness of scoring:\\n- Reference samples (Samples 41, 82, 83, 94) labeled 0 shown here are visually and quantitatively extremely similar to the test sample: same early high start, trough near t\u224825, modest mid hump ~45\u201352, main mid peak ~68\u201375, late trough ~105\u2013116, and final strong rise to t=143. Their STFTs show the same low-frequency bright bands at nearly identical time windows. Differences between the test sample and these references are minor (noise-level or small amplitude shifts). This strongly supports a high-similarity score.\\n- Dissimilar references (Samples 79, 67 labeled 3) show more small-scale mid-sequence wiggles and different amplitude/timing of mid troughs/peaks; their STFTs show different low-frequency time-localization (and somewhat more mid-frequency power in some windows). Those samples diverge visually and in frequency-time structure from the test sample, supporting that label 3 is not a match.\\n\\nSimilarity scoring decision: Given the near one-to-one correspondence of the major events, shape, timing, low-frequency dominance, and the visual match to the four reference label_0 examples, I assign a high similarity score of 4 (high similarity) to label_0. This justifies the final classification as label 0.\\n\\n(If per-label quick similarity intuition is helpful: label_0 = 4 (high), label_1 = 2\u20133 (low-to-moderate), label_2 = 2 (low), label_3 = 1\u20132 (low), label_4 = 2 (low), label_5 = 2 (low), label_6 = 2 (low). But the required output score field contains the score for the chosen label, which is 4.)\\n\\nFinal answer: label 0 with similarity score 4 because the test sample's sequence of broad low-frequency lobes (early positive \u2192 trough at ~25 \u2192 smooth mid rises and large mid peak around 70s \u2192 late trough \u2192 strong final rise) and STFT low-frequency concentration match the label_0 pattern and the provided label_0 reference samples very closely.\"\n  ]\n}"

STFT shows some mid-frequency energy during the relatively faster descents; the classifier down-weights those sharper, higher-frequency components.\\n- Precise localized feature metrics (from the plot): the early deep trough is centered \u2248t\u224824\u201328 at amplitude \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6 (wide and smooth over ~8\u201312 steps). The main mid positive peak is centered \u2248t\u224870\u201376 at \u2248+1.6\u20131.8 (width ~10\u201318 steps). The final rise (t\u2248125\u2013143) climbs ~+1.9\u20132.5 over ~18 steps (average slope ~+0.10\u2013+0.15). Volatility inside these lobes is low (few high-frequency ripples), whereas transitions (falls) are relatively steeper and generate more mid-frequency STFT energy.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall signal characterization and relationships among features:\\n- Global trend & shape: the series is dominated by large-scale, low-frequency undulations (roughly two to three broad lobes across 144 points): initial high value \u2192 steep early descent to a wide trough (t~20\u201330) \u2192 long smooth recovery with two positive bulges in the middle (one modest at ~48 and a larger one ~70\u201376) \u2192 descent into a mid/late trough (~100\u2013115) \u2192 strong final rise to a high endpoint. The energy and SHAP attribution concentrate at the very-low-frequency band across these windows, indicating the classifier relies on coarse contour features.\\n- Periodicity & temporal dependence: quasi-periodic slow oscillation (broad cycles separated by tens of time steps). The order of events is consistent and important: the early high \u2192 deep trough \u2192 mid slow rise \u2192 major mid peak \u2192 fall \u2192 final rise sequence matches a learned phase/ordering pattern (phase-locked low-frequency lobes). SHAP shows positive attribution aligned to these time positions rather than scattered points, indicating the model uses both amplitude and timing.\\n- Volatility: volatility is low during the broad lobes (smooth ramps) and higher during faster descents/falls where STFT shows some mid-frequency content; the model penalizes those sharper components (blue at mid frequencies). Overall the sample shows low local jitter, so the dominant discriminative signal is the low-frequency envelope.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to provided label patterns and selection of best label:\\n- Comparison to label summaries: The described feature set (early high then a deep trough near t~25, followed by a smooth low\u2011frequency rise through ~26\u201365, a larger central peak around ~70\u201380, then later trough and final strong rise) is essentially the prototypical pattern in the label_0 (Mirage) description in the provided legend. The SHAP / STFT agreement (strong lowest-frequency attribution in the mid windows and supportive weak edge at start/end) also exactly matches label_0's explanation text (which emphasized concentrated low-frequency SHAP at middle windows and edge lobes). The provided similar reference samples (samples 100, 82, 55, 37) are visually almost identical in waveform, STFT and SHAP layout to sample 27.\\n- Comparison vs other labels: other label summaries either emphasize different mid-window asymmetries (label_1 has slightly different timing emphasis) or different arrangements of troughs/peaks (labels 2,3,4,5,6 show patterns that differ in relative timing, number or sign of the main lobes). The two dissimilar examples (labels 3 in references) show additional high-frequency mid-sequence wiggles and deeper negative excursions in different positions; their SHAP maps also emphasize slightly different low-frequency time windows. Sample 27 aligns best with label_0.\\n- Conclusion & similarity quantification: highest match = label 0 (Mirage). I assign similarity score 4 (high similarity) because both the fine-grained events (early high \u2192 trough at ~25 \u2192 slow mid rise \u2192 central peak at ~70 \u2192 later trough \u2192 final ascent) and the frequency/SHAP attribution pattern (very-low-frequency red concentrated in the mid windows and supportive edges) are essentially the same as the label_0 description and the four provided label_0 reference samples.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Verification against reference samples and fairness of scoring:\\n- The four similar reference samples (100,82,55,37) share the same key markers: large positive start, deep early trough around t\u224825, low-volatility slow recoveries, a two-stage mid bulge with a larger mid peak near t\u224870, and final steep climb. Their STFTs show low-frequency energy aligned with the same time windows and their SHAP heatmaps concentrate positive mass at the same bottom-frequency rows/time blocks. This strong concordance justifies the '4' score.\\n- The two dissimilar references (labels 3) contain more pronounced intermediate high-frequency oscillations and different trough/peak locations\u2014these differences produce different SHAP signatures and clearer misalignment with sample 27, further supporting label_0 assignment.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 (Mirage) with similarity score 4 because the sample's time-domain landmarks, low-frequency STFT energy placement, and low-frequency SHAP attribution match the label_0 feature summary and provided label_0 references almost exactly.\"\n  ]\n}",

There are also modest positive contributions at the very start and final edge in the lowest-frequency bin.\\n- Corresponding time-series features (detailed):\\n  - Early edge (t \u2248 0\u201313): large positive offset at t=0 (~+2.3 to +2.4) followed by a fairly steep decline to near 0 by ~t=12. Change rate \u2248 -0.15 to -0.20 units/step; STFT shows low-frequency energy but SHAP weight here is weaker than the central block.\\n  - Deep early trough (t \u2248 13\u201330): the series continues down to a broad trough around t\u224820\u201330 (min \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6). The trough is wide (~10\u201316 steps) and smooth (low volatility inside). STFT indicates strong power at the lowest frequency here; SHAP gives moderate positive attribution for the leading part of the trough.\\n  - Mid-block positive lobes (t \u2248 36\u201395) \u2014 primary discriminative structure:\\n    * First mid hump (t \u2248 38\u201352): smooth rise from negative to a modest positive local peak near +0.7\u2013+0.8. Low local volatility, dominated by very low-frequency content (STFT bright at bottom rows). SHAP strong positive at lowest frequency.\\n    * Small dip (t \u2248 52\u201360): a smooth decline to a modest negative valley (~ -0.4 to -0.5), low volatility.\\n    * Larger mid peak (t \u2248 62\u201376): pronounced smooth ascent to a larger peak around +1.4\u2013+1.6 (peak ~72\u201376). The ascent is moderate in slope and largely low-frequency; SHAP is strongly positive on the bottom frequency band here (the hottest red).\\n    * Falling flank (t \u2248 76\u201388): a descent from that mid peak toward a trough near ~ -0.3 to -0.6; this transition is somewhat faster and shows a small amount of mid-frequency energy in STFT; SHAP in mid-frequency rows is weakly neutral-to-slightly-negative here.\\n  - Late trough & final rise (t \u2248 96\u2013143): a later wide trough centered ~100\u2013118 reaching about -1.3 to -1.5, followed by a smooth final rise from ~120 to the end that arrives at a large positive endpoint \u2248 +2.3\u2013+2.4. The final rise is dominated by low-frequency energy and has modest positive SHAP at lowest frequencies.\\n- Volatility and frequency: Within the primary lobes volatility is low (smooth ramps). Small higher-frequency wiggles (amplitude ~0.05\u20130.3) appear sporadically (notably on some descent flanks) but have low STFT power and neutral/negative SHAP: the classifier downweights mid/high-frequency content and favors the broad low-frequency components.\\n- Change rates: main ramps have average slopes of order +0.05\u2013+0.20 (rising segments) and faster negative slopes on some falling flanks (~ -0.15 to -0.25) \u2014 the model gives more positive weight to the slow, broad rises and to the presence/location of large low-frequency lobes rather than to the steeper drops.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Dominant character: the series is dominated by low-frequency, large-scale undulations (3 major low-frequency cycles across the 144 points) producing a clear multi-lobe shape: early high \u2192 deep trough \u2192 mid twin-hump (small then larger) \u2192 late trough \u2192 strong final rise. STFT confirms energy concentrated at the very lowest frequency bins during the windows the SHAP map highlights.\\n- Periodicity & spacing: quasi-periodic low-frequency behavior with roughly 35\u201350 time-step spacing between major extrema (consistent lobes at early, mid, late positions). The pattern is ordered and phase-linked: an early crossing downward precedes the mid-block bulges which themselves appear in a reproducible order (smaller hump then larger hump) \u2014 the classifier uses this ordering.\\n- Volatility: low within broad lobes (smooth shapes), higher only during some descent flanks; mid/high-frequency components are weak overall and are penalized by SHAP.\\n- Feature combination: classification evidence comes from the presence, amplitude, timing and relative ordering of broad low-frequency bulges/troughs (the model sums positive contributions where those low-frequency events align with the learned prototype). The mid-block low-frequency lobes are the decisive evidence here; start and end bulges are supportive but secondary.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and label selection:\\n- Comparison to label summaries (key matches):\\n  - Label 0 (Mirage): summary emphasizes strong positive SHAP at very low frequencies across mid windows (approx. t\u224813\u201365 and 64\u201392), a pronounced trough near t\u224825 followed by a smooth low-volatility rise, a central larger peak ~72\u201384 and a final strong low-frequency terminal rise. This aligns very closely with this sample's: (i) early trough near t~20\u201330, (ii) mid small then larger hump around t~48 and t~72\u201376, (iii) late deep trough then final broad rise to a high endpoint. STFT & SHAP patterns match (low-frequency red concentrated in the mid windows). -> High match.\\n  - Label 1 (Eurofighter): also relies on a dominant mid-segment low-frequency asymmetric cycle (modest hump then larger hump) between ~39\u201395. Sample shares that mid-block shape, so there is partial similarity; however label-1 descriptions downplay the strong final endpoint rise and emphasize different attribution (mid window is decisive for label 1 more than start/end). -> Moderate match.\\n  - Label 2,4,5,6 (F-14 closed, Harrier, F-22, F-15): these labels describe low-frequency lobes too but with different timing, amplitude emphasis or asymmetry (e.g., Harrier's dominant hump is centered ~52\u201371 and is highly prominent; F-22 mid hump is smaller; F-15 penalizes mid-frequency sharp transitions). Sample 27 has elements in common (broad mid lobes) but the full sequence ordering and the strong final rise plus the particular trough/peak timings best match label 0's prototype. -> Low-to-moderate match.\\n  - Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): dissimilar examples show multiple smaller, more irregular mid-frequency oscillations and deeper negative excursions at different positions; those do not align well with sample 27 which is smoother and matches the label-0 motif. -> Low/no match.\\n- Preliminary label pick: label 0 (Mirage) is the best match based on the combination of early trough \u2192 smooth mid twin-hump (small then larger) \u2192 late trough \u2192 strong terminal rise, and the SHAP low-frequency attribution pattern.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference examples and similarity scoring:\\n- The four provided 'similar' reference samples are all labeled 0 and are visually almost identical to Sample 27 in: overall shape, positions of troughs/peaks, spacing of lobes, STFT low-frequency concentration in the same time windows, and SHAP bottom-row positive attribution across the mid block. The template provided for label 0 in the long feature summary maps directly to the sample's local and global features (timing of trough near t~25, mid rises around t~48 and t~72\u201380, final rise to high endpoint). Given that close match to multiple training examples and to the feature summary, the final classification should be label 0 with high confidence.\\n\\nSimilarity scores assigned (1\u20134) comparing Sample 27 to each label\u2019s summary & example set:\\n  - label 0 (Mirage): 4 (high similarity \u2014 near-identical timing, amplitude and SHAP/STFT signature; matches multiple provided references)\\n  - label 1 (Eurofighter): 3 (moderate \u2014 shares the mid-block two-stage hump but differs in the relative importance of initial/final bulges and some asymmetry)\\n  - label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 2 (low-moderate \u2014 has some trough/hump repetition like label 2, but timings/relative amplitudes differ)\\n  - label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 1 (no/very low similarity \u2014 different mid-sequence microstructure and frequency attribution)\\n  - label 4 (Harrier): 2 (low-moderate \u2014 Harrier emphasizes a single dominant mid hump; sample has additional lobes and final rise that shift it away)\\n  - label 5 (F-22): 2 (low-moderate \u2014 F-22 has mid humps but typically different amplitude/timing patterns)\\n  - label 6 (F-15): 2 (low-moderate \u2014 some shared low-frequency envelope but notable differences in transitions and penalized mid-frequency bursts)\\n\\nFinal verification & conclusion:\\n- The STFT (low-frequency concentration in mid windows) and the SHAP heatmap (strong red at bottom rows aligned with mid-block lobes) both corroborate that the classifier is using large-scale slow contour features in the 39\u2013104 window to push the prediction toward label 0.\\n- The multiple provided reference samples labeled 0 are visually and spectrally nearly identical; their SHAP heatmaps and time-series motifs line up with Sample 27, confirming the selection is consistent and fair.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 (Mirage) with similarity score 4.\"\n  ]\n}",

There are smaller positive contributions at the very beginning (~0\u20135) and near the final segment (~130\u2013143) but these are weaker. Mapping those high-SHAP low-frequency blocks onto the raw trace: (a) Early block (weak): the series starts very high at t=0 (~+2.3) and descends toward 0 over the first ~12 steps \u2014 low-frequency downward baseline that has small positive SHAP. (b) Main mid-block (strong): from t\u224825 there is a pronounced trough (~-1.4 to -1.6 at ~t=24\u201328) followed by a smooth, low-volatility upward sweep into a two-stage mid-section: an intermediate hump around t\u224845 (\u2248+0.6\u20130.8) then a larger slow rise to the dominant mid-peak around t\u224870\u201375 (\u2248+1.5\u20131.8). This trough\u2192slow rise\u2192broad peak pattern is low-frequency (STFT bottom rows show high energy there), low local volatility (few sharp wiggles), and typical slope from trough to major peak is modest (~+0.05\u2013+0.07 units/step averaged over the long ramp). (c) After the mid-peak the signal descends at a somewhat faster rate into a mid-late dip (around t\u224885\u201395 negative), then eventually performs a sustained final rise from \u2248t=125 to 143 reaching a large positive endpoint (~+2.4). The STFT confirms the attribution windows correspond to concentrated energy at the very-low-frequency bins; higher-frequency rows have little power in these intervals, consistent with SHAP highlighting low-frequency contributions. In short: the classifier\u2019s positive evidence is tied to large, smooth low-frequency lobes located early/mid/late \u2014 especially the mid trough\u2192rise\u2192peak structure (t~25\u219270) and the final broad rise (t~125\u2192143).\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and temporal dependence: The trace is dominated by a small number (2\u20134) of broad, low-frequency undulations across the 144 points: (1) a high starting offset with a smooth initial descent into a deep early trough (t~13\u201330), (2) a composite midsection with two broad positive lobes (small hump ~45 and larger hump ~70) separated by troughs, (3) a mid-late dip and (4) a strong final broad rise to the largest endpoint value. Volatility is generally low within these lobes (smooth ramps), with somewhat faster transitions when the signal falls from peaks (asymmetry: rises are generally slower than some falls). The STFT shows most energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins during the positive-SHAP windows, indicating the discriminative content is long-wavelength/global-contour information rather than short, noisy spikes. Temporal dependence is clear: the order trough\u2192slow rise\u2192mid-peak\u2192fall\u2192final rise is preserved and the classifier appears to require this sequencing of broad-scale lobes (phase/ordering matters).\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries: Comparing the observed local and global features to the provided label summaries: \u2022 Label 0 (Mirage) summary emphasizes strong positive SHAP at very-low frequencies in mid windows (notably trough around t~13\u201330, slow rise mid-window, broad central peak around t~70, and final broad rise), low volatility inside broad lobes, and negative attribution for mid/high-frequency content.

Change rate is relatively large at the beginning (steep negative slope), volatility low (smooth). STFT shows elevated energy in the lowest-frequency band in this early block. This is a slow, large-scale downward ramp.\\n- t = 16\u201330: the series continues down into a pronounced trough; the minimum (~-1.3 to -1.5) occurs roughly between t\u224818\u201326 with very low local volatility (smooth trough). STFT maintains power at the lowest frequencies in this window. This is a broad negative lobe (wide valley) lasting ~8\u201312 steps.\\n- t = 31\u201350: recovery and a modest mid positive hump: values climb from trough up through small rebound near t\u224828\u201332, reach a moderate positive peak (~+0.6 to +0.8) near t\u224842\u201348, then decline toward slightly negative by t\u224854. The rise is smooth and moderate in slope; volatility remains low. STFT shows low-frequency energy concentrated on the rising-to-peak interval.\\n- t = 51\u201375: a dominant, broad positive bulge is evident \u2014 a relatively smooth rise beginning ~t\u224856 that peaks around t\u224870 at roughly +1.5 to +1.8, followed by a fall. This event is one of the largest mid-sequence positive excursions; STFT shows strong power at the lowest frequency rows during this interval. Change rates are moderate, and the shape is a broad convex bump with low micro-volatility.\\n- t = 76\u201395: after the mid peak the series falls to a modest negative region (around -0.4 to -0.7 near t\u224882), then a small positive rebound appears (peak \u2248+0.4 near t\u224894).

There are roughly 2\u20133 broad low-frequency lobes across the 144 points (consistent, separated by ~20\u201340 time steps). This creates a multi-lobe envelope rather than high-rate oscillation.\\n- Volatility: low within main lobes (smooth ramps and plateaus), higher (but still moderate) around some transitions. High-frequency noise is minimal and does not dominate.\\n- Asymmetry & change-rate patterns: rises tend to be smoother/longer and falls sometimes steeper (asymmetric bulges), e.g., the large mid bulge builds moderately then drops more quickly; the final rise is comparatively steep. The classifier would likely use these ordered low-frequency events (their timing and relative amplitudes) as the discriminative signature rather than local high-frequency features.\\n- Temporal dependence: key events occur at consistent relative positions (early high and early trough, strong mid bulge around t\u224865\u201375, late deep trough around t\u2248104\u2013116, final climb) and these combine additively to define the overall contour signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to provided label feature summaries and initial label selection:\\n- Comparison to label_0 (Mirage): the label_0 summary emphasizes strong positive SHAP at very-low-frequency rows around 13\u201330, a mid-window smooth rise from ~26\u201365, a pronounced central peak around 64\u201392, and a strong final broad rise to a large positive endpoint. The test sample shows the same pattern: early high then deep trough, a smooth mid rise and a large central peak near t\u224870, a late trough near t\u2248110 and a strong final rise. STFT low-frequency alignment matches. Visual similarity to the provided label_0 reference plots (samples 83, 7, 38, 100) is very high \u2014 those reference samples almost superimpose with this test sample. Strong match.\\n- Comparison to other labels:\\n  * label_1 (Eurofighter): also favors low-frequency mid-window cycles, but the label_1 description discounts early large declines and late rises and focuses more narrowly on an asymmetric two-stage mid hump. Our sample has very strong early and final large positive endpoints which, for label_1, were described as less decisive. The sample's entire envelope (especially final rise) is more consistent with label_0 than label_1.\\n  * label_2, label_3, label_4, label_5, label_6: all mention low-frequency components, but their characteristic timing and shapes differ (e.g., label_2 and label_3 emphasize different trough/peak timing and counts; label_4 centers a single dominant hump at ~52\u201371 but with different surrounding trough structure; label_5 and label_6 have different amplitude/phase patterns). The test series matches label_0's three-lobe, low-frequency signature most closely.\\n- Initial selection: label 0 (Mirage) is the best match based on timing, amplitude, low-frequency emphasis, asymmetry, and the same multi-lobe envelope described in the label_0 pattern.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 similarity quantification to each label (integer 1\u20134), as requested in the analysis (shown here for completeness):\\n- label_0 (Mirage): 4 (high similarity). Reason: near-identical multi-lobe timing, amplitudes (early/high and final high), smooth low-frequency bulges, and visual match to the provided label_0 examples.\\n- label_1 (Eurofighter): 2 (low similarity). Reason: shares mid low-frequency hump but the importance and pattern of early decline and final rise differ; label_1 downweights early/final extremes.\\n- label_2 (F-14 wings closed): 2 (low similarity). Reason: label_2 shows early steep fall plus repeated troughs at different timings, but the precise arrangement and mid-peak structure do not match as well as label_0.\\n- label_3 (F-14 wings opened): 1 (no similarity). Reason: label_3 examples have different arrangement and deeper mid troughs and different rhythm of lobes.\\n- label_4 (Harrier): 2 (low similarity). Reason: Harrier emphasizes a single dominant mid hump with different contrast to surrounding troughs; our sample has multiple large lobes and a strong final rise consistent with Mirage.\\n- label_5 (F-22): 2 (low similarity). Reason: F-22 exhibits a primary mid hump but with different amplitude pattern and less prominent early/final peaks; not as close.\\n- label_6 (F-15): 2 (low similarity). Reason: some broad low-frequency envelope similarity but key mid/late transitions and the strong final rise align better with label_0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Verification against reference samples and final decision reasoning:\\n- The four provided similar reference traces (samples 83, 7, 38, 100) are all labeled 0 and visually nearly identical to the test sample: same early high, deep early trough, mid moderate hump followed by stronger central peak around t\u224870, later trough and final broad rise. Their STFTs also align with the test sample: concentrated low-frequency energy in the same time windows. This confirms the test sample is from the same prototypical pattern used to characterize label_0.\\n- The dissimilar reference samples (samples 67, 17) labeled 3 show more high-frequency micro-oscillations mid-sequence and different lobing/phase; they do not match the test sample. That further supports excluding label_3 and nearby classes.\\n- The classifier's feature-attribution descriptions for label_0 emphasize low-frequency positive SHAP at early, mid, and late windows; the test sample presents those exact features. The combination of matched timing, amplitude ranges, shape (smooth broad bulges/troughs), and STFT low-frequency concentration supports assigning label 0 with high confidence.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 0 (Mirage). Similarity score for chosen label: 4 (high similarity).\"\n    ]\n}",

Change rate ~ -0.18 to -0.2 units/step, low local volatility (no high-frequency jitter). STFT: elevated energy in the lowest-frequency row at these times. Manifestation: a broad, low-frequency downward ramp.\\n- t=13\u201330: Deep broad trough centered \u2248t=20\u201326 with minimum near -1.2 to -1.5. The trough is wide (\u224810\u201315 steps), low volatility (smooth), dominated by very-low-frequency content in STFT. This is a sustained low-frequency negative lobe.\\n- t=30\u201344: Recovery and a moderate positive hump reaching \u2248+0.6 to +0.8 around t\u224840\u201345. Slope is moderate for the ascent, volatility remains low. STFT still concentrated near the bottom frequency.\\n- t=45\u201372: Strong mid-section rise culminating in a pronounced peak around t\u224868\u201372 (amplitude \u2248+1.5 to +1.8). The rise is relatively gradual (low-frequency), the subsequent fall is somewhat steeper (asymmetric). STFT: clear energy concentration at the very-low-frequency bins over this window.\\n- t=72\u201395: Decline after the main peak into a negative/near-zero zone (local troughs around t\u224886\u201395, amplitudes around -0.4 to -1.0). Some slight increases in mid-frequency content during the steeper descent, but primary power remains at low frequencies.\\n- t=95\u2013116: Another negative trough culminating near t\u2248110\u2013116 (\u2248 -1.2 to -1.4). The trough is broad and smooth; volatility low inside the trough. STFT shows low-frequency dominance in the trough window.\\n- t=116\u2013143: Strong final recovery and monotonic rise from the late trough to a high positive endpoint \u2248+2.3\u2013+2.5 at t=143. The terminal rise is relatively fast compared with mid rises but still shows strong very-low-frequency energy in STFT (large-scale bulge). Volatility remains low overall except in the steeper transitional slopes.\\n\\nStep 1 \u2014 Frequency/substructure notes: STFT heatmap shows the strongest energy at the bottommost (very-low) frequency bins aligned with the main time windows (start decline, mid hump, late trough and final rise). Mid/higher frequency bands are weak overall and only slightly present during some of the steeper transitions; these do not dominate the spectral view.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal dependencies:\\n- Dominant character: the sample is governed by large-scale, low-frequency undulations (3 main large lobes/troughs: early trough, mid pronounced peak, late trough + final endpoint rise). Energy and attribution concentrate at the lowest frequency, indicating global contour/shape rather than fine texture drives the pattern.\\n- Periodicity & ordering: quasi-periodic slow cycles spaced tens of steps apart (roughly 40\u201350 step separation between major extrema). The ordering matters: initial high \u2192 deep trough \u2192 mid hump \u2192 trough \u2192 final rise. The mid hump (~t=65\u201372) is the most prominent discriminative event.\\n- Volatility: low inside the broad lobes (smooth ramps). Higher instantaneous slopes occur during descents/final rise but do not introduce strong high-frequency spectral power. Overall the trace matches a low-volatility, low-frequency envelope with asymmetric rises and faster falls in places.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label feature summaries and selection:\\n- Match to label 0 (Mirage): The sample matches the label_0 description closely: (a) early large positive baseline and steep early descent into a trough; (b) a sustained smooth mid-window rise and a strong central peak around t\u224865\u201380; (c) low local volatility (weak high-frequency content) and energy concentrated in lowest frequency bins; (d) final broad terminal rise to a large positive endpoint. These elements are described repeatedly for label_0 and precisely mirror the provided reference label-0 examples.\\n- Comparison to other labels: Other classes (labels 1,2,3,4,5,6) also emphasize low-frequency lobes in some cases, but notable distinguishing features for label_0 are the specific timing and ordering (early high \u2192 trough near t\u224820\u201330 \u2192 mid hump around t\u224865\u201380 \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise). The sample follows that sequence very closely. STFT pattern (dominant bottom row at those windows) also matches label_0 references.\\n- Therefore the highest matching label is label 0 (Mirage). Given the near one-to-one correspondence in amplitude, timing, low-frequency dominance and shape asymmetries with the label_0 feature summary, similarity is scored as high.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples:\\n- The four provided 'similar' reference samples (samples labeled 0.0) are visually nearly identical in waveform shape (early high, trough near t\u224820\u201330, mid hump at \u224840\u201372, central large peak ~68\u201372, late trough and final rise) and their STFTs show the same bottom-row concentrated energy. Test sample 57\u2019s morphology and STFT match those references strongly.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' references (label 3.0) show more oscillatory mid-sequence small ripples and a different arrangement of peaks/troughs; their STFTs show comparatively more energy in slightly higher low-frequency rows at times where our sample has none. This increases confidence that label 3 is not a match.\\n\\nFinal decision & score justification:\\n- Chosen label: label 0 (Mirage). Rationale: near-exact match in temporal positions of main extrema, amplitudes of peaks/troughs, low volatility within lobes, asymmetry of rise/fall, and STFT concentration at the lowest frequency rows \u2014 all hallmarks from the label_0 feature summary and matching reference plots.\\n- Similarity score: 4 (high similarity).

      "{\n    \"result\": [\"label 0\"],\n    \"score\": [4],\n    \"rationale\": [\n        \"Step 1 \u2014 Local (red SHAP) feature description (fine-grained):\\n- SHAP identifies strong positive attribution concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows across a broad middle time band (roughly t\u224813 through t\u2248104, with peak intensity around t\u224839\u201392). I break this into three clearly visible low-frequency events in the trace that line up with the red SHAP blocks:\\n  1) Early trough window (t\u22488\u201330): the series falls from a high start (~+2.3 at t=0) through zero near t\u224812 and reaches a wide local minimum around t\u224825 (amplitude \u2248 -1.3 to -1.5). Change rate: large negative average slope during the descent (~-0.18 to -0.25 units/step over \u224812\u201318 steps). Volatility: low inside the trough (smooth, sustained low values), only small local wiggles (~0.1\u20130.3) around the trough bottom. STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin in this same time region \u2014 consistent with a long-wavelength (broad) feature. Interpretation: the model treats this wide, low-frequency valley as positive evidence.\\n  2) Mid slow-rise and double-hump (t\u224836\u201382): after the trough the trace rises smoothly to a modest hump near t\u224848\u201356 (amplitude \u2248 +0.6\u20130.8), dips a little (t\u224856\u201362), then continues to a larger broad peak around t\u224870\u201376 (amplitude \u2248 +1.6\u20131.8). Change rates: the mid slow-rise is gradual (average slope \u2248 +0.05\u2013+0.07 units/step from trough\u2192midpeak), while the ascent into the larger central peak is somewhat faster but still low-frequency (moderate slope). Volatility: low inside the hump/peak regions (no high-frequency spikes). STFT: again shows strongest energy at the lowest frequencies aligned with these times. SHAP: strongest positive at the bottom frequency rows here, indicating these broad convex contour features are primary positive contributors.\\n  3) Late trough + final rise (t\u2248100\u2013143): the signal falls to a second wide negative trough around t\u2248104\u2013120 (min \u2248 -1.2 to -1.4), then recovers in a sustained, fairly rapid terminal rise from \u2248t\u2248125 to the end (t=143) reaching \u2248+2.3. Change rates: the late descent is moderate-to-steep; the final rise to the endpoint is the fastest positive slope seen in later windows (\u2248+0.12\u2013+0.16 units/step over \u224820 steps). STFT: low-frequency energy reappears during the late rise; SHAP bottom-row again shows positive attribution at the end (though weaker than mid-window peak). Volatility: final rise is relatively smooth.\\n- Across these red-attributed windows the common frequency signature is dominance at the lowest STFT bin (very low frequency / broad shape). Higher-frequency rows show little energy and often neutral/negative SHAP. That confirms the model is crediting slow, large-scale shape features (broad peaks/troughs) rather than short spikes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series summary and temporal dependence:\\n- Global trend & morphology: The trace is dominated by large, slow undulations (quasi-periodic low-frequency envelope) with 2\u20133 large-scale lobes across 144 steps: an early large descent into a wide trough, a mid-sequence recovery with two ordered broad humps (smaller hump then larger hump), a later descent to a second trough, and a strong final rise to a high endpoint. Amplitudes range roughly from -1.5 to +2.4 (large global swing).\\n- Periodicity & frequency content: STFT shows most signal energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins during the main events; mid/high-frequency bands are weak. The shape is long-wavelength (broad curvature) with occasional small high-frequency ripples during transitions but these have low power and correspondingly low or slightly negative SHAP.\\n- Volatility: Low volatility inside large lobes (smooth ramps). Higher instantaneous slope occurs during transitions (early descent and final rise) but still dominated by low-frequency energy. There are small amplitude wiggles (\u22480.1\u20130.3) around troughs and during some transitions but they do not drive the classification.\\n- Temporal dependence & ordering: Important \u2014 the classifier appears to use the ordering and relative amplitude of the broad lobes (early high \u2192 deep trough \u2192 mid small hump \u2192 mid large hump \u2192 late trough \u2192 terminal rise). The mid-sequence two-stage hump (smaller then larger) and the timing of these low-frequency events are distinctive.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label summaries and selection of best label:\\n- Compare to provided label feature descriptions:\\n  * Label 0 (Mirage): description emphasises strong positive SHAP at very-low-frequency rows in mid windows (t\u224826\u201365 in the provided summary), a trough near t\u224825 then a smooth monotonic rise to mid positives, a central broad peak around t\u224872\u201384, and a strong final broad rise. That matches this sample closely: same early trough (~t25), mid small hump then larger hump (~t48 and ~t72), and a large final rise. STFT low-frequency dominance and SHAP positive concentration align exactly. -> High similarity.\\n  * Label 1 (Eurofighter): also relies on mid-segment low-frequency oscillation but its summary emphasizes a pronounced asymmetric mid-cycle with a small hump then a larger hump and a steeper fall; some late rise is noted but the summary down-weights early large baseline. Our sample shares the mid two-hump structure but also has strong supporting early baseline and terminal rise that Label 0 explicitly emphasizes; label 1's summary places less importance on the edges. -> Moderate similarity, but overall label 0 matches edges and multiple red blocks better.\\n  * Label 2,3,4,5,6: all describe low-frequency lobes too, but with different timing, amplitude patterns or characteristic shapes (e.g., label 2 has troughs at different positions and repetition timing; label 3 emphasizes distinct negative deep troughs and particular pulses; label 4 centers on a dominant single mid hump for Harrier; label 5 and 6 have different hump placements and different penalization of mid-frequency bursts). The strongest one-to-one match by timing, shape, ordering, and SHAP pattern is label 0.\\n- Selected label: label 0 (Mirage). Quantified similarity to labels (1\u20134 scale): label 0 = 4 (high similarity); label 1 = 3 (moderate similarity because of shared two-stage mid hump but less match on edges and relative weighting); label 2 = 2 (some low-frequency trough/peak structure present but timing/order differs); label 3 = 1\u20132 (lower similarity \u2014 dissimilar SHAP pattern and more mid-frequency detail in dissimilar examples); label 4 = 2; label 5 = 2; label 6 = 2. (Final chosen = label 0 with score 4.)\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against reference samples and SHAP consistency:\\n- The four similar reference samples shown are all label 0 and their raw traces, STFTs and SHAP heatmaps are nearly identical in morphology and SHAP localization to the test sample (same early trough near t\u224825, same mid two-hump pattern, same central strong low-frequency SHAP block and final rise). This reinforces the classification; the similarity of STFT low-frequency energy distribution and localized red bottom-row SHAP across mid windows is a strong confirmatory signal.\\n- The two dissimilar reference samples (label 3) show more irregular mid-sequence high-frequency ripples and a different arrangement of large lobes; their SHAP maps either highlight different time columns or show different sign patterns in mid-frequency rows. Those differences in both time and frequency domain make label 3 a poor match here.\\n- Fairness & scoring logic: the score for label 0 (4) is supported by an almost exact alignment in: (a) timing of major low-frequency events (positions of troughs and peaks), (b) ordering (trough\u2192small hump\u2192larger hump\u2192trough\u2192final rise), (c) STFT energy and SHAP concentration at the lowest frequency rows during the same windows, and (d) matching reference examples. No other label matches this combination as closely.\\n\\nConclusion: The test sample is best classified as label 0 (Mirage). Final reported score for this label: 4 (high similarity). Additional per-label similarity notes were given above to justify the ranking.\"\n    ]\n}"

Volatility is generally low inside each broad event, with steeper (but still low-frequency) transitions between events.\\n- Periodicity & count of lobes: The series shows multiple broad lobes (roughly three main positive lobes and two wide negative troughs), spaced by tens of time steps \u2014 consistent with the slow oscillatory patterns described for the Mirage class in the provided label summaries.\\n- Temporal dependence & asymmetry: Asymmetric rises/falls are present (e.g., slower build to some peaks, faster falls in some segments). The ordering of events (early high -> deep early trough -> mid small hump -> larger mid/central peak -> late trough -> final big rise) is a coherent pattern: the presence, amplitude and ordering of these large-scale lobes define the sample's signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 match to provided label feature lists (which label best matches?):\\n- Matching with label_0 (Mirage): The label_0 description repeatedly emphasizes (a) strong low-frequency energy concentrated in start, mid (\u2248 t~26\u201365) and later windows, (b) a deep trough near t~25 then a smooth monotonic rise in the mid window and a pronounced central peak around t~72\u201384, and (c) a strong final broad rise. The test sample contains each of these: early large positive baseline followed by a deep trough near t~20\u201330, a smooth mid-sequence rise then a pronounced central peak ~t=70\u201375, a late trough ~t=105\u2013116, and a final large rise to a high endpoint. STFT alignment and the low-volatility ramps match label_0's emphasis on low\u2011frequency, large-scale contour features. Match rating: high.\\n- Comparison vs other labels:\\n  - label_1 (Eurofighter): Also relies on a dominant mid-segment low-frequency asymmetric cycle (rise to a large mid-peak then faster fall). Sample 69 contains a mid/central peak and an asymmetric rise/fall there, so there is some overlap. However, label_1 descriptions de-emphasize early large decline and emphasize a specific mid-cycle phasing and that late rise may be neutral; sample 69's extensive early troughs and strong final rise align more strongly with label_0. Match rating: moderate.\\n  - label_2 (F-14 wings closed): Characterized by multiple distinct low-frequency trough/hump blocks at specific times (early decline to trough, mid humps, late trough and final rise). This is somewhat similar but label_2 descriptions place different relative timings and emphasis (strong red blocks at windows that do not exactly line up). Sample 69 is closer to label_0's prototypical arrangement. Match rating: low\u2013moderate.\\n  - label_3 (F-14 wings opened): Also low-frequency dominated but often shows deep troughs and different mid-level small oscillatory texture; the dissimilar reference samples for label_3 show more varied mid-high frequency texture and different arrangement. Match rating: low.\\n  - label_4 (Harrier): Emphasizes a single dominant mid-segment large positive bump (very strong) with clear trough\u2192big rise contrast. Sample 69 has several mid bumps and a central peak but not a single isolated dominant mid hump that overwhelms others; moreover sample has strong early and final features. Match rating: low.\\n  - label_5 (F-22): Has a primary hump roughly in mid 36\u201370 but with smaller endpoint emphasis; sample 69 has similar mid-lobe structure but also the strong early baseline and final rise that are more characteristic of Mirage. Match rating: low.\\n  - label_6 (F-15): Long persistent low-frequency envelope and repeated broad oscillations are described for label_6; sample 69 does show repeated broad oscillations, but the distinct pattern of troughs/peaks and the specific phasing (deep early trough near t~25, central peak near ~70, large final rise) matches label_0 more closely. Match rating: low\u2013moderate.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 verification against the provided reference samples and re-checking logic:\\n- The four highly similar reference samples provided are all labeled 0 and their plots are visually nearly identical to the test sample: same large positive start, downward ramp to a deep trough near t~20\u201330, mid small hump then larger central peak near t~70, deep trough ~t=105\u2013116, and strong terminal rise. Their STFTs show the same concentration of energy in the lowest frequency bins at matching time windows. This is compelling corroboration that the test sample belongs to label_0.\\n- The two dissimilar references are labeled 3 and show more high-frequency internal structure and different mid-segment behavior; they do not align with the test sample's dominant low-frequency signature. That further supports the distinction from label_3.\\n- Scoring rationale (consistency & fairness): given near one-to-one alignment between the test sample's local events, their timing, amplitude patterns, asymmetries, and the STFT low-frequency concentration with the label_0 feature summary and label_0 reference samples, it is appropriate to assign the highest similarity level (4) to label_0. Other labels show at most partial overlap (mid-hump similarity to label_1 or label_5) but lack the complete sequence of matching low-frequency events and terminal behaviour, so they are scored lower in the internal comparison above.\\n\\nFinal quantitative similarity summary (used to cross-check; only the chosen-label score is returned in the top-level 'score'):\\n- label_0 (Mirage): 4 (high similarity \u2014 timing, amplitude, number/order of low-frequency lobes, STFT pattern and reference examples match closely).\\n- label_1 (Eurofighter): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 shares mid-segment low-frequency hump but lacks exact phasing emphasis and the early/final features differ).\\n- label_2 (F-14 wings closed): 2 (low\u2013moderate similarity \u2014 shares some trough/hump patterning but not the precise timing/relative amplitudes of label_2 examples).\\n- label_3 (F-14 wings opened): 2 (low similarity \u2014 reference examples differ in mid-frequency texture and event arrangement).\\n- label_4 (Harrier): 2 (low similarity \u2014 Harrier expects a dominant single mid hump; sample has a more distributed multi-lobe pattern).\\n- label_5 (F-22): 2 (low similarity \u2014 some mid hump resemblance but endpoint/early structure differs).\\n- label_6 (F-15): 2 (low\u2013moderate similarity \u2014 both emphasize low-frequency envelope, but the precise sequence and key local features match label_0 better).\\n\\nConclusion: the sample matches label 0 (Mirage) with high confidence. The provided score [4] quantifies that high similarity to label_0 (per the scoring rubric).\"\n  ]\n}",

The principal energy lies in the very-low-frequency band (STFT bottom rows), so global contour-scale features dominate.\",\n    \" - Volatility: Low within broad events; higher instantaneous slopes during transitions (e.g., initial fall and final rise). Small high-frequency wiggles exist but have low amplitude and little spectral power, thus little influence on classification.\",\n    \" - Temporal dependence & asymmetry: The sample shows asymmetric half-cycles \u2014 rises are often more gradual than some of the falls (the central rise is smooth and sustained while the subsequent drop is steeper). Timing of lobes is consistent: an early large descent into a trough near t\u224825, a mid/central broad peak around t\u224870\u201375, a late trough near t\u2248110\u2013118, and a large terminal rise.

It also stresses dominance of very-low-frequency components and that mid/high-frequency content is penalized. The sample's local and global features match these points very closely: early high \u2192 trough ~25 \u2192 smooth mid-to-central rise/peak \u2192 later trough \u2192 final strong rise; STFT alignment (lowest-frequency energy at those windows) also matches. This is a near one-to-one mapping of distinctive features. Strong match.\",\n    \" - Compare to label_1 (Eurofighter): label_1 emphasizes a dominant mid-segment asymmetric hump (39\u201395) but notes that early large declines and some late rises are not positively attributed for that class. Our sample places strong positive structure at early and final edges as well as mid-late center; moreover the exact timing and multi-lobe pattern (early trough ~25 then central peak ~70 then late trough ~110 and final rise) is more consistent with label_0 than label_1. Moderate-to-low match.\",\n    \" - Compare to label_2 (F-14 wings closed): label_2 contains multiple troughs and humps but typically identifies troughs centered slightly earlier/later and repetition pattern differs; label_2's emphasized windows differ in timing and the sample's precise sequence of mid/late peaks and final rise align better with label_0. Low-to-moderate match.\",\n    \" - Compare to label_3 (F-14 wings opened): label_3 often shows several large negative lobes and different timing/shape characteristics (and some high-frequency mid-wiggles). The sample does not show the same strong repeated negative pulses or the same mid-high frequency texture; low match.\",\n    \" - Compare to label_4 (Harrier), label_5 (F-22), label_6 (F-15): These labels emphasize other distinctive single or dominant mid humps (Harrier), different amplitude patterns and penalize certain mid-frequency content differently. While there are commonalities (low-frequency lobes are a general motif across many classes), the precise ordered pattern (early high, early deep trough ~25, smooth mid-to-central rise and a pronounced central peak ~70\u201375, late trough ~110 and final large terminal rise) corresponds almost exactly to the label_0 template. Low match to labels 4\u20136 relative to label_0.\",\n    \"Conclusion of Step 3: The highest matching degree is label_0 (Mirage). I assign the similarity score 4 (high similarity) to label_0 because the sample's detailed events, timings, amplitudes and spectral concentration in the lowest-frequency bins match the label_0 description and the provided reference label_0 examples very closely.

Their STFTs show very similar low-frequency energy concentration across the corresponding windows. The test sample overlay and STFT align tightly with these references \u2014 both in shape and in spectral content. This confirms a very high match to label_0.\",\n    \" - Comparison to the two 'dissimilar' references (Samples 79, 39 labeled 3): Those show more mid-sequence higher-frequency substructure and different trough/peak timings and amplitudes; their patterns deviate from the test sample notably and therefore are not convincing alternatives.\",\n    \" - Fairness and scoring logic: The scoring follows the guideline that '4' means there is an explicit reference feature description matching the sample and the reference plots look almost identical. That is satisfied here: the label_0 feature summary explicitly lists windows and shapes that mirror the test sample. The references for label_0 provided with the task are nearly identical to the test sample, so awarding top score (4) is consistent and fair.\",\n    \" - Final decision: label 0 (Mirage) with similarity score 4.

STFT: clear low-frequency energy at the sequence start.\\n- t = 13\u201330: Deep, wide trough. Values fall to about -1.2 to -1.5 (min around t\u224824\u201328). Shape: broad valley, low volatility inside the trough (no high-frequency spikes). STFT: low-frequency band energy concentrated here.\\n- t = 31\u201352: Smooth recovery / mid hump. The series rises from trough through zero to a modest positive peak ~+0.7\u2013+0.85 around t\u224844\u201352. Trend: gradual upward ramp, low volatility, dominated by very-low frequencies in STFT.\\n- t = 53\u201376: Second larger positive bulge. After a small dip (~t\u224854\u201360 down to \u2248 -0.3 to -0.5) the signal rises again to a more pronounced peak \u2248 +1.4\u2013+1.6 centered \u2248 t=70\u201374. Change rates: moderate-to-steep ascent into the peak, then a faster descent. STFT: again concentrated low-frequency energy aligned to this window.\\n- t = 77\u201396: Mid-late decline and small rebound. The signal falls from the central peak down through near-zero to a local negative around t\u224886\u201392 (\u2248 -0.4 to -0.8), with small higher-frequency wiggles but still low overall volatility. STFT: low-frequency remains dominant; mid-frequency content weak.\\n- t = 97\u2013120: Late trough. The series reaches another wide trough around t\u2248110\u2013118 with values near -1.2 to -1.5. Shape: broad, smooth valley (low volatility) rather than sharp spiking. STFT: energy again concentrated at the lowest frequency rows for this block.\\n- t = 121\u2013143: Strong terminal rise. From the late trough the trace climbs steadily and relatively quickly to a large positive endpoint \u2248 +2.3\u2013+2.6 at t=143. This final segment is low-frequency dominated and has a relatively high average slope compared with earlier rises.\\n\\nSupporting frequency evidence: The STFT heatmap shows the dominant spectral magnitude concentrated in the lowest frequency rows (near 0\u20130.06 normalized Hz) during the key windows above (start, mid humps, late trough and final rise). Higher-frequency rows show only weak energy, confirming features are broad/low-frequency rather than sharp high-frequency events.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary, temporal dependence and combinations:\\n- Global description: The sample is dominated by 2\u20133 large-scale low-frequency undulations across the 144 points: (1) a high positive start \u2192 steep descent \u2192 early deep trough; (2) a smooth mid recovery and a larger mid positive peak; (3) mid-late decline into a second deep trough and (4) a strong final rise to a high endpoint. These are broad, low-volatility lobes spaced tens of steps apart (quasi-periodic envelope).\\n- Frequency/volatility: Low volatility within the broad lobes, occasional small-amplitude higher-frequency ripples during transitions but with low power. STFT confirms energy concentrated in lowest frequency bins at the windows that matter.\\n- Temporal dependencies: The classifier-relevant structure is the ordering and relative timing/amplitude of the lobes (start high \u2192 trough near 25 \u2192 slow mid rise \u2192 larger mid peak near 70 \u2192 late trough \u2192 strong final rise). The mid-window smooth rise and the central bulge followed by a later trough and terminal rise form a coherent multi-stage contour signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature lists and selection of best label:\\n- Label 0 (Mirage) summary (from provided references): emphasizes strong positive low-frequency attribution at early, mid (\u224826\u201365) and mid-late windows, an early high positive baseline at t=0, a pronounced trough near t\u224825, a smooth mid-window rise (low volatility), a central broad peak near t\u224870\u201380, and a final strong rise to a large endpoint. This description matches the test sample very closely in timing, amplitude, smoothness, and STFT pattern.\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): also low-frequency mid-segment oscillation but the summary emphasizes a dominant asymmetric single mid-cycle (39\u201395) with the mid cycle being the most decisive and early/late large amplitude declines/rises less important. Our sample shows multiple low-frequency lobes (early trough, mid-and central peak, late trough and final rise). While there is overlap, label 1 puts primary weight on a different mid-focused asymmetry and discounts the early large descent \u2014 less consistent than label 0.\\n- Label 2 (F-14 wings closed) and Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): both involve low-frequency multi-stage troughs/peaks but the provided label-2 and label-3 patterns emphasize different timing and stronger negative trough signatures in different positions and sometimes steeper early falls or particular repetition patterns; label 3 reference samples (dissimilar here) show more irregular mid-frequency content. Test sample aligns more with label 0 profile than with labels 2 or 3.\\n- Label 4, 5, 6 (Harrier, F-22, F-15): their summaries emphasize a dominant single mid hump (label 4 / Harrier) or different configurations (label 5 F-22 primary hump near 36\u201370 but with specific asymmetry; label 6 F-15 persistent envelope). Our sample's multi-lobe structure with the early trough at \u224825 plus central large bulge and terminal rise matches label 0 more closely than these.\\n\\nTherefore highest matching label is label 0 (Mirage). I assign label 0 and rate the similarity to label 0 as high (score 4).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four similar reference samples (Samples 82, 100, 83, 37) are all labeled 0 and their plotted waveforms and STFTs are visually almost identical to the test sample: same initial high starting value, steep early descent into a trough near t\u224825, mid recovery to a modest hump, larger central peak near t\u224870, another trough ~110\u2013120 and strong final ascent. STFT patterns for those references show the same concentration of energy in the lowest frequency rows at the same time windows. This is strong empirical confirmation that the test sample matches label 0's prototypical signature.\\n- The two dissimilar reference samples (Samples 79 and 39, both labeled 3) show visibly different mid-sequence behaviour: their mid sections contain more irregular / higher-frequency substructure and different trough/peak timing and magnitudes, and their STFTs show different relative energy distribution across low-mid frequency rows. These contrasts further support excluding label 3 here.\\n\\nSimilarity scoring consistency check (per-label qualitative scores used in reasoning):\\n- label 0: 4 (high similarity) \u2014 near one-to-one match with feature summary and the 4 reference samples.\\n- label 1: 2\u20133 (low-to-moderate similarity) \u2014 shares low-frequency mid-cycle traits but lacks the exact mid-focused asymmetry label 1 emphasizes; I judge low-to-moderate but not the best match.\\n- label 2: 2 (low similarity) \u2014 some multi-lobe trough/peak behavior overlaps, but timing/amplitude ordering differs from label-2 prototypical windows.\\n- label 3: 1\u20132 (no-to-low similarity) \u2014 dissimilar mid-frequency irregularities and different trough timing in label-3 references; test sample matches label-0 instead.\\n- labels 4\u20136: 2 (low similarity) \u2014 share low-frequency bulges but differ in which hump/trough is dominant and in asymmetry patterns.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification: The test sample's exact sequence of (1) large positive start and steep early descent to a broad trough around t\u224825, (2) a smooth low-volatility mid rise, (3) a strong central peak near t\u224870, (4) a late trough and (5) a pronounced terminal rise is the canonical pattern described under label 0. The STFT corroborates that the informative components are concentrated in the very-low-frequency bands at those same time windows. The visual match to the four provided label-0 references is very close. Therefore the correct classification is label 0 with high similarity (score = 4).\"\n  ]\n}"

This mid-to-late region shows an asymmetric slow rise then faster fall. Volatility: low during ramp; modest mid-frequency content appears during the faster fall. STFT: strong lowest-frequency energy during the rise/peak, weaker mid-frequency content during the sharper descent.\\n- t = 81\u2013105: A small rebound/hump near t\u224892 (~+0.4\u2013+0.6) followed by a prolonged decline into a late trough.

As a whole the series encodes large-scale contour/shape segments that assemble into a characteristic multi-lobe signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to provided label feature summaries and candidate selection:\\n- Comparison to label_0 (Mirage): Strong match. Label_0 descriptions emphasize concentrated positive SHAP at very-low frequencies in windows around an early-to-mid trough \u2192 smooth slow rise (approx t\u224826\u201365), plus prominent mid/late peaks and a final broad rise. The sample exhibits the same set of slow, low-volatility lobes at matching time ranges and amplitudes (early high \u2192 trough near 25 \u2192 smooth mid rise \u2192 central peak near ~70 \u2192 late trough \u2192 final strong rise). STFT pattern also matches (lowest-frequency energy concentrated at those windows). Visual comparison to the provided similar reference samples (samples 41, 55, 37, 82 labeled 0) shows near-identical shape, timing of extrema and STFT low-frequency patterns.\\n- Comparison to other labels:\\n  * label_1 (Eurofighter): also emphasizes a strong mid window hump, but Eurofighter reference downplays the early pattern and often has different attribution to terminal rise.

Visual and spectral congruence is high.\\n- The two dissimilar references (samples 79 and 39, label 3) show more scattered mid-frequency texture and different arrangement/amplitude of troughs/peaks; they are visibly different in both waveform detail and STFT distribution.\\n- Given the near one-to-one match in (a) temporal ordering of major extrema, (b) amplitudes of key peaks/troughs, (c) low-frequency concentration in STFT at the same windows, and (d) extremely close visual similarity to multiple label-0 reference samples, I assign the highest similarity score (4 = High similarity) to label 0.

Volatility low (smooth monotonic descent, no high-frequency jitter). STFT: low-frequency energy present at the left edge.\\n- t = 16\u201330: reaches and holds a deep trough around t\u224820\u201328 (min \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6). This trough is broad (~8\u201312 steps), smooth and low-volatility, with small low-amplitude wiggles (\u00b10.1\u20130.2). STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during this trough.\\n- t = 31\u201355: smooth recovery and first mid positive hump: rises through zero and peaks near t\u224848\u201352 (peak \u2248 +0.6 to +0.8). The rise is gradual (low-frequency), volatility remains low. STFT: low-frequency band energy increases across the rise and peak.\\n- t = 56\u201380: a larger mid-late positive bulge: a second, stronger rise reaches a more pronounced peak near t\u224870 (peak \u2248 +1.5 to +1.8) with a subsequent fairly rapid fall toward a negative region by ~t\u224886\u201390. The ascent is smoother and slower than the descent (asymmetry). STFT: strong low-frequency energy aligned with the bulge; mid-frequency bands show little power.\\n- t = 81\u2013105: after the large bulge the series goes down into another negative region (moderate trough near -0.6 to -1.0 around t\u224896\u2013110) with some small higher-frequency ripples but overall low-frequency dominance. STFT: lower energy but still concentrated at bottom frequencies; some small mid-frequency contributions during steeper transitions.\\n- t = 106\u2013130: further descent to a trough around t\u2248114\u2013120 (min \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6), fairly broad and smooth; volatility low inside trough, steeper slopes on transitions.

STFT: renewed strong low-frequency content at the sequence end.\\n\\nStep 1 frequency summary: Across those windows the STFT heatmap shows the dominant magnitude concentrated in the very-low-frequency rows (near 0 Hz) at the same time intervals where the large-scale rises/troughs occur (especially early, mid, and end). Higher-frequency rows are weak and only modestly active during the steeper transitions.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features, temporal dependence and combination relationships:\\n- Global trend & periodicity: The sample is dominated by multiple large-scale, low-frequency undulations (roughly 2\u20133 slow cycles across 144 points): (1) an early high \u2192 deep trough, (2) a mid-section with two positive lobes (one moderate, one larger), (3) a late trough and a strong final rise. This creates a quasi-periodic low-frequency envelope rather than noise or high-frequency oscillations.\\n- Volatility: Low within broad lobes (smooth ramps), higher only during relatively brief steeper transitions (mid-to-late descent and the final rise\u2019s onset). High-frequency jitter is minimal and low-power according to STFT.\\n- Asymmetry & temporal ordering: Rises tend to be smoother/slower and falls can be somewhat steeper (notably the fall after the main mid bulge). The order of features (initial high \u2192 deep early trough \u2192 mid small hump \u2192 larger mid bulge \u2192 trough(s) \u2192 strong terminal rise) is consistent and likely important for classification.\\n- Combination: The classifier is likely using the presence, timing and amplitude of the broad low-frequency lobes and their relative ordering (phase) as discriminative cues. The STFT corroborates that these are primarily very-low-frequency events.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match against provided label feature summaries and selection:\\n- Compare to label_0 (Mirage): The label_0 description emphasizes strong positive low-frequency attribution at early, mid, and end windows; an early high followed by a deep trough around t~25; a smooth mid-window rise around t~26\u201365 and a larger mid peak around t~70\u201384; and a strong final rise. That matches this sample closely: the timings (early trough near 20\u201330, mid positive lobes around 48 and ~70, and large terminal rise) and the dominance of low-frequency energy align tightly with label_0\u2019s pattern.\\n- Compare to other labels: Label_1 (Eurofighter), label_2 (F-14 closed), label_4 (Harrier), label_5 (F-22), and label_6 (F-15) all emphasize low-frequency components too, but their characteristic ordering, asymmetries and specific time-locations differ. In particular the combination of an early large drop to a trough near ~25, a mid smaller hump then a larger hump near ~70, followed by a deep trough and a steep final rise is directly described in label_0\u2019s feature/pattern list. The four provided similar reference samples (samples labeled 0) are almost visually identical to the test sample (same extrema at same times, nearly identical envelope and STFT low-frequency concentration). Dissimilar samples (label 3) show repeated higher-amplitude negative lobes and different mid-sequence microstructure and STFT pattern.\\n- Therefore the best match is label 0 (Mirage). I assign highest similarity score 4 (high similarity) because multiple explicit points in the label_0 description map nearly point-for-point to this test sample (timing of troughs/peaks, low-frequency dominance, asymmetric slopes, and final strong rise).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four similar reference samples (labels 41, 55, 37, 82 \u2014 all label 0) show the same shape: very similar early high and descent into trough around t\u224820\u201330, mid two-stage bulges (a smaller hump then a larger hump near t\u224870), a late trough around t\u2248110\u2013120, and a large terminal rise. Their STFT images concentrate power in the same bottom frequency rows and have similar time\u2013frequency localization. The test sample 86 is essentially the same waveform with only tiny pointwise differences. This confirms the choice is consistent and robust.\\n- The two dissimilar samples shown (labels 3) have different mid-sequence microstructure (more intermediate local peaks, different trough depths and placements) and stronger mid-frequency energy in STFT across different times; they do not match the test sample\u2019s clear two-/three-lobe low-frequency envelope and timing.\\n- Scoring fairness: Given nearly identical waveform shapes and matching STFT patterns between sample 86 and the label_0 reference set and label_0 feature summary, a score of 4 (high similarity) is appropriate. Other labels show at most partial overlap (low-frequency emphasis) but lack the specific temporal ordering and amplitudes present here, so they receive lower similarity implicitly (not listed numerically here per output spec).\\n\\nFinal classification: label 0 (Mirage) with similarity score 4. The decision is supported by precise alignment in timing and amplitude of early trough (~t=20\u201330), mid small hump (~t\u224848\u201352) and larger mid bulge (~t\u224870), low-frequency dominance in STFT at those times, and the steep smooth terminal rise \u2014 all hallmark features in the label_0 description and the provided label-0 reference samples.\"\n    ]\n}"

Faster transitions (where present) introduce slight mid-frequency energy but do not dominate.\\n- Combination: The classifier-like evidence would come from the timing and amplitude of these broad lobes (their relative positions: early high + trough + mid hump + main hump + final rise) rather than from small high-frequency details.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries (coarse mapping):\\n- Label 0 (Mirage): The label_0 description emphasizes an early high positive baseline, a deep trough around t\u224825 followed by a slow, sustained rise in the mid-window and another central peak, plus a strong final broad rise\u2014exactly the multi-lobe pattern observed here. STFT/SHAP descriptions for label_0 highlight low-frequency dominance in windows that align well with the test sample. Visual comparison to the provided similar reference samples (samples 16, 55, 37, 100) shows near one-to-one correspondence in waveform shape, timing of extrema, amplitude ranges, and STFT low-frequency concentration.\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): Also characterized by a dominant mid-segment low-frequency asymmetric cycle (\u224839\u201395). The test sample does contain this mid-cycle, so it is partially consistent with label_1. However label_1 descriptions downplay the importance of the very early high baseline and the very strong final rise, both of which are prominent and diagnostic in our sample and are emphasized by label_0.\\n- Other labels (2,3,4,5,6): While several classes also show low-frequency structure, their characteristic patterns differ in timing, asymmetry and the number/placement of major troughs/peaks (e.g., label_3 exhibits different mid-sequence shapes and more negative mid troughs; label_4 emphasizes a single dominant mid bump at a different alignment). The test sample does not match those templates as closely as it matches label_0 reference patterns.\\n\\nConclusion of Step 3: label_0 (Mirage) has the highest matching degree. I assign a high similarity score.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with the provided reference samples and fairness of scoring:\\n- The four \\\"similar\\\" reference plots (samples 16, 55, 37, 100) are all labeled 0 in the provided references and are visually almost identical to Test sample 88 in terms of: early large positive start, trough near t\u224820\u201330, moderate hump near 45, strong hump near 70\u201375, trough around 100\u2013115 and final large rise to the end. Their STFT images likewise show concentrated power at the lowest frequency bins in the same time ranges. This strong concordance supports choosing label_0 and a top score.\\n- The two \\\"dissimilar\\\" references (labels 3) show different mid-sequence morphology and more varied mid/high-frequency content; they are therefore good negative checks and help validate that the test series aligns with label_0 rather than label_3.\\n- The scoring logic: because both the waveform shape (timing and amplitude of major lobes) and the time-frequency signatures match the label_0 summaries and reference samples very closely, a score of 4 (high similarity) is fair and consistent.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 (Mirage) with similarity score 4. The classification is based on the highly matching sequence of broad, low-frequency lobes (early positive \u2192 trough near 25 \u2192 mid hump(s) including a strong hump at \u224870 \u2192 trough \u2192 final broad rise) and matching STFT low-frequency concentration that aligns closely with the label_0 template and reference examples.\"\n  ]\n}",

STFT: some low-frequency energy at the very start but not the dominant discriminative window.\\n\\n- t = 13\u201330: continued descent into a deep trough.

The ascent into this peak is smoother and more extended than the descent that follows. Shape/substructure: there is a two-stage mid-structure (earlier smaller hump then a larger hump); asymmetry: rise is gentler than the subsequent fall. Volatility: low during rise, slightly higher during the descent. STFT: very strong power in the lowest frequency bins aligned with this interval.\\n\\n- t = 76\u201395: relatively fast decline after the main mid-peak into a trough near t\u224886\u201392 (amplitude ~-1.0 to -1.3), with a small rebound around t\u224894\u201396 (amplitude ~+0.3 to +0.5).

Higher-frequency rows are low-power across the series and contribute little; there is some increased mid-frequency presence during the steeper mid-window descent (t\u224876\u201390), consistent with sharper transitions there.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall sample-level characteristics and temporal dependence:\\n- Dominant character: the trace is dominated by broad, low-frequency undulations (3 main broad lobes/troughs across the 144 points): an early fall into a trough, a mid double-bulge with a larger central peak, and a late trough followed by a strong final rise. Energy concentration in STFT confirms the classifier-relevant structure is at very low frequencies.\\n- Periodicity/shape: quasi-periodic at a low fundamental frequency \u2014 the sequence shows multiple separated, smooth convex/concave segments rather than high-frequency oscillations.\\n- Volatility pattern: low volatility inside broad lobes (smooth ramps), moderate volatility during transition intervals (notably the mid-peak descent). The mid-segment shows an asymmetric cycle (gentle rise into a big bulge, faster fall), which is a distinctive temporal dynamic.\\n- Temporal dependency: order and relative timing matter \u2014 a zero crossing around t\u224838\u201340 precedes the small hump and then the main mid-peak; the two-stage mid hump (smaller then larger) and the quick fall thereafter appear in a consistent sequence that serves as a discriminative signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries (quick comparison):\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): summary emphasizes a strong low-frequency mid-window between ~39\u201395 with a smaller hump then a larger hump around ~72\u201378, asymmetric slower rise and faster fall, and STFT energy concentrated at low frequencies in that mid-window. This description matches the test sample very closely (mid double-hump at ~48 and ~72, faster fall to trough ~86, low-frequency dominance). => Similarity: 4/4.\\n- Label 0 (Mirage): summary emphasizes low-frequency energy and slow undulations (peaks/troughs across the series) and positive attribution at windows like t~13\u201330, 48\u201356, 64\u201392 \u2014 many elements overlap with our sample. The test sample shares those low-frequency multi-lobe traits and endpoint rises, so similarity is also high but the label-1 specific asymmetry and the particular mid-window double-hump pattern are more strongly characteristic of label 1. => Similarity: 3/4.\\n- Label 2,3,4,5,6 (other classes): each emphasizes particular timing/shape differences (for example label 2 has different trough timing; label 3 has different arrangement of lobes; label 4 centers on a single very large mid hump of different timing; label 5 and 6 have other mid-lobe magnitudes/locations). Compared to the precise mid-window double-hump + asymmetric fall of this sample, these other labels show lower agreement. => Similarity estimates: label 2: 2/4, label 3: 1/4, label 4: 2/4, label 5: 2/4, label 6: 2/4.\\n\\nConclusion of Step 3: label 1 has the highest match (4/4).

However those specific references are annotated with label 0.0 in the retrieval, which indicates ambiguity in the retrieval system or that labels 0 and 1 have very close waveform prototypes in the dataset. I re-examined distinguishing details: the defining detail for label 1 in the feature summaries is the pronounced mid-window two-stage hump (small then larger) between ~39\u201395 with a faster decline afterwards. The test sample shows that pattern clearly. The label-0 summaries also match many broad features but emphasize slightly different attribution windows and sometimes a stronger importance of an early positive lobe at t\u22480 and final rise; those are present for both labels here, making them less discriminative.\\n- Dissimilar references (samples 79 and 1 labeled 3.0) show more mid-sequence higher-frequency microstructure and different trough/peak placement \u2014 they diverge visibly from the test sample, confirming our sample is not from label 3.\\n- After re-checking timing, asymmetry, STFT low-frequency concentration and comparing with the canonical descriptions, the selection of label 1 is consistent and defensible. The similarity scoring above (label 1 = 4) is fair given the near-exact match to the label-1 descriptive signature; label 0 receives a slightly lower score (3) because many features overlap but the prototypical mid-window asymmetry and hump ordering are better described under label 1.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 1 (Eurofighter).

STFT: strong energy concentrated at the lowest frequency rows (very low-frequency / DC-like content) in this time block.\\n- t = 30\u201344: Recovery / moderate hump.

STFT: low-frequency energy increases during the rise.\\n- t = 44\u201360: Small decline then shallow negative excursion. A modest fall from the small hump down toward slightly negative values around t\u224856. Substructure: small higher-frequency ripples of low amplitude superimposed but low power in STFT.\\n- t = 60\u201380: Large, dominant positive bulge. A smooth, strong rise to the largest interior peak (~+1.5 to +1.8 around t\u224870\u201376) followed by a fall. Shape: broad, low-frequency convex peak; rise is smoother/longer than subsequent fall (asymmetry). STFT: concentrated at the lowest frequency bins in this interval (bright low-freq band).\\n- t = 80\u2013100: Fast-to-moderate descent into a trough then small rebound. The fall from the major peak is faster than the preceding rise (steeper negative slope), reaching negative/near-zero values by ~t\u224888\u201394. Some modest mid-frequency content appears during the faster transition (small energy at mid rows in STFT), but low-frequency still dominates most of the window.\\n- t = 100\u2013125: Secondary trough and variable region. The series reaches another trough (\u2248 -1.2 to -1.4 around 110\u2013116) with low-volatility interior but slightly more small-scale wiggles than earlier troughs. STFT: low-frequency energy concentrated but small mid-frequency traces from transitions.\\n- t = 125\u2013143: Strong terminal rise to high positive endpoint. A smooth, relatively rapid ascent from trough up to ~+2.4 at the end (largest endpoint), average slope moderately high (~+0.15 to +0.18 units/step).

Higher-frequency bands show only weak power and are mostly aligned with the rapid transitional slopes where SHAP-like analyses would downweight them.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal dependence:\\n- Dominant characteristics: the trace is dominated by a small number (2\u20133) of broad low-frequency undulations (large early drop, mid large positive bulge, late deep trough then final strong rise). Energy and importance concentrate at very-low frequencies \u2014 i.e., global contour-scale features rather than high-frequency detail.\\n- Periodicity and ordering: quasi-periodic low-frequency cycles spaced roughly every 30\u201340 time steps (troughs and peaks). The order of events is consistent: initial high \u2192 deep early trough \u2192 moderate hump \u2192 large central peak \u2192 trough \u2192 final rise. The classifier would likely use the timing/ordering and relative amplitudes of these broad lobes as a signature.\\n- Volatility: low inside broad lobes; greater during transitions (especially the fall after the central peak and the final rise\u2019s onset). High-frequency noise is minimal and localized; most STFT energy remains at the bottom bins.\\n- Asymmetry: rises are generally smoother/longer than some of the subsequent falls (notable in the central hump), matching the asymmetric rise/fast-fall pattern seen in some training examples.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison to label feature summaries and selection of best-matching label:\\n- Label 0 (Mirage) summary highlights: strong positive low-frequency attribution concentrated in middle windows (~26\u201365 in provided example), broad trough\u2192slow rise\u2192broad peaks, low volatility within these broad events, and final large positive terminal rise. The test sample matches these: early high then deep trough, strong smooth mid/late bulges, low-frequency dominance in STFT, and a large final ascent. Temporal ordering and amplitude pattern (early descent \u2192 mid slow rise \u2192 large central peak \u2192 late trough \u2192 strong terminal rise) align closely with the provided label 0 pattern.\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): emphasizes a dominant asymmetric mid-window cycle (39\u201395) and less emphasis on terminal rise. Our sample shares mid-window low-frequency hump but also has a strong final rise and early trough pattern that label 1 descriptions downplayed; overall similarity is lower than label 0.\\n- Label 2/3/4/5/6: all emphasize low-frequency events but differ in timing, number, and relative signs of peaks/troughs. Several labels (e.g., 2 and 3) have multiple troughs/humps, but the specific placement and amplitudes in our sample best match the label 0 archetype (notably the early trough at ~25, mid slow rise, central broad peak, and large final rise which were explicitly called out for label 0).\\n- Therefore the highest matching degree is label 0 (Mirage). I assign similarity scores (interpretive, for cross-check): label 0 = 4 (high), label 1 = 3 (moderate), label 2 = 3 (moderate), label 3 = 2 (low-moderate), label 4 = 2 (low-moderate), label 5 = 2 (low-moderate), label 6 = 2 (low-moderate). Final pick: label 0 with highest match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples:\\n- The four provided similar reference samples are all labeled 0 and their time-series plots and STFTs are visually nearly identical to sample 92: same initial high then drop, same mid modest hump then larger central peak near t\u224870, similar trough around t\u2248110 and large terminal rise. The STFTs for those references also show strong energy concentrated at the lowest frequency rows during the matching windows. This close visual and spectral match supports a high similarity rating (4) to label 0.\\n- The two dissimilar reference samples (labels 3.0) show more pronounced mid-sequence higher-frequency texture (multiple smaller oscillations around mid-late times) and different amplitude placements; these do not align well with sample 92\u2019s smoother set of broad lobes. This reinforces that label 3 is a poor match.\\n- Fairness and consistency check: the scoring logic favors label summaries that explicitly mention features present in the test sample (low-frequency dominance, specific timing of troughs and peaks, and final large rise). The reference label-0 examples and the label_0 feature description include the same combination of events present in sample 92, so assigning the highest similarity (4) to label 0 is consistent and justified.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 (Mirage), similarity score = 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

Volatility: low within the ramp.\\n- Frequency summary from STFT: energy is concentrated in the lowest-frequency bins across the major events (start, mid bulge, late troughs, final rise). Higher-frequency bins show very little power overall and no strong localized high-frequency bursts.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features, temporal dependencies and combinations:\\n- Dominant characteristics: the trace is dominated by large-scale, low-frequency lobes (early high, early trough, mid hump, later trough, final rise). The pattern is quasi-periodic with roughly 2\u20133 slow undulations across 144 points. Volatility is low within those lobes; sharper transitions are relatively rare and modest in amplitude.\\n- Temporal dependency: the discriminative features are their timing and ordering \u2014 the early positive \u2192 deep early trough \u2192 smooth mid rise/peak \u2192 descent \u2192 late deep trough \u2192 final rise. The mid bulge (~65\u201375) is a strong anchor; the final rising edge is another anchor. These broad events combine additively to form the overall signature.\\n- Frequency behavior: STFT confirms that the relevant structure is low-frequency (very bright bottom row during key windows). There is minimal mid/high-frequency power, consistent with smooth contour-like shapes rather than jagged detail.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to provided label feature summaries (does sample pattern appear in label_0 summary?):\\n- Label 0 (Mirage) summary emphasizes: strong low-frequency attribution concentrated near several windows including an early descent to a deep trough (~t\u224825), a sustained mid-window slow rise (~26\u201365), a large central broad peak (~64\u201392), and a final strong low-frequency terminal rise. The sample's events match these: early high then deep trough near 18\u201330; a smooth mid rise and a pronounced mid/late peak around 65\u201375; a later trough near 105\u2013116; and a final strong rise to the endpoint. STFT low-frequency concentration also matches. Conclusion: high agreement. (Similarity score = 4)\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): also low-frequency mid-segment hump is important, but label_1 places the strongest discriminative weight on a specific asymmetric mid-cycle and de-emphasizes early/late extremes. Our sample includes early and final large positive lobes that label_1 often discounts, and the mid-structure here matches label_0\u2019s described three-lobe pattern more closely. (Similarity score = 2\u20133; more likely 2 because early/final lobes are strongly present and are important for label_0.)\\n- Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): label_2 shows early steep fall and three main low-frequency blocks (early trough, mid hump, late trough + final rise). That is similar in structure, but the numerical shapes/relative amplitudes in the label_2 description emphasize different timing and relative strengths (and training examples show different mid-late hump placements). Given the strong match to label_0 reference samples, label_2 is moderately similar but not as good as label_0. (Similarity score = 3)\\n- Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): label_3 examples have multiple separated negative lobes and some faster, larger slope swings; also their STFT pattern shows more negative trough emphasis and more abrupt pulses. The test sample is smoother and its mid/late positive bulges weigh toward label_0. (Similarity score = 1\u20132; choose 2 low similarity.)\\n- Label 4 (Harrier), label 5 (F-22), label 6 (F-15): these labels emphasize a dominant single central hump (Harrier), asymmetric mid-lobe patterns (F-22) or a persistent low-frequency envelope with some penalized mid-frequency bursts (F-15). Our sample contains multiple low-frequency lobes with clear early and final extremes matching the label_0 prototype and the provided reference label_0 examples. Therefore similarity to labels 4/5/6 is low to moderate. (Similarity scores: label_4 = 2, label_5 = 2, label_6 = 2.)\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples and final decision:\\n- The four similar reference plots (samples 83, 16, 26, 7) are all labeled 0 and are visually near-identical to test sample 93: identical early high, early deep trough about t\u224820, moderate hump around t\u224840\u201350, pronounced mid peak near t\u224868\u201374, later trough near t\u2248110, and final strong rise to endpoint. Their STFTs also show the same bottom-row dominance in the same time windows. These direct training examples strongly validate mapping to label 0.\\n- The two dissimilar examples (labels 3.0) show more negative-dominant central behavior and more frequent intermediate oscillations; their STFTs show relatively different time-frequency fingerprints (more mid-frequency content in places). These differ clearly from sample 93.\\n- Considering the feature-level agreement (timing of troughs/peaks, amplitude envelope, low-frequency dominance, low volatility within lobes, and ordering of events), the best match is label 0 (Mirage). The match is very close to the provided label_0 reference samples, so I assign the maximum similarity confidence.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 0 (Mirage).

This is a smooth, low-volatility downward ramp with an average slope on the order of -0.14 to -0.20 units/step across ~20 steps. STFT shows elevated energy confined to the lowest frequency bins here, confirming the event is a broad, slow change (not high-frequency noise). SHAP attributes this entire low-frequency descent strongly positively \u2014 i.e., the model treats this long, smooth descent/trough as evidence for the predicted class.\",\n    \"   - Mid block (\u2248 t=48\u201378, especially 64\u201392): The series climbs from negative around t\u224840 up through a modest hump near t\u224850 (\u2248 +0.6) then to a larger mid/late peak around t\u224872\u201378 (\u2248 +1.6 to +1.8), followed by a decline toward ~t\u224890. These rises/falls are smooth (low local volatility) and have dominant low-frequency content in the STFT.

Small higher-frequency wiggles exist around troughs but STFT energy and SHAP attribution show they are low-power and either neutral or slightly negative for the class.\",\n    \"4) Shape/substructure: The sample contains 2\u20133 broad low-frequency lobes (early large descent to trough, mid sequence double-bump culminating in a main peak ~75, later trough + terminal rise).

The energy in STFT is concentrated at the lowest frequency band during the major events, confirming the slow envelope is dominant.\",\n    \"- Volatility: Low inside broad lobes and higher only during the sharper transitions (but those higher-frequency components have low power and negative/neutral SHAP). Overall volatility is low-to-moderate, dominated by smooth ramps.\",\n    \"- Temporal dependence & combination: The classifier\u2019s SHAP map shows additive positive contributions when multiple low-frequency lobes occur at the expected time windows (early trough + mid bulge + terminal rise). The relative ordering (initial positive baseline -> deep early trough -> slow mid rise -> larger mid peak -> later trough -> final rise) matches a temporally-ordered signature that the model treats as a coherent pattern.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and selection of highest-matching label:\",\n    \"- Compare to label summaries: The described features match label 0 (Mirage) very closely.

Their STFTs also concentrate energy at the lowest frequency rows in the same time windows and their SHAP heatmaps emphasize those same low-frequency windows. Sample 96 matches these four references in timing, amplitude ranges of peaks and troughs, smoothness (low volatility in lobes), and STFT low-frequency concentration.\",\n    \"- Dissimilar samples 89 and 46 (label 3) show different mid-sequence structure: stronger local oscillations/higher-frequency clusters in 60\u201395 range and more pronounced negative troughs at other positions; their SHAP maps sometimes show different activation patterns (including some positive at other freq/time combinations). Sample 96 does not exhibit these features and instead follows the label-0 template.\",\n    \"- Fairness and scoring logic: Given near one-to-one correspondence between the major discriminative events (early trough at ~25, mid bulge and peak near ~72\u201378, final endpoint rise), the same low-frequency STFT support, and matching SHAP localization to the lowest-frequency rows in exactly the windows emphasized by label 0 summaries and reference samples, the similarity is high. I therefore rate similarity to label 0 = 4 (High similarity). For other labels the match is substantially lower (they lack the same combination of timing, amplitude, and low-frequency emphasis), so label 0 remains the chosen classification.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Final conclusion: Sample 96 is classified as label 0 (Mirage) with high confidence based on (1) early large smooth descent to trough (~t13\u201339) strongly positively attributed; (2) a low-volatility mid-sequence slow rise to a pronounced peak (~t64\u201392) also positively attributed; (3) STFT confirming most discriminative energy is in the lowest frequency bins at those same times; and (4) close visual/spectral agreement with multiple provided label-0 reference examples.\"\n  ]\n}"

Volatility: low within the ramp; STFT shows low-frequency energy returning in the last window. Interpretation: a large-scale positive final bulge.\\n\\nSummary of local features: the sequence is dominated by several broad low-frequency lobes: an early positive bulge, an early deep trough, a mid hump, a larger mid-late peak, a deep late trough and a strong final rise. Within transitions there are some faster descents/rises where mid-frequency energy is visible in the STFT, but most discriminative signal is concentrated in the lowest frequency rows throughout the highlighted windows.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features, periodicity and temporal dependency:\\n- Trend & global shape: quasi-periodic low-frequency envelope composed of ~2\u20133 large-scale undulations across 144 points (positive lobe \u2192 deep trough \u2192 mid hump \u2192 large peak \u2192 trough \u2192 final rise). There is no stationary mean; large swings between \u2248 -1.6 and +2.5.\\n- Frequency content: STFT shows most energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bands during the major events (early, mid, late). Mid-frequency bands become visible only during the sharper descents/ascents (notably the descent after the big mid-late peak). High-frequency energy is minimal and corresponds to localized texture rather than primary structure.\\n- Volatility: generally low during broad lobes (smooth ramps). Higher instantaneous slopes (greater volatility) occur on a few transitions (fall after the large peak, final climb is brisk) and correspond to modest mid-frequency energy.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: the discriminative pattern is the ordered sequence of broad curvature events \u2014 the early high \u2192 early trough \u2192 mid hump \u2192 larger mid-late peak \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise \u2014 i.e., both timing and relative amplitudes of these low-frequency lobes matter. The sample\u2019s major events are separated by tens of time steps, consistent with long-period shape components. The classifier would rely on these ordered, phase-linked broad events rather than on small-scale jitter.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature summaries and selection of best label:\\n- Comparing to label_0 (Mirage): The label_0 description emphasizes: (a) strong positive start, (b) a rapid descent into a trough around t\u224825 followed by a smooth slow rise from ~26\u201365, (c) another larger positive peak near t\u224870\u201380, (d) later trough around ~110 and a final broad rise to a high endpoint. SHAP/STFT description for label_0 also stresses dominant energy in the lowest-frequency band during these windows and that mid/high-frequency content is penalized. The test sample 97 matches these points closely: early high, trough at \u224825, steady mid rise to a mid hump, a larger peak at \u224875\u201378, a late trough \u2248110\u2013120, and a strong terminal rise. STFT also shows low-frequency energy in the corresponding windows. This is a very high degree of match.\\n- Comparing to label_1 (Eurofighter): label_1 focuses on a dominant low-frequency asymmetric mid-cycle centered roughly 39\u201395 with a two-hump structure and an emphasis on mid-window asymmetry. Sample 97 does have mid-window lobes, but the precise mid-window pattern and the relative weighting of early/late events more closely follow label_0's multi-lobe timeline rather than label_1's described mid-window anchor only. Moderate but weaker match.\\n- Comparing to label_2 (F-14 wings closed) and label_3 (F-14 wings opened): both include multi-stage low-frequency troughs/peaks, but label_3\u2019s distinguishing patterns include different spacing/timing of deep troughs and more frequent mid-frequency wiggles; the dissimilar reference samples (labels 3) show more in-between high-frequency oscillations. Sample 97\u2019s smooth rises and the particular timing of troughs and dual mid peaks align better with label_0 than with label_3. Low similarity to label_3.\\n- Comparing to labels 4\u20136 (Harrier, F-22, F-15): each has a characteristic single dominant hump or different spacing/amplitude patterns. Sample 97\u2019s combination of early high, trough near 25, mid humps and strong late rise best matches the composite multi-lobe Mirage signature rather than the single dominant mid hump of Harrier or F-22 or the particular envelope of F-15.\\n\\nConclusion of Step 3: label 0 (Mirage) is the best-fitting label. I assign highest similarity to label_0.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples and final scoring justification:\\n- The four provided 'similar' reference samples are all labeled 0 and their plots and STFTs are visually and quantitatively very close to sample 97: they show the same early high \u2192 trough around t\u224825 \u2192 mid hump near 50 \u2192 larger peak near 75\u201380 \u2192 trough near 110 \u2192 terminal rise. Their STFTs likewise concentrate energy in the lowest-frequency bins in the same time windows. This supports a very high match.\\n- The two provided 'dissimilar' samples (label 3) differ clearly: their mid region shows more intermediate oscillations and different arrangement of lobes; they have greater mid-frequency activity and different trough/peak spacing. Sample 97 does not show those distinguishing differences. This reinforces that label 3 is not a good fit.\\n- Scoring fairness and consistency: Given the near one-to-one correspondence between the sample\u2019s major low-frequency events and the label_0 pattern described in the summary (including timing, amplitude relationships, smoothness/low volatility within lobes, and STFT low-frequency concentration), the similarity is best rated at the top level (4 = High similarity). For other labels the match is noticeably weaker (2\u20133 or lower), so choosing label_0 with score 4 is consistent and justified by direct visual / spectral / temporal comparisons with both the summary descriptions and the concrete reference samples.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 0 (Mirage), similarity score = 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

The test sample does have a two-stage mid structure (smaller hump ~48, larger hump ~76) and a final rise, so there is moderate overlap. However label_1 puts more distinctive emphasis on the particular mid-hump asymmetry and tends to discount early large baseline declines; our sample's prominent early trough plus final strong rise are more characteristic of label 0's described signature.

Our sample has multiple significant lobes rather than just one single dominant mid hump in the exact form described for Harrier or F-22; the closest overall textual match remains label_0 because of the combination of early positive baseline, a deep early trough around 25, a distinct central major peak near ~76 and a strong final rise.

This trough is wide (sustained ~6\u201312 steps) and low-volatility (smooth). STFT: strong low-frequency power aligned to this trough.\\n- t = 30\u201350: Recovery and a modest positive hump. From ~t=30 the series rises through zero to a modest local positive peak around t\u224846\u201352 (\u2248 +0.6 to +1.0). Rise is smooth with moderate slope; small localized wiggles of low amplitude (~0.1\u20130.3) appear but STFT still dominated by lowest-frequency rows (low-frequency). This window contains a small hump substructure (gentle rise \u2192 small peak \u2192 small fall).\\n- t = 50\u201375: After the modest hump the signal falls briefly then undergoes a stronger, broad ascent culminating in the dominant mid/late major peak near t\u224870\u201376 (\u2248 +1.6 to +1.8). This primary peak has low local volatility and shows strong low-frequency STFT energy. The ascent into the large peak is somewhat more rapid than the preceding smaller hump; the subsequent descent is relatively steep (asymmetric rise/fall).\\n- t = 75\u201395: Fast decline from the major peak into a trough near ~t=85\u201392 (\u2248 -0.7 to -1.1), followed by a small positive rebound around ~t=94\u201398. The descent around ~75\u201385 shows more mid-frequency content than the broad rises (STFT shows slightly increased energy above the lowest row during the faster descent), but the dominant attribution is still in the lowest-frequency band.\\n- t = 95\u2013120: The middle-late segment drifts down further to a second deeper valley near t\u2248110\u2013118 (\u2248 -1.4 to -1.6), with moderate slope and somewhat increased local volatility relative to the broad low-frequency lobes.

High-frequency content is minimal and localized to steeper transitions where it is comparatively weak. Volatility is low inside the broad lobes and higher only during relatively fast descents/ascents.\\n- Periodicity & patterning: The trace shows a quasi-periodic sequence of large-scale undulations: initial high \u2192 deep early trough \u2192 modest mid hump \u2192 larger mid peak \u2192 mid trough \u2192 late trough \u2192 final large rise. There are 2\u20133 main low-frequency cycles across the 144 points (spacing between extrema on the order of ~30\u201350 steps). The temporal ordering is important: an early high and deep trough near t\u224825, then a modest hump near t\u224848\u201352 followed by a pronounced larger hump near t\u224870\u201376, then descent and final recovery. The small hump (around 48) preceding the larger hump (around 72) is a clear sequential substructure.\\n- Asymmetry: Rise/fall asymmetry is present in the mid-region: the growth into the major mid peak is somewhat brisk vs. a quicker fall afterwards. The classifier-type descriptions in the reference summaries emphasize that such asymmetry and the relative ordering of a smaller hump preceding a larger hump are discriminative.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and provisional label selection:\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter) summary: Key signature = strong low-frequency mid-segment activation between ~39\u201395, with a modest hump near ~48\u201355 and a dominant peak around ~72\u201378, asymmetric (slower rise then steeper fall), early high baseline and final rise present but not decisive. The test sample contains all of these: an early high and deep trough \u2248t=25, a modest hump \u2248t=46\u201352 and a larger peak \u2248t=70\u201376, followed by a relatively fast fall and later recovery.

Match = very high.\\n- Label 0 (Mirage): Emphasizes strong low-frequency blocks around ~13\u201330 and ~48\u201392, slow smooth rises and multiple large low-frequency lobes. The test shares low-frequency multi-lobe structure and final large rise, but the precise mid-segment anatomy (a smaller hump then a larger hump at ~72) described for label 1 is more characteristic of the sample. Match = moderate-high.\\n- Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): Also describes early descent to trough near 25, mid- and late-humps and a late trough ~100\u2013120 then final rise. Some commonalities exist (early trough and multiple lobes), but the distinctive two-stage mid hump (small then large peaking ~72) and timing match label 1 more closely. Match = low-moderate.\\n- Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): Characterized by a large early downward swing plus a deep trough near ~50 and other patterns; reference dissimilar samples show different mid-frequency texture and STFT energy patterns. Test sample STFT shows low-frequency dominance and the mid-lobe structure that aligns with label 1, so label 3 is not a good match. Match = low.\\n- Label 4 (Harrier): Dominant single big mid bump around t\u224852\u201371 is the primary cue. Our sample has a dominant mid peak around ~70 but also a preceding smaller hump and stronger multi-lobe structure; therefore it resembles Harrier in having a prominent mid positive bulge, but the ordered small-then-large hump pattern is more label-1-specific. Match = low-moderate.\\n- Label 5 (F-22): Has a broad positive hump in mid-sequence (~36\u201370) and endpoint amplitude high; some similarity exists in mid-lobe morphology but label-5 examples show different amplitude balance (primary mid hump smaller relative to endpoints) and fewer ordered small-then-large hump signatures. Match = low.\\n- Label 6 (F-15): Emphasizes a persistent very-low-frequency envelope across the middle with twin peaks near ~65 and ~78 and penalizes abrupt mid-frequency spikes. Our sample does show twin-like peaks and low-frequency envelope, so there is some similarity, but the distinctive smaller hump preceding the larger 72 peak and other timing cues align better to label 1. Match = low-moderate.\\n\\nProvisional decision: Label 1 (Eurofighter) has the strongest and most specific match in timing, amplitude pattern and STFT low-frequency attribution (small hump \u224850 then main peak \u224872, early high, final rise) so it is selected.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- Visual comparison to the four provided 'similar' references (all labelled 1): The test trace overlays very closely in macro-structure with samples 27, 33, 36, 103: same early high \u2192 descent to trough near 20\u201330 \u2192 modest hump near 45\u201352 \u2192 dominant peak near ~70\u201376 \u2192 fall into trough near 85\u201395 \u2192 late trough and final strong rise to endpoint. The STFTs are also near-identical: strongest energy in the lowest-frequency rows during the same mid windows and little high-frequency activity. This is a strong visual and spectral concordance, supporting label 1 with high confidence.\\n- Contrast with the two 'dissimilar' references (both labelled 3): Those traces show different mid-sequence texture (more irregular mid-segment oscillations or different placement of dominant humps) and their STFTs show different mid-frequency patterns. The test sample does not share those mid-frequency signatures, reinforcing that label 3 is unlikely.\\n- Scoring logic and fairness: Given near one-to-one alignment of key, discriminative, time-locked low-frequency features (timing and amplitude of the small mid hump then large mid peak, plus early high and final rise) with the label-1 references and label-1 summary, assignment of the highest similarity score (4) to label 1 is consistent and fair. Other labels share some generic low-frequency multi-lobe traits but lack the precise ordered small-then-large mid hump and asymmetry; therefore they receive lower similarity scores.\\n\\nFinal similarity scores (1\u20134) assigned after cross-checking:\\n- label_0: 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 shares low-frequency multi-lobe structure but not the same mid-segment hump ordering)\\n- label_1: 4 (high similarity \u2014 near-complete match in temporal placement, amplitude, asymmetry and STFT signature; matches provided reference plots closely)\\n- label_2: 2 (low similarity \u2014 some shared trough/hump patterns but less alignment in timing and relative amplitudes)\\n- label_3: 1 (no/very low similarity \u2014 mid-frequency texture and spectral signature differ; dissimilar references confirm)\\n- label_4: 2 (low similarity \u2014 single dominant mid bump idea overlaps, but the sample shows a two-stage mid structure unusual for label 4)\\n- label_5: 2 (low similarity \u2014 some broad mid-lobe resemblance but different amplitude balance and substructure)\\n- label_6: 2 (low similarity \u2014 general low-frequency envelope present but not the characteristic penalized mid-frequency transitions and timing of label 6)\\n\\nConclusion: After careful windowed feature extraction, STFT-informed frequency analysis, direct comparison to the provided reference plots and feature summaries, and verification against dissimilar examples, the most accurate classification is label 1 (Eurofighter). The similarity score for label 1 is 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

The trace begins near +2.5 and falls steadily to about 0 by ~t=13. Change rate: fairly steep negative slope early (average ~-0.15 to -0.2 units/step). Volatility: low (smooth monotonic descent). STFT: low-frequency energy present at the left edge (bottom rows). Interpretation: a large-scale leading positive bulge that the model would treat as a coarse/low-frequency feature.\\n- t = 16\u201330: Deep early trough. The series continues down to a minimum near t\u224824\u201328 around ~-1.6 to -1.7. Shape: wide, smooth valley (low volatility within trough). STFT: continued low-frequency power. Implication: a broad negative lobe that is a discriminative slow feature.\\n- t = 31\u201350: Recovery and modest positive hump. The signal rises smoothly from the trough and forms a moderate positive hump around t\u224848\u201352 with peak amplitude \u2248+0.6 to +1.0. Change rate: moderate positive slope during the rise; volatility remains low. STFT: increased energy in the lowest frequency bin during this interval. Substructure: small local wiggles at the hump peak but low magnitude.\\n- t = 51\u201370: Descent into intermediate trough then rise. After the moderate hump the series drops again to slight negative values (~-0.6 to -0.8) and then begins another ascent. Shape: low-frequency oscillatory behavior; STFT shows low-frequency concentration across this mid-block.\\n- t = 71\u201385: Prominent main mid-peak and fast fall. There is a pronounced positive peak centered ~t=75\u201378 with amplitude \u2248+1.6\u20131.8, followed by a relatively steep decline to negative values by ~t=86\u201392. Change-rate asymmetry: slower rise into the main peak than the subsequent fall (rise is moderate, fall is steeper). STFT: strong low-frequency energy aligned with the mid-peak; higher frequency content is weak. This mid-window is the strongest low-frequency feature.\\n- t = 86\u2013105: Rapid decline into mid-late trough and small rebounds. The series goes negative (\u2248 -0.9 to -1.2) with some small faster oscillations superimposed (slightly increased mid-frequency content but low magnitude). STFT: dominant energy still in lowest band across the region; some modest power at slightly higher bins during the steeper transitions.\\n- t = 106\u2013125: Extended negative valley then recovery start. The trace reaches another trough (~-1.2 to -1.5 around t\u2248115) and then begins to recover. Volatility: low inside trough, rise becomes faster later.\\n- t = 126\u2013143 (end): Strong terminal rise. From ~t=126 the series climbs rapidly to a final peak \u2248+2.4\u20132.6 by t=143. Change rate: relatively fast positive slope at the end (~+0.15 units/step average). STFT: renewed low-frequency energy at end columns (bottom rows brightly colored). Overall frequency content for major events is concentrated at very low frequencies; short higher-frequency ripples are minor and low power.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary, temporal dependencies and combinations:\\n- Dominant character: low-frequency, multi-lobe contour with three primary broad events: early high baseline \u2192 deep early trough, a mid-section with a moderate hump then a larger main hump (asymmetric: moderate rise into a strong peak then steeper fall), and a late recovery culminating in a strong terminal rise. The STFT confirms most energy is in the lowest frequency bins during the key windows (start, mid block around ~39\u201395, and at end).\\n- Periodicity & temporal spacing: quasi-periodic slow undulations with major extrema spaced tens of steps apart (~30\u201340 steps between major extrema). The mid-block contains a two-lobe structure (smaller hump then larger hump) that is temporally ordered and phase-linked (zero crossing then hump then larger hump then fall) \u2014 a clear temporal dependence exploited by the classifier.\\n- Volatility: low within broad lobes (smooth ramps), higher instantaneous slope only during transitions (not persistent high-frequency jitter). Minor high-frequency wiggles exist but with very low STFT magnitude and visually minor effect.\\n- Combination relationships: the classifier would likely treat the mid-window two-step hump (small hump around ~48\u201352 followed by dominant hump ~72\u201378), the initial high\u2192deep trough, and the final strong rise as additive evidence. Asymmetry of the mid-cycle (slower build, faster fall) is a distinctive timing/substructure cue.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match against provided label feature summaries and selection:\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter) feature summary highlights: strongest positive SHAP in lowest frequency rows between ~39 and 95; mid-segment pattern of a modest hump near ~48\u201355 then a dominant hump about ~72\u201378 with a relatively slower rise and faster drop; presence of large endpoint rises but mid-segment is decisive. This aligns very closely with the observed sample: matching timing of mid-block double-hump, asymmetry (gradual build to big peak then steep drop), low-frequency dominance in STFT, and strong final rise.\\n- Comparison with other labels briefly:\\n  - Label 0 (Mirage): also low-frequency dominated, but its strongest positive at ~13\u201330 and different combinations of troughs/peaks; less emphasis on the particular mid-block two-lobe asymmetric cycle characteristic of Eurofighter. Some similarity but less precise.\\n  - Labels 2/3/4/5/6: all describe low-frequency multi-lobe patterns in places, but their typical key windows, amplitudes and substructure differ (e.g., Label 2 emphasizes troughs at windows ~13\u201326, ~104\u2013120; Label 3 shows different distribution of large negative lobes and pulses; Label 4 centers a dominant mid hump but with different timing/amplitude relationship; Label 5\u2019s main hump timing/amplitude pattern differs; Label 6 penalizes mid-frequency sharp transitions). The sample best matches Label 1\u2019s combination of features.\\n- Therefore I select label 1 (Eurofighter) as the best match. Quantified similarity for chosen label: 4 (high similarity). The sample matches the label_1 description and all four provided reference samples for label 1 are visually and spectrally nearly identical to the test sample.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Verification with reference samples and fairness of scoring:\\n- Visual comparison: the four \u201csimilar\u201d references (samples 36, 27, 40, 88) are essentially the same waveform: identical early high start and decline, deep early trough near t~25, a modest hump near t~48\u201352, a larger peak near t~72\u201378, a steep fall afterwards and a strong final rise. Their STFTs show the same low-frequency energy concentrated in the mid block and ends. The test sample reproduces these features very closely in amplitude, timing, and low-frequency energy distribution.\\n- Dissimilar references (samples 39 and 79, label 3) differ: they show different mid-block shapes (more/larger negative lobes and different hump timing), and their STFTs show stronger low-frequency power in different windows; these do not match the particular two-lobe mid-sequence pattern and the asymmetry seen in the test sample.\\n- Scoring rationale: Because both time-domain shape (timing/amplitude/asymmetry of key lobes) and time-frequency content (low-frequency concentration in identical windows) align closely with label 1\u2019s description and the provided label-1 examples, assigning the highest similarity score (4) is justified. Other labels (0,2,3,4,5,6) show at most partial overlap on some low-frequency troughs or endpoint rises but lack the precise ordered mid-block two-lobe + asymmetry signature; therefore they are lower similarity and do not compete with label 1.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1 (Eurofighter) with similarity score 4. The classification is supported by: (1) precise temporal alignment of the two mid-block humps (small hump ~48\u201352 then dominant hump ~72\u201378), (2) asymmetry (slower rise vs. faster fall) of that dominant hump, (3) initial high-to-deep-trough early pattern and (4) strong low-frequency STFT energy concentrated in the same time windows as label-1 references.\"\n  ]\n}",

Increased mid-frequency energy coincides with the steep post-peak descent (~t=75\u201390) and some transition zones, which the time plot shows as steeper, higher-rate changes. Overall volatility is low inside lobes and higher during transitions (especially immediate post-peak falls).\",\n    \"2) Periodicity and envelope: The series has quasi-periodic behavior at a low effective frequency: major extrema occur roughly every 35\u201345 time steps (early trough ~25, moderate hump ~45, dominant peak ~73, trough ~90\u2013115, final rise by 143). This yields a 2\u20133 large-scale oscillation pattern across 144 points. The envelope is coherent: phases are consistent (initial high \u2192 deep trough \u2192 build to big mid peak \u2192 faster fall \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise).\",\n    \"3) Asymmetry and change-rate patterns: Notably, important rises (start\u2192trough recovery, W2 rise, W3 rise) tend to be slower/gradual than some falls which are comparatively steeper (e.g., fall after the major mid-peak). The mid-segment features are temporally ordered and the model would reasonably use that ordering (zero crossing before main hump, big asymmetric hump, faster descent) as distinguishing structure.\",\n    \"4) Combination/temporal dependence: The classification-relevant signature is not a single isolated event but the combination and ordering of low-frequency lobes: high start, deep early trough, subsequent modest hump, dominant mid-peak, steeper fall, later trough, then terminal strong rise.

STFT: low-frequency energy returns at the end; contributes additional positive mass to global shape.\\n\\nSummary of local features: The series is dominated by several broad low-frequency lobes: an early high\u2192deep trough, a mid modest hump then a dominant large mid hump (~t=72), a faster decline to trough then small rebound, a late trough and a final large ascent. High-frequency content is minimal overall and appears only briefly during faster decays; STFT confirms energy concentrated in the very lowest frequency rows aligned with the main lobes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features, periodicity, volatility, temporal dependencies:\\n- Trend & periodicity: Quasi-periodic at low frequency: roughly two-to-three broad cycles across 144 points (trough\u2192peak\u2192trough\u2192peak\u2192final rise). The dominant period places strong energy in the lowest frequency STFT bins. The large mid peak (t\u224872) is the single most prominent event.\\n- Asymmetry: Mid-segment cycle is temporally asymmetric \u2014 slower buildup and faster decline \u2014 which is a salient temporal substructure.\\n- Volatility: Low volatility inside broad lobes (smooth ramps), with higher instantaneous slopes (and slightly elevated mid-frequency energy) only during rapid descents. Small high-frequency wiggles are minor and not dominant.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: The classifier-like cues would favor the ordered sequence: start-high \u2192 wide trough \u2192 small mid hump \u2192 large mid hump \u2192 fast fall \u2192 small rebound \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise. The relative timing of the small hump before the large mid hump and the fast decay thereafter is an important combined signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and initial label selection:\\n- Compare to label_1 (Eurofighter) summary: label_1 description emphasizes a strong low-frequency mid-segment activation between ~39\u201395, with a small hump near ~48\u201355, then a dominant peak near ~72\u201378 and a faster drop to a trough near ~86\u201390; also a late upward trend is mentioned but not decisive. Test sample 20 matches these hallmark elements closely: (1) small hump around 48\u201352, (2) dominant hump peaking ~72\u201376 with asymmetric faster fall, (3) trough and small rebound around ~86\u201396, and (4) strong low-frequency energy in mid-window in STFT. This is a near-complete match to label_1 features.\\n- Compare to other labels: label_0 (Mirage) also emphasizes low-frequency lobes but its strongest positive windows differ in timing and shape (e.g., trough at ~25\u2192slow rise 26\u201365 is core for Mirage). While sample 20 has a trough at ~25, the strongest discriminative mid hump and the exact small-hump-then-large-hump sequence align better to label_1. Labels 2,3,4,5,6 show different timing/amplitude patterns or penalize the asymmetric mid-cycle shape or have distinct mid/late hump structures that do not match as well.\\n- Therefore initial selection is label 1 (Eurofighter) with high confidence.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples (verification):\\n- The four provided 'similar' reference samples (Samples 33, 27, 103, 86 all label 1) are visually near-identical: same start-high \u2192 deep early trough near 25 \u2192 small hump around 48\u201352 \u2192 dominant mid hump ~72\u201378 \u2192 fast fall \u2192 later trough \u2192 final rise. Their STFTs also show the concentrated low-frequency energy in the mid-window and weaker high-frequency content elsewhere. Test sample 20 matches these references in waveform shape, timing of substructures, amplitudes of main lobes, asymmetry of the main hump, and STFT distribution. Differences are only in small-amplitude local wiggles and tiny timing jitter, well within intra-class variation.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' samples (label 3) show different mid-sequence behavior: more frequent mid-sequence smaller oscillations and different placement/amplitude of major lobes; their STFTs show higher relative mid-frequency energy in different time windows. These differ clearly from sample 20.\\n- Scoring fairness: Given the near one-to-one correspondence between the test sample's major discriminative elements and the label_1 feature list and reference plots, assigning the highest similarity score (4) to label 1 is justified. Other labels show only partial or weak overlap (e.g., some low-frequency troughs are common across classes but the ordered small-hump\u2192large-hump\u2192fast-fall motif is specific to label_1). \\n\\nFinal verdict: label 1 (Eurofighter) with high similarity score 4.\"\n  ]\n}",

High-frequency content is minimal; STFT confirms energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during the main events. Volatility is generally low inside lobes, with sharper slopes at transitions (especially main peak descents).\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall characterization and temporal relationships:\\n- Frequency & periodicity: the sample is low-frequency / quasi-periodic with roughly two to three large-scale undulations across 144 steps.

The mid-segment shows a characteristic asymmetry: slower rise into the main mid peak and a faster subsequent fall. This asymmetry is a salient temporal substructure.\\n- Volatility: low within each broad hump/trough, moderate during transitions (especially descents), and very little high-frequency jitter across the series. The sample\u2019s discriminatory features are the timing, amplitude and ordering of the broad lobes rather than small spikes.\\n- Temporal dependence: successive events are phase-linked \u2014 e.g., the zero crossing near t\u224838 precedes the mid-hump growth, the small hump near 48 precedes the larger hump near 72, and the late final ramp occurs consistently after the later trough. The model would therefore exploit the sequence (small hump \u2192 larger hump \u2192 fast fall) as a pattern feature.\\n- Combination relationships: classification-relevant evidence is additive across the broad, well-timed low-frequency lobes: the mid two-hump structure (smaller hump then larger hump) in the middle of the sequence combined with high endpoints strengthens a specific class signature while localized mid-frequency content would detract (but is minimal here).\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching to provided label patterns and feature lists:\\n- Compare to label 1 (Eurofighter) summary: label-1 descriptions emphasize a strong low-frequency mid-segment between ~39\u201395 with a modest hump around ~48\u201355 followed by a larger peak near ~72\u201378, plus an asymmetric slower rise and faster fall and supporting late-edge rise. Sample 38 shows those same elements: (1) small hump near 48\u201352; (2) dominant mid hump near 72\u201376 with asymmetric rise/fall; (3) troughs before/after and a strong terminal rise. STFT corroborates concentrated low-frequency energy in the mid window.

Sample 38 has different mid-lobe timing/ordering (distinct two-lobe mid pattern) so only partial similarity.\\n  * label 2 (F\u201114 wings closed): also low-frequency multi-stage troughs/peaks appear in that summary but their timing and patterning differ (F\u201114 closed shows strong early troughs, repeated humps at specific windows distinct from the two-step mid-hump asymmetry of label 1). Partial overlap but not as close.\\n  * label 3 (F\u201114 wings opened): shows several separated large negative lobes and a different midstructure with more low-frequency negative pulses; the reference dissimilar samples also show more mid-segment differences. Less similar.\\n  * label 4 (Harrier): dominated by one dominant central hump between ~52\u201371 (a single large mid bump). Sample 38 shows two mid humps (small then large) rather than a single dominant central hump, so lower similarity.\\n  * label 5 (F\u201122) and label 6 (F\u201115): both involve low-frequency lobes and endpoint amplitude, but their characteristic shapes (e.g., F\u201122 primary hump at ~36\u201370 but usually smaller amplitude, F\u201115 broad envelope with penalized mid-frequency bursts) do not match the precise two-stage mid-hump asymmetry and timing seen here.\\n- Based on the above, the best matching label is label 1 (Eurofighter).

Their STFTs show the same bottom-row concentration in roughly the same columns. This confirms the visual and spectral matching is strong and consistent.\\n- The two dissimilar references (label 3) show different mid-segment structure and sometimes more pronounced different trough/peak placements; they do not match the two-stage mid-hump asymmetry apparent in Sample 38. This supports rejecting label 3.\\n- Fairness and scoring check: the '4' score assigned to label 1 is supported by near-one-to-one correspondence of the sample\u2019s primary discriminative features to the label-1 feature list and to multiple near-identical training examples. Lower scores were assigned to other labels because they share only some generic low-frequency traits but not the precise timing, amplitude ordering and asymmetry that define the Eurofighter signature here.\\nFinal decision: label 1 (Eurofighter) with high similarity score = 4.\"\n  ]\n}",

STFT: strong energy in the lowest frequency bins during the rise/peak window.\\n- t = 81\u201396: Post-peak fall and rebound. The signal falls to roughly -0.8 to -1.2 by ~t\u224886\u201390 then rebounds into a modest hump around ~+0.6 near t\u224894. These transitions are faster than the broad rises (some mid-frequency content shows up in STFT during sharper changes).\\n- t = 97\u2013124: Progressive decline to another trough. The trace gradually declines again into a substantial trough near t\u2248116\u2013122 with values ~ -1.4 to -1.6. Shape: broad trough with low volatility inside, descent rate moderate.\\n- t = 125\u2013143 (end): Strong terminal rise. From ~t=125 the series climbs consistently and finishes at a large positive value \u2248 +2.5 at t=143. Change rate: relatively steep terminal rise; STFT shows re-emergence of low-frequency power near the end.\\n\\nStep 1 frequency/volatility notes (STFT-assisted):\\n- Across almost all major events, energy concentrates in the lowest-frequency rows of the STFT (very-low-frequency, long-wavelength components). The brightest low-frequency blocks align with the early trough window (\u224813\u201330), the mid positive hump region (\u224845\u201380) and the final window (>125). Mid-frequency bins show only modest energy during the sharper descents/falls (transitions) and higher-frequency micro-jitter is minimal and not dominant.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall sample-level characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Dominant trend: The sequence is governed by broad, low-frequency undulations (several large lobes) with an early high baseline, an early deep trough, two main mid-late positive lobes (a smaller one near t\u224850 and a larger main hump near t\u224874), followed by a trough and then a final strong terminal rise. This is a multi-lobe, low-frequency envelope rather than a noisy or high-frequency signal.\\n- Periodicity & structure: Quasi-periodic slow oscillation with roughly 2\u20133 broad cycles across 144 points: trough around 24, hump around 50, major hump around 74, trough around 116, then final rise. The relative ordering (small mid hump then larger hump then fall) is important \u2014 the larger hump follows the smaller hump in the mid-sequence.\\n- Volatility: Low inside the broad lobes (smooth ramps), higher during the steeper descents/falls (some mid-frequency energy). Overall the sample is low-volatility at the scale that matters for classification (low-frequency), with only localized faster transitions.\\n- Combination/temporal dependence: The classifier-relevant signature is the ordered arrangement of large-scale features: early high \u2192 deep trough \u2192 small mid hump \u2192 larger central hump \u2192 fall \u2192 trough \u2192 final rise. The relative amplitudes (early and final endpoints large, interior lobes moderate-to-large), timing (mid humps at \u224850 and \u224874), and asymmetries (slower rises, faster falls in places) form a coherent composite shape.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and preliminary label selection:\\n- Compare to label_1 (Eurofighter) summary: Label 1 description emphasizes a pronounced mid-segment low-frequency oscillation between ~t=39\u201395 composed of a smaller hump near ~48\u201355 and a larger main peak around ~72\u201378, with an early decline from a high start and a late upward trend (but mid-segment is decisive). Sample 38 matches this very closely: same ordering (small mid hump then larger hump), peak timings (~50 and ~74), early high\u2192drop, and final terminal rise. STFT low-frequency energy aligns with those windows as in label_1. Degree of match: very high.\\n- Compare to label_0 (Mirage): Label 0 relies on low-frequency broad ramps, notably a strong positive low-frequency block around t\u224826\u201365 in some examples and multiple broad lobes. There is some overlap \u2014 sample 38 has broad low-frequency energy and multiple lobes \u2014 but the specific mid-window asymmetry and two-stage hump pattern (small hump then larger hump at ~72) are more strongly characteristic of label_1. Degree of match: moderate.\\n- Compare to label_2 (F-14 wings closed) and label_3 (F-14 wings opened): Both F-14 variants emphasize different trough/hump arrangements; label_2 shows several troughs and repeated low-frequency humps but with different timing emphasis, and label_3 has large early negative swings with other patterns. Sample 38 does show troughs but the mid-segment two-hump asymmetry and the strong mid-late peak are not the canonical F-14 signatures in the provided summaries. Degree of match: low-to-moderate for label_2, low for label_3.\\n- Compare to label_4 (Harrier): Harrier's hallmark is a very strong single mid bump around ~t=52\u201371 peaking near +2.6 and a trough-to-peak contrast. Sample 38's central peak is large but not as single-dominant or as high as the Harrier prototype (+1.8\u20131.9 vs ~+2.6), and there is the earlier small hump which Harrier references do not emphasize. Degree of match: low-to-moderate.\\n- Compare to label_5 (F-22): F-22 displays a primary positive hump around ~36\u201370 but typically smaller amplitude (~+0.6\u20130.8), plus endpoint positives. Sample 38 has a stronger central hump and a two-hump mid pattern, so similarity is moderate but less than label_1.\\n- Compare to label_6 (F-15): F-15 shows a broad low-frequency envelope across much of the mid-series with twin peaks and penalizes sharp mid-frequency transitions. Sample 38 shares some features (broad low-frequency envelope and twin mid peaks), but the timing and the characteristic two-step mid hump that label_1 stresses are a better match to label_1. Degree of match: moderate-low.\\n\\nPreliminary label pick: label 1 (Eurofighter) \u2014 highest match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and finalize scores:\\n- The four \u201csimilar\u201d reference samples are all labeled 1 and, visually, are near-identical to the test sample: they have the same early high start, deep trough near t\u224825, small hump near t\u224850, major peak at t\u224874, subsequent fall and final rise. Their STFTs also show low-frequency energy concentrated in the same time windows. This close match to multiple labeled-1 training exemplars strongly reinforces the assignment to label 1.\\n- The two dissimilar references (labeled 3) show different mid-sequence morphology (more pronounced oscillatory detail in the 50\u2013100 window and different hump/t trough ordering) and do not match the test sample; this supports down-weighting label 3.\\n\\nSimilarity scoring (1\u20134) for each label (justification):\\n- label 0 (Mirage): 3 (moderate). Shares low-frequency multi-lobe behavior and early/final large offsets with the test sample, but the precise mid-window two-stage hump (small then larger at ~72) is less characteristic of the Mirage examples presented.\\n- label 1 (Eurofighter): 4 (high). Very high match: early decline from high, small mid hump (~48\u201355), dominant main hump (~72\u201378), asymmetry (slower rise / faster fall), STFT low-frequency alignment, and overall ordering match the label_1 summary and the 4 provided label-1 reference plots almost exactly.\\n- label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 2 (low). Some shared broad troughs and reccurrences exist, but timing/shape pattern is not a close match to the F-14 (closed) prototypes described.\\n- label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 1 (no similarity). The dissimilar reference samples show noticeably different mid-sequence structures and the label_3 description emphasis (different trough/peak arrangement) does not fit the test sample.\\n- label 4 (Harrier): 2 (low). Harrier expects a very dominant central hump of larger amplitude and a slightly different surrounding trough structure; test sample has a strong central hump but is lower amplitude and accompanied by a preceding mid hump \u2014 not a close match.\\n- label 5 (F-22): 3 (moderate). There is similarity in having a mid-sequence positive hump and endpoint positives; however the two-stage mid hump and the magnitude/timing of the main peak align more with label 1 than the F-22 prototype.\\n- label 6 (F-15): 2 (low). Some broad envelope similarity and twin peaks exist, but mid-sequence asymmetry and the specific hump ordering point away from the canonical F-15 pattern in the provided summaries.\\n\\nFinal verification and decision:\\n- Multiple independent cues (time-domain ordering of humps/troughs, amplitude of the mid humps especially the primary hump at ~t=74, the STFT low-frequency energy alignment, and close visual match to four labeled-1 reference examples) consistently indicate the best label is label 1 (Eurofighter).\\n- I therefore output label 1 with a similarity score of 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

This rise is relatively brisk compared with earlier ramps (moderate-to-strong positive slope). Shape: broad peak (several steps wide), low volatility inside the rise/peak. STFT: concentrated low-frequency energy during the rise and peak.\\n- t=79\u201390: Rapid fall to a trough. The series falls from the mid-late peak quickly to about -0.8 to -1.0 by t\u224886\u201390. Change rate: faster negative slope than the preceding rise (asymmetry: slower build, faster decay). STFT: a bit more mid-frequency power during the faster descent but still dominated by low frequencies.\\n- t=91\u2013105: Small rebound and secondary hump. There is a small positive rebound centered ~t\u224894\u2013100 (peaking ~+0.6\u2013+0.8) then a descent.

This produces repeated low-frequency undulations rather than high-frequency oscillations.\\n- Asymmetry & slopes: The mid-cycle rises tend to be slower/moderate while falls are often faster (notably the descent after the large mid peak). The final rise is relatively steep compared to some prior rises.\\n- Volatility: Low within the broad lobes (smooth ramps and peaks), moderate during transitional windows (the faster falls and small rebounds). High-frequency noise is minimal overall.\\n- Temporal dependencies: The classifier would likely exploit the ordered sequence of features: (1) a high starting baseline and early large descent into a trough, (2) a two-stage mid-section with a smaller hump followed by a larger hump near t\u224872, then (3) a fast drop and later recovery concluding in a strong terminal ascent. The timing and relative amplitudes of the mid small-hump \u2192 main hump \u2192 fast fall sequence are particularly diagnostic.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists and provisional label choice:\\n- Compare with label 1 (Eurofighter) summary: Label 1 descriptions emphasize a mid-segment low-frequency cycle between ~39\u201395 consisting of a modest hump at ~48\u201355 then a larger main peak near ~72\u201378 followed by a fast descent to a trough near ~86\u201390; STFT energy concentrated at lowest frequencies in that mid window; late rising trend sometimes present but mid-window pattern is decisive. The test sample shows all these: a small mid hump ~45\u201350, a larger main hump at ~72\u201376, a rapid fall into a trough ~86\u201390, and concentrated low-frequency energy in those windows. Temporal ordering, asymmetry (slower rise, faster fall), and low volatility within the peaks match very strongly. => High match.\\n- Compare with label 0 (Mirage): Label 0 focuses on broad low-frequency rises especially t\u224826\u201365 and final strong rise and multiple low-frequency lobes. There are shared elements (low-frequency dominance, multi-lobe structure, trough around 25 and subsequent rise). However, label 0's strongest positive evidence centers on a single sustained slow rise from ~26\u201365 that is the classifier's primary cue. Our sample has a stronger small hump then main hump structure in the mid region (more like label 1). => Moderate match.\\n- Compare with label 2 (F-14 wings closed): Label 2 shows early steep fall into trough ~25, mid humps ~36\u201352 and ~65\u201391, and a pronounced late trough ~104\u2013120 then recovery. Sample 41 shares early trough at ~25, mid positive humps, and a late trough then final rise. This is reasonably similar but label 2's characteristic emphasis on the pronounced late trough centered earlier (~104\u2013120) and the repetition of certain hump/trough timings is slightly different; sample timing and the distinctive mid-window asymmetry (small hump then larger at ~72) are more aligned to label 1. => Moderate match.\\n- Compare with label 3 (F-14 wings opened): Label 3 shows multiple separated low-frequency negative lobes and more prominent negative mid troughs with different timing and some higher-frequency wiggles in mid windows. Our sample exhibits fewer of label-3's characteristic shape details (the mid hump structure and the precise mid-window asymmetry). => Low match.\\n- Compare with label 4 (Harrier): Harrier profiles emphasize a dominant central big hump around t\u224852\u201371 reaching very high positive amplitude (~+2.6). Our sample's main mid peak is slightly later (~72\u201376) and of lower amplitude (~+1.6\u20131.9). Harrier also tends to have a stronger single central hump as primary cue; our sample has a two-stage mid structure (small hump then bigger hump) and a rapid drop after the larger hump, which aligns better with label 1. => Low-to-moderate match.\\n- Compare with label 5 (F-22): F-22 features a mid hump (~36\u201370) with a steeper rise and somewhat different edge/secondary lobes; sample shares some mid-hump behavior but the two-stage hump pattern with a larger main peak followed by a fast fall (and the exact timing at ~72) is closer to label 1. => Low-to-moderate match.\\n- Compare with label 6 (F-15): F-15 shows persistent low-frequency envelope across the middle, multiple broad peaks and troughs and penalizes mid-frequency sharp transitions. Our sample has repeated broad peaks/troughs and low-frequency dominance, but the specific mid-window small-hump\u2192large-hump\u2192fast-fall motif is characteristic of label 1. => Low-to-moderate match.\\n\\nProvisional classification: label 1 (Eurofighter) because the hallmark mid-window structure (small hump around ~48\u201355 then larger peak around ~72 and a rapid fall into trough at ~86\u201390), the asymmetry of rise vs. fall, and STFT low-frequency concentration in that mid window match the label-1 description very closely.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples and final similarity scoring:\\n- The four similar reference samples (labels 27, 33, 103, 77 \u2014 all labeled 1.0) are visually and spectrally near-identical to test sample 41: they share the same early high \u2192 deep trough (~t\u224825) \u2192 modest hump (~t\u224845\u201352) \u2192 large main hump (~t\u224872\u201378) \u2192 fast drop (~t\u224886\u201392) \u2192 small rebound \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise pattern. Their STFTs likewise show concentrated low-frequency energy in the mid window. The test sample matches these references almost exactly in timing, amplitude relationships and spectral content. This strongly confirms label 1.\\n- The two dissimilar references (labels 39 and 67, both label 3.0) differ: they present different mid-window structures and different distribution of troughs/peaks (and more mid-frequency content in some windows). The test sample is visibly and spectrally unlike those dissimilar examples.\\n\\nFinal per-label similarity scores (1\u20134):\\n- label 0 (Mirage): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 shares low-frequency multi-lobe structure and some timing but lacks the exact mid small-hump \u2192 large-hump asymmetry that is most diagnostic of label 0's description)\\n- label 1 (Eurofighter): 4 (high similarity \u2014 near-match in mid-window two-stage hump, timing, asymmetry, STFT low-frequency concentration; also matches the provided reference examples closely)\\n- label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 has early trough and late trough/recovery like label 2, but mid-window structure and asymmetry are more label-1-like)\\n- label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 2 (low similarity \u2014 some broad low-frequency lobes coincide but key mid-window pattern and spectral emphasis differ)\\n- label 4 (Harrier): 2 (low similarity \u2014 Harrier emphasizes a single dominant central hump with different amplitude/timing; test sample shows two-stage mid pattern instead)\\n- label 5 (F-22): 2 (low similarity \u2014 shares a mid hump but amplitude timing and the two-stage mid pattern align less well)\\n- label 6 (F-15): 2 (low similarity \u2014 broad low-frequency envelope is similar, but test sample's diagnostic mid-window sequence matches label 1 more closely)\\n\\nConsistency check and final decision:\\n- The matched reference samples (all label 1) are nearly identical in waveform and STFT to the test sample; the feature summaries corroborate that label-1 description explicitly (small hump ~50 then larger hump ~72 then fast fall). Timing, amplitude ratios, low-frequency dominance and asymmetry all line up.\\n- Therefore the final, most accurate classification is label 1 (Eurofighter) with high confidence. The overall confidence score for this label is 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}"

This produces a coherent broad-envelope pattern across the 144 points.\",\n    \"2) Periodicity & energy: energy is concentrated at very low frequencies (STFT bottom rows bright during main events). The signal is quasi-periodic at a long timescale (broad cycles ~40\u201380 points), not dominated by short-period oscillations.\",\n    \"3) Volatility & transitions: broad segments are smooth (low volatility), whereas transitions (notably the fall after the mid peak) are comparatively sharp and produce some mid-frequency power which SHAP tends to treat as neutral or slightly negative. The model rewards slow, smooth bulges and penalizes abrupt, high-frequency edges.\",\n    \"4) Temporal dependence & ordering: the mid-window zero crossing (~38) reliably precedes the discriminative mid-cycle; the classifier (as shown by SHAP) weighs the order (small hump \u2192 large hump \u2192 fast fall) strongly.

I locate the same interval on the time plot and describe its fine structure:  \u2022 Time range: ~39\u201396 (primary discriminative window).  \u2022 Amplitude: the window contains a modest early rise around t\u224839\u201352 up to \u2248+0.6\u2013+0.9, a decline to a trough near t\u224856\u201364 (\u2248-0.9 to -1.1), then a pronounced, slow, large-amplitude ascent peaking around t\u224872\u201378 at \u2248+1.6 to +1.9 before falling again toward \u2248t=86\u201392 down close to -1.0.

The rise into the main hump is smoother/gradual while the following decline is comparatively steeper (asymmetric cycle).  \u2022 Change rates & volatility: within this interval slopes are moderate (gradual build-ups ~+0.04\u2013+0.12 units/step into peaks, faster declines ~-0.15 to -0.25 units/step on descents). Volatility is low within lobes (smooth ramps) and higher only at transitions.  \u2022 Frequency confirmation: the STFT shows concentrated energy in the lowest frequency bins for the same time range, confirming these are genuine low-frequency (broad) components rather than short spikes.  \u2022 Additional positive patches: weaker low-frequency positive SHAP is also present at the ends (start and end) but with much lower intensity than the mid-window; these correspond to large positive endpoints (t\u22480 and t\u2248143).\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall sample characterization and feature combination:  \u2022 Global shape / periodicity: the whole 144-point trace is dominated by several slow, broad undulations (low fundamental frequency).

The mid-window two-stage hump + phase ordering is most consistent with label_1.  \u2022 Therefore I select label 1 (Eurofighter) as the predicted class and assign a high similarity score of 4 (high similarity) because a near-identical feature description appears in the label_1 summary and the four provided similar reference samples are visually and spectrally very close to the test sample.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and dissimilar examples:  \u2022 Reference samples (Samples 61, 88, 40, 8) labeled 1 show the same global pattern: large positive start, descent to an early trough, mid-segment two-stage low-frequency cycle (small hump then big hump ~72\u201378), and strong SHAP red in the same low-frequency mid rows.

Map that to the time series:\",\n    \"   - Time range: \u2248 t = 39 \u2192 t = 96 (mid-sequence).\",\n    \"   - Amplitude: the segment contains a multi-stage low-frequency cycle: a moderate positive hump around t\u224848\u201355 (\u2248 +0.6 to +0.9), a following decline to negative values near t\u224858\u201366 (\u2248 -0.8 to -1.0), and then a dominant broad peak centered near t\u224872\u201378 (\u2248 +1.6 to +1.9).\",\n    \"   - Trend & substructure: the substructure is ordered: small hump \u2192 trough \u2192 larger hump (a clear phase progression). The rise into the main peak is smooth and sustained over ~10\u201315 steps; the fall after the main peak is noticeably faster (asymmetric).\",\n    \"   - Change rate & volatility: within the mid-window the rises are low-frequency (slow, steady increase; typical slope ~+0.05 to +0.18 units/step for the big ascent), volatility is low during the broad lobes (no high-frequency jitter), while the descent from the main peak into the trough around t\u224886\u201392 is steeper (higher instantaneous slope, higher mid-frequency energy).\",\n    \"   - Frequency support (from STFT): the STFT shows most spectral magnitude aligned with the bottom frequency rows in this mid window, confirming that these are low-frequency (long-wavelength) features rather than sharp high-frequency spikes. This matches the SHAP attribution being strongest in the lowest-frequency rows.\",\n    \"2) Secondary positively-contributing region: a late rising trend from ~t=130 to the end (t=143) shows a strong upward movement ending near +2.4\u2013+2.6. STFT shows low-frequency energy at the end and SHAP has weaker positive attribution there (supporting evidence but less intense than the mid window).\",\n    \"3) Early segment: t=0\u2192~25 shows a strong initial decline from a high positive start (~+2.5) into a deep trough near t\u224820\u201326 (~-1.3 to -1.6). STFT places energy at low frequencies here; SHAP in the earliest window is weak-to-moderate (the classifier registers it but relies more on the mid-window).\",\n    \"4) Negative/neutral contributions: sharper, faster transitions (for example the rapid drop right after the main mid peak and some localized higher-frequency wiggles around t\u224860\u201366 and t\u224888\u201396) show increased mid-frequency STFT energy and tend to have neutral-to-slightly-negative SHAP values in mid/high rows \u2014 indicating the model prefers smooth low-frequency structure and downweights abrupt high-frequency content.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal dependence:\",\n    \"1) Global shape and periodicity: the series is dominated by a low-frequency quasi-periodic envelope made of broad lobes (roughly two to three large undulations across 144 points).

The ordering (phase) of the mid small hump \u2192 trough \u2192 large hump \u2192 sharp fall is pronounced and is the primary positive evidence used by the classifier (per SHAP).\",\n    \"3) Volatility: broad events are smooth (low volatility); sharper transitions (steeper slopes) occur during falls and are associated with some negative attribution at mid frequencies. Overall the sample emphasizes smooth, large-scale contour features rather than noisy microstructure.\",\n    \"4) How features combine: SHAP indicates additive positive evidence when multiple low-frequency lobes appear in the expected time positions (mid-window low-frequency cycle is the strongest cue; the final rise adds supporting evidence). High-frequency content locally reduces confidence but does not dominate because the dominant low-frequency structure aligns strongly with class patterns.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries (direct pattern matching):\",\n    \"1) Label 1 (Eurofighter) summary key points: strong positive SHAP concentrated in lowest-frequency rows ~39\u201395, a mid-segment multi-stage low-frequency oscillation (small hump then larger hump) with asymmetric slow rise/faster decay, and sometimes a late upward trend.

STFT: clear low-frequency energy in bottom row during this early descent.\\n- t = 16\u201335: Deep broad trough. Values reach roughly -1.0 to -1.6 (min near t\u224824\u201328). The trough is wide (sustained over ~10 steps), low volatility inside trough, slow curvature (low-frequency content). STFT still concentrated at lowest frequency bins here.\\n- t = 36\u201356: Recovery and a modest positive hump. The signal climbs from trough to cross zero and reaches a modest local peak around t\u224852\u201356 (amplitude \u2248+0.5\u2013+1.0). Change is smooth though slope is gentler than the early drop. STFT: bottom-frequency energy reappears, indicating a slow hump rather than sharp spikes.\\n- t = 57\u201380: Strong mid-to-late positive bulge with a pronounced main peak ~t\u224872\u201380 (amplitude \u2248+1.6 to +1.9). The ascent into this peak is relatively clear (moderate slope) and the subsequent fall is somewhat faster (asymmetric rise/fall). Volatility is low inside the bulge; STFT shows elevated magnitude concentrated at the lowest frequency rows across much of this window (dominant low-frequency contribution).\\n- t = 81\u2013100: Decline to a trough around t\u224888\u201394 (amplitude ~-0.8 to -1.1) followed by a small rebound near t\u224896. This transition shows more mid-frequency content than the broad humps (STFT shows slightly broader banding), indicating the fall is somewhat sharper than the earlier low-frequency rises. Local volatility increases modestly during the decline.\\n- t = 101\u2013125: Small positive-to-negative oscillation and a moderate valley. There is a modest positive blip around t\u2248104 followed by a descent to a valley near t\u2248116 (\u2248-1.3 to -1.1). These are lower in amplitude than the main mid peak and show moderate low-frequency energy with occasional mid-frequency content.\\n- t = 126\u2013143: Strong final sustained rise. The series climbs from ~-0.2/0.0 near t\u2248126 to a large endpoint near +2.4\u2013+2.6 at t=143. The rise is relatively smooth and carries strong low-frequency energy in STFT.\\n\\nStep 1 summary: The sample is dominated by large, smooth low-frequency lobes (early high -> deep trough -> moderate hump -> large mid peak -> trough -> final rise). High-frequency jitter is minor and localized to transitions; STFT confirms energy concentrated primarily at the lowest frequency bins during the main events.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall features, temporal dependencies and combination:\\n- Global trend & periodicity: quasi-periodic slow oscillation composed of ~3 broad low-frequency cycles across 144 steps: an early descent & trough, a mid positive cycle culminating in the dominant peak (~t70\u201380), and a late recovery to a large endpoint. The spacing between extrema (~30\u201345 steps) indicates dominant very-low-frequency content.\\n- Volatility: Low within broad lobes (smooth ramps), higher during falls and local transitions (notably after the main peak and before the final rise). Overall volatility is low compared to amplitude of the lobes.\\n- Asymmetry & change-rate: Several cycles show asymmetric ramps \u2014 mid major hump shows a moderate/gradual build and a faster decline, while the final rise is relatively steady and strong. The classifier would likely treat slow rises and broad peaks as positive cues and sharper falls/rapid mid-frequency bursts as less supportive or even penalizing, consistent with the STFT concentration.\\n- Temporal dependence: The ordering of events (high start \u2192 deep early trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 dominant mid-peak \u2192 trough \u2192 final rise) is important \u2014 the mid-segment broad bulge is the single strongest event, supported by early baseline and final rise. STFT alignment with low-frequency rows during those windows confirms that these are long-wavelength contour features.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature summaries (initial scoring):\\n- Check label_1 (Eurofighter): The label_1 summary emphasizes a strong mid-segment low-frequency oscillation between ~39\u201395 with a smaller hump near ~48\u201355 then a major peak near ~72\u201378, followed by a fall to a trough ~86\u201390 and sometimes a late rise. Sample 59 contains: (a) modest hump in the 48\u201356 region, (b) a dominant mid peak around 72\u201380 with asymmetry (slower rise, faster fall), (c) a trough in the late-80s, and (d) a large late rise. STFT also shows concentrated low-frequency energy in the mid segment and at edges. This is a near textbook match with label_1\u2019s described pattern.\\n- Check other labels quickly:\\n  * label_0 (Mirage): characterized by mid-window slow rise from trough ~25 to 60 and multiple low-frequency lobes; while sample 59 has multiple lobes, the precise mid-cycle asymmetry and the two-humped mid structure match label_1 better than label_0 descriptions.\\n  * label_2/3 (F-14 variants): these include repeated deep troughs and other timing differences; sample 59 timing and the strong mid positive peak align less well with label_2/3 than with label_1.\\n  * label_4/5/6: each has different dominant timing/shape (e.g., label_4 has single dominant mid hump but placed slightly differently and with certain asymmetry; label_5 has primary hump earlier and smaller; label_6 emphasizes persistent low-frequency envelope across long interval). Sample 59 most closely matches the label_1 combination of smaller hump -> larger hump -> faster fall -> trough -> eventual rise.\\n\\nInitial similarity judgement: strongest for label_1. Numeric similarity for predicted label_1 = 4 (high similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Verification against reference samples and final consistency check:\\n- Four provided 'similar' reference samples are all labelled 1 and visually follow the same pattern: high positive start \u2192 deep early trough near t\u224825 \u2192 modest hump around 50 \u2192 major peak around 72\u201380 \u2192 fall into trough near 88\u201395 \u2192 late ascent to endpoint. Sample 59 replicates these key landmarks (timing, amplitude ranges, asymmetry, low-frequency dominance). STFTs of those references show the same concentration of energy in the lowest frequency rows in the mid segment and at edges \u2014 sample 59\u2019s STFT matches this distribution (strong low-frequency energy at the same mid and edge windows). That reinforces correctness.\\n- Two provided 'dissimilar' samples are labelled 3 and show different mid-segment morphology (different relative timing of peaks/troughs, different local structure). Sample 59 differs from those dissimilar examples in the position and relative magnitude of mid-lobes, confirming it is not label_3.\\n- Fairness and scoring logic: similarity = 4 is justified because almost all defining characteristics in the label_1 feature summary are present in sample 59 (early high baseline + deep early trough + small hump then main hump ~72\u201378 + faster fall + trough + late strong rise), and the four reference label_1 instances are visually and spectrally near-identical to the test sample. Minor variations (small local wiggles and exact slope magnitudes) are within the variability seen across the reference label_1 examples.\\n\\nFinal decision: predict label 1 (Eurofighter) with similarity score 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

Mapping that interval to the time-series plot: \u2022 0\u201313: large positive start (~+2.5) with a smooth decline to ~0 by ~13. \u2022 ~13\u201326: continued decline into a broad trough reaching about \u22121.3 to \u22121.6 (lowest trough near t\u224825). This trough is wide and smooth (low volatility). \u2022 ~36\u201355: a smooth rise to a modest positive hump (\u2248+0.6\u2013+0.9 around t\u224848\u201355). Volatility here is low and the change rates are moderate. \u2022 ~60\u201376: a stronger, slow-to-moderate rise that culminates in the largest mid-sequence peak (~+1.8 to +1.95 near t\u224872\u201376).

Across the positively attributed region the waveform is dominated by broad, low-frequency lobes (low volatility within lobes, moderate slopes), consistent with strong SHAP emphasis at the DC/very-low-frequency rows. The STFT corroborates this: most energy in those same low-frequency bins in the mid-window (39\u201395) and little energy at higher frequencies there, indicating the model is reacting to slow, large-scale contour features rather than short spikes.\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall sample characterization and temporal dependencies: The series is dominated by large low-frequency components (several broad lobes) with low local volatility inside lobes and sharper transitions between lobes (asymmetric rise/fall).

The classifier\u2019s SHAP focuses on the mid-window broad oscillation and rates higher the slow, ordered sequence (small hump \u2192 larger hump \u2192 faster decline).

Their SHAP heatmaps also concentrate red at the same lowest-frequency band in the same mid-window. The two dissimilar examples (labels 3.0 samples 79 and 46) show different mid-to-high-frequency SHAP patterns (and differing placement/amplitude of their major lobes), reinforcing that sample 73 aligns with the label-1 prototypes rather than label-3.

This rise-then-faster-fall asymmetry is pronounced and aligns with the SHAP emphasis. \\n  - Volatility & substructure: Within the positively-attributed block the waveform is dominated by smooth, low-volatility ramps and broad lobes; there are very small high-frequency ripples (amplitude \u22720.2) but STFT energy and SHAP weight concentrate in the DC / lowest frequency bins, indicating these are slow, long-wavelength shape features rather than transient spikes. \\n  - Frequency support: The STFT during ~39\u201396 shows strongest energy in the bottom-most frequency bins (confirming the SHAP attribution originates from true low-frequency content). Higher-frequency rows show little power and are neutral or slightly negative in SHAP (so fast oscillations would reduce class support). \\n- Secondary positively-attributed regions: The SHAP map also shows modest low-frequency positive values at the very start (t\u22480) and mild positive near the end (~130\u2013143) but these are weaker. Correspondingly the raw trace starts high (~+2.6 at t=0) and ends high (~+2.6 at t=143); STFT shows low-frequency energy at the edges but SHAP emphasis is clearly strongest mid-sequence. \\n- Conclusion for Task 1: The classifier is using broad, low-frequency mid-sequence morphology \u2014 specifically the ordered small hump near ~48\u201355, a trough, a larger hump near ~70\u201376, and the asymmetric faster fall after the main peak \u2014 as the principal positive evidence. These features are smooth (low volatility), of moderate-to-large amplitude, and concentrated in the lowest STFT bins.\"\n    ,\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and feature combination:\\n- Dominant behaviour: The series is dominated by low-frequency, multi-lobe structure across the 144 points: an initial large positive offset and descent (t\u22480\u219212), a deep early trough (~15\u201325), mid-sequence double-lobe structure (~39\u201396) with a small hump then a larger hump, a mid/late trough (~100\u2013120), and a final strong rise to a high positive endpoint (~130\u2013143). \\n- Periodicity & frequency content: The STFT shows most energy concentrated at very low frequencies (bottom rows), consistent across the major lobes. There is little high-frequency energy overall; where mid-frequency bursts appear (during steep transitions, e.g. the fall after the mid peak) they are not emphasized by SHAP. \\n- Volatility & slopes: Volatility is generally low within the broad lobes (smooth ramps). The shape exhibits asymmetric cycles: rises tend to be more gradual and falls can be steeper \u2014 particularly the descent after the main mid peak. \\n- Temporal dependence & ordering: The mid-sequence zero-crossing near ~38 precedes the small hump and then the larger hump: the order small hump \u2192 trough \u2192 larger hump \u2192 fast fall is critical. SHAP\u2019s localization to the mid segment (not to the edges) shows the model relies on the timing and relative amplitudes of these mid-sequence lobes. \\n- How features combine: Multiple separated low-frequency lobes (small mid hump + main mid hump) compose the strongest positive evidence; edge high amplitudes only provide secondary support. Any mid/high-frequency spikes would detract from the score (as indicated by neutral/blue SHAP in higher rows).\"\n    ,\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label feature sets (quick mapping):\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter) summary highlights: strong positive SHAP in the lowest frequency band between ~39\u201395, a mid-segment asymmetric cycle with a smaller hump ~48\u201355 then a larger hump ~72\u201378, and the model relying on ordering (zero crossing near ~38 then the mid-cycle). That description is a near-exact match to the observed mid-sequence positive SHAP block and raw waveform shapes. \\n- Other labels: many other classes emphasize low-frequency content too (labels 0,2,5,6), but their characteristic timing and substructure differ (e.g., label 0 emphasizes trough\u2192slow rise in 26\u201365, label 4 centers a dominant peak ~52\u201371 but with different surrounding trough timing and amplitude; label 3 has multiple separated negative lobes and different timing). The observed sequence and the strong SHAP concentration specifically between ~39\u201396 match label 1\u2019s canonical mid-segment signature most closely. \\n- Preliminary decision: label 1 is the best fit based on both pattern and SHAP localization.\"\n    ,\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final scoring: \\n- Comparison to similar reference samples (Samples 33, 88, 61, 103 \u2014 all labeled 1): visually these reference traces show the same structure: large positive start, descent to an early trough, a small mid hump near ~48\u201355, then a larger mid hump near ~70\u201376, then a steeper fall and later recovery to a high endpoint. Their STFTs also concentrate energy in the lowest bins during the mid window and their SHAP maps show concentrated red in the same low-frequency mid-region. Sample 74\u2019s raw trace, STFT and SHAP are highly consistent with these references in timing, amplitude relationships, asymmetry of rise/fall and frequency content. \\n- Comparison to dissimilar references (Samples 87 and 25 \u2014 labeled 3): those show different mid/late structure (more/earlier separated negative lobes, different timing of positive pulses), and their SHAP patterns differ in time-location and sign. Sample 74 differs clearly from those. \\n- Final similarity scoring rationale (labels 0\u20136):\\n  - label 0 (Mirage): shares general low-frequency multi-lobe theme; but the precise mid-sequence asymmetric two-hump pattern and SHAP timing align better with label 1. Score = 3 (moderate).\\n  - label 1 (Eurofighter): near-complete match in core discriminative features (mid-window low-frequency double-hump with asymmetry, SHAP concentrated ~39\u201395). Score = 4 (high similarity).\\n  - label 2 (F-14 wings closed): has multi-stage low-frequency troughs and humps but timing and ordering differ (strong early troughs and later trough peaks at different locations). Score = 2 (low).\\n  - label 3 (F-14 wings opened): different pattern (other trough/peak timings and SHAP distribution). Score = 2 (low).\\n  - label 4 (Harrier): Harrier emphasizes a very prominent mid hump around ~52\u201371; sample 74 has a strong mid hump but the combination (small hump then larger hump at ~70 and the asymmetric fall) is more like label 1. Score = 2 (low\u2013moderate).\\n  - label 5 (F-22): shows mid lobes but generally smaller primary hump positions and different relative timing; sample 74 is closer to label 1. Score = 2 (low).\\n  - label 6 (F-15): persistent low-frequency envelope like sample 74 but penalizes mid/high-frequency bursts; timing/shape differences make it a poorer match than label 1. Score = 2 (low).\\n- After careful cross-checking with reference plots, STFTs and SHAP heatmaps, the model\u2019s mid-sequence low-frequency double-hump with the ordering and asymmetry strongly indicates label 1 (Eurofighter).\"\n  ]\n}",

      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 1\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local (red SHAP) feature extraction and fine-grained description:\\n- Identified red (positive SHAP) mass: concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows (closest to 0 Hz) spanning roughly time steps ~39 \u2192 ~95 (most intense around ~52\u201392). Two weaker positive areas also appear at the lowest-frequency row near ~13\u201326 and a modest low-frequency positive near the very end (~130\u2013143).\\n- Mapped these SHAP windows to the time series (plot):\\n  * Window A (main, t \u2248 39\u201395): This corresponds to a sequence of low-frequency lobes: a moderate positive hump centered ~45\u201352 (amplitude \u2248 +0.6 to +0.9), then a descent into a trough around ~56\u201364 (\u2248 -0.8 to -1.1), then a pronounced large peak centered \u2248 70\u201374 (amplitude \u2248 +1.7 to +1.95). Immediately after that peak there is a relatively steep fall into negative values by \u2248 80\u201388 (\u2248 -1.0 to -1.2). Character: energy concentrated in very-low-frequency band (STFT confirms), low within-hump volatility (smooth ramps inside lobes), faster change rate at the peak-to-trough transitions (the rise into the main peak is fairly brisk and the subsequent fall is steeper). The substructure is multi-stage: small hump \u2192 trough \u2192 larger hump \u2192 fast drop; shape: broad, low-frequency convex bulges separated by troughs.\\n  * Window B (early, t \u2248 13\u201326): SHAP weakly positive at low frequency. In the series this maps to the early decline from the high start (~+2.6 at t=0) down to a local trough (~-1.3 to -1.6 around t\u224820\u201326). Character: large-amplitude, slow-to-moderate slope descent with low volatility inside the trough; STFT shows low-frequency power here.\\n  * Window C (end, t \u2248 130\u2013143): modest positive low-frequency attribution aligning with a strong terminal rise from roughly ~+0.1 at ~130 to \u2248 +2.5 at the end. Character: sustained low-frequency upward ramp, low volatility in the final climb.\\n- Frequency confirmation: The STFT heatmap shows the largest magnitudes at the lowest frequency bins aligned with the same time windows above, confirming the red SHAP regions correspond to true low-frequency (broad-shape) content rather than short spikes. Higher-frequency rows show little energy in those windows.\\n- Volatility & change rates (local): Within the broad lobes volatility is low (smooth ramps). Transitions into/out of the main peak (around t~60\u201380) are brisk \u2014 the rise into the major peak and the fall from it are comparatively steep, producing some mid-frequency content in STFT but the dominant energy and SHAP remain at the lowest band.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall sample-level feature summary and temporal dependence:\\n- Global trend & envelope: The series begins at a high positive value (~+2.6), declines to a deep early trough (~t\u224820\u201326), then exhibits a mid-sequence multi-lobe pattern (small hump \u2192 deeper trough \u2192 large hump \u2192 steep fall \u2192 small rebound), followed by a later trough and a strong final rise to a large positive endpoint (~+2.5). The overall energy is dominated by very-low-frequency components (STFT bright at bottom rows across main windows).\\n- Periodicity & structure: Quasi-periodic low-frequency oscillation with roughly 2\u20133 broad undulations across the 144 steps (spacing on the order of 30\u201340 steps between extrema). The key discriminative mid-sequence envelope (\u224839\u201395) shows an ordered substructure (smaller positive lobe then larger positive lobe) that repeats the coarse curvature motif and is temporally phase-consistent.\\n- Volatility: Low within broad lobes; higher instantaneous slopes at transitions (notably the rise into and fall from the main mid peak). Small high-frequency wiggles are minor and carry little attribution.\\n- Combination & temporal dependence: The classifier appears to combine several separated low-frequency cues additively: early decline/trough, the mid two-stage hump pattern (small hump \u2192 big hump \u2192 fast drop), and the final strong rise. The ordering matters \u2014 the zero crossing / trough preceding the mid-cycle hump acts as a phase anchor and the relative amplitudes and asymmetry (slower rise / faster fall in some subsegments) are important.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label summaries and initial label selection:\\n- Compare to provided label feature lists and reference examples:\\n  * Label 1 (Eurofighter): described as having a prominent mid-segment low-frequency asymmetric cycle (small positive hump ~50 then larger positive hump ~72) with a steeper subsequent fall (strong SHAP in lowest frequencies between ~39\u201395). The sample\u2019s strongest SHAP and STFT patterns exactly align with that mid-window motif (small hump then larger hump near ~72 and a rapid drop). The similar reference samples (33, 88, 61, 103) are visually almost the same as this test sample in both waveform and SHAP patterns. => Very high match.\\n  * Label 0 (Mirage): also emphasizes low-frequency lobes but its strongest positive attribution tends to be centered earlier (~13\u201330) and across different relative peak/trough timing; some similarity exists (low-frequency dominance and multi-lobe structure) but timing/substructure differences reduce match. => Moderate match.\\n  * Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): has multiple low-frequency trough/hump events with strong low-frequency attribution at several windows (early trough, mid humps, late trough). There are shared elements (early trough, later trough and mid humps) but its prototypical ordering and emphasis differ vs. the clear mid-centered Eurofighter motif. => Moderate match.\\n  * Label 4 (Harrier): dominant single mid-segment large positive hump (t\u224852\u201371) is similar to one element of our series \u2014 but Harrier\u2019s pattern is typically a dominant isolated mid-bump rather than the specific two-stage small\u2192large hump and the asymmetric drop seen here. => Moderate-to-low match.\\n  * Label 5 (F-22) & Label 6 (F-15): both show low-frequency lobes, but their described substructures (amplitudes, relative timing, and penalty of mid-frequency sharp transitions) are less consistent with the pronounced two-stage mid-cycle and strong SHAP concentration seen here. => Low match.\\n  * Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): focuses on different negative- and positive-lobe patterns (deep troughs and different timing); the sample\u2019s mid-segment positive, two-stage hump is not consistent. => Low match.\\n- Initial label choice: label 1 (Eurofighter) has the strongest alignment: the mid-segment low-frequency positive attribution concentrated in the same time window, the same small-hump followed by a larger-hump then faster descent substructure, and identical STFT/SHAP signatures. Therefore label 1 is selected.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Re-check with reference examples and finalize similarity scoring:\\n- Cross-check with the four provided similar reference samples (Samples 33, 88, 61, 103): All four have practically identical waveform shapes (early high \u2192 decline \u2192 small mid hump \u2192 main peak around ~70 \u2192 steep fall \u2192 late recovery) and their SHAP heatmaps show deep red at the bottom frequency rows in the same mid window. This strongly supports label 1. The two dissimilar references (samples labeled 3) differ noticeably in mid-window shape and SHAP distribution, supporting the distinction.\\n- Final per-label similarity judgments (1\u20134) based on comprehensive comparison to the provided summaries and references:\\n  * label 0: 3 (moderate \u2014 shares low-frequency multi-lobe character but not the exact mid-window two-stage hump timing/ordering)\\n  * label 1: 4 (high \u2014 near-identical mid-window low-frequency two-stage hump and SHAP pattern; reference samples match closely)\\n  * label 2: 3 (moderate \u2014 multiple shared low-frequency events but ordering/relative amplitudes differ)\\n  * label 3: 1 (no similarity \u2014 different mid-window shape and SHAP emphasis)\\n  * label 4: 3 (moderate \u2014 shares a mid positive hump but lacks the exact two-stage asymmetric mid-cycle pattern)\\n  * label 5: 2 (low similarity \u2014 some broad lobes in common but amplitudes/timings differ)\\n  * label 6: 2 (low similarity \u2014 global low-frequency envelope is similar but mid-window sharp transitions and attribution patterns diverge)\\n\\nConclusion (final output):\\n- Predicted class: label 1 (Eurofighter). Rationale: the test sample\u2019s strongest SHAP and STFT signals are concentrated in the lowest-frequency band in the mid-sequence (\u224839\u201395) and map to a distinct ordered substructure (small hump \u2192 larger hump near t\u224870 \u2192 fast drop) that matches the label-1 description and all four provided label-1 reference samples almost exactly. The combined waveform shape, spectral evidence, SHAP attribution, and temporal ordering give a high-confidence match. The single aggregated score returned with the result is 4 (high similarity to label 1).\"\n  ]\n}"

I therefore inspect that time window in the raw trace and in the STFT.\\n- Time window 39\u201352: the series rises from a slightly negative/near-zero baseline (~-0.2 around t\u224839) to a modest local peak \u2248+0.9 near t\u224850\u201352. The rise is smooth (low volatility), spanning ~12\u201314 steps with an average slope \u2248 +0.06\u2013+0.08 units/step. STFT: low-frequency energy concentrated at the bottom rows here. SHAP: positive at lowest-frequency rows (supports model relying on slow structure).\\n- Time window 52\u201366: after the small peak, the series declines smoothly to a trough around t\u224862\u201366 reaching roughly -0.5 to -0.7. The decline is somewhat quicker than the earlier rise (moderate slope negative), producing a low-frequency downward flank. STFT still dominated by lowest frequencies; SHAP remains positive mainly at bottom rows over the whole mid-segment.\\n- Time window 66\u201378 (primary discriminative event): a pronounced, smooth large ascent occurs from roughly -0.6 (\u2248t\u224866) up to the main mid-sequence peak \u2248+1.7 to +1.9 at t\u224875\u201378. Net change \u2248 +2.3 over ~10\u201312 steps, average slope \u2248 +0.18\u2013+0.23 units/step (noticeably faster than the earlier small hump). Volatility inside the ascent and near the peak is low (no high-frequency spikes). STFT: very strong energy at the lowest frequency rows during this rise/peak. SHAP: deep red concentrated exactly at the lowest-frequency rows for this interval \u2014 indicating the model uses this broad low-frequency bulge as a key positive cue.\\n- Time window 78\u201395: after the main mid peak the trace falls relatively fast into negative territory (by ~t\u224890 the value is near -0.6 to -0.8), then shows a small rebound/hump around t\u224895 (\u2248+0.4\u2013+0.6). The fall is steeper than the preceding rise (asymmetric shape). STFT shows low-frequency energy across this fall and rebound; SHAP still positive at lowest-frequency rows while mid-frequency rows are neutral \u2014 the model prefers the broad asymmetric cycle rather than sharp texture.\\n- Secondary positive SHAP: there is minor positive SHAP near the end (~t\u2265130) corresponding to the final broad rise from ~-1.5 (around t\u2248118) to a large endpoint \u2248+2.4 at t=143. That rise is also low-frequency and yields modest positive attribution but is weaker than the mid-segment block.\\n- Frequency detail supporting the local description: STFT confirms the dominant energy for the mid-segment events is at the bottom frequency bins (<~0.05 normalized), consistent with SHAP's emphasis on low-frequency components. Higher frequencies show little energy in the red-attributed windows and generally do not contribute positively in SHAP.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Global shape / trend: The sequence is dominated by a set of broad, low-frequency lobes: an early decline from a high start (t0 \u2248 +2.5) down to the deep trough near t\u224826 (\u2248-1.8), then a mid-region of two-stage behavior (small hump then the large hump centered ~75), then a later deep trough (\u2248t\u2248110) and a strong final rise to a high endpoint (~t=143 \u2248+2.4). The series therefore exhibits large-amplitude, slow undulations (quasi-periodic at long period ~40\u201380 time steps between major extrema).\\n- Periodicity & spacing: Major extrema occur at roughly t\u224825 (early trough), ~52 (small mid hump), ~76 (large mid peak), ~110 (late trough), and final peak at 143 \u2014 i.e., roughly 20\u201340 steps between significant extrema, consistent with low-frequency content.\\n- Volatility: Within broad ramps (the classified mid-hump, early troughs, final rise), volatility is low (smooth monotonic change). Some transitions are asymmetric \u2014 rises are often more gradual and falls can be faster (notably the fall after the main mid peak). Small higher-frequency wiggles appear on some descending flanks but carry low power in STFT and negligible/neutral SHAP.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: The classifier\u2019s positive attribution accumulates when multiple low-frequency lobes appear with the observed ordering: smaller mid hump \u2192 trough \u2192 dominant mid peak \u2192 faster fall. The mid-segment structure (both the presence and sequencing of the moderate hump followed by the larger hump) is the strongest joint cue; the weaker end rise adds support but is not decisive on its own.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison to the provided label feature lists (candidate matching):\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter) pattern summary: strong positive SHAP in lowest frequency between ~39\u201395, mid-segment two-stage low-frequency oscillation (small hump ~50 then major peak ~72\u201378), asymmetric slow build and faster decay, late rise sometimes present but not decisive. This aligns extremely closely with sample 78's mid-segment: a small hump (~50), trough (~62), then major peak (~75) and faster decline. STFT/SHAP patterns match (dominant low-frequency energy in mid window). => Match degree: 4 (high similarity).\\n- Label 5 (F-22) pattern summary: also emphasizes a broad mid hump around ~36\u201370 and repeated lobes, with endpoint amplitudes supportive. Sample 78 has a primary mid hump and supporting lobes, so there is some similarity, but label 5 descriptions typically have somewhat less pronounced two-stage mid structure and different asymmetry emphasis. => Match degree: 3 (moderate similarity).\\n- Label 0 (Mirage) pattern summary: focuses on strong low-frequency attribution but often with strong early and final broad rises plus mid trough\u2192rise between ~26\u201365. Sample 78 shares low-frequency dominance and multiple broad lobes including early and final rises, but the central mid-region timing and the two-stage hump (small hump then larger hump) are more characteristic of label 1 than label 0. => Match degree: 3 (moderate similarity).\\n- Label 6 (F-15) summary: long low-frequency envelope across middle of series, penalizes mid-frequency sharp transitions. Sample 78 has extended low-frequency envelope but also contains the distinctive ordered small hump \u2192 large hump mid-segment that matches label 1 more closely. => Match degree: 2\u20133; conservatively 2 (low\u2013moderate similarity).\\n- Label 2 (F-14 wings closed) and Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): both have multi-stage low-frequency troughs/peaks but their template windows (timing of strongest attribution) and the shape of events differ (F-14 closed shows early steep fall and multiple troughs emphasized; F-14 open emphasizes large early negative swings and mid troughs). The mid-segment two-hump asymmetry of sample 78 matches Eurofighter references more closely than these F-14 patterns. => Match degrees: label 2 = 2 (low similarity), label 3 = 1 (no/very low similarity).\\n- Label 4 (Harrier) emphasizes a single dominant mid-segment large positive hump around ~52\u201370. Sample 78 does have a strong mid hump but it has a clear two-stage structure (smaller hump then larger peak) and the exact timing/asymmetry matches label 1 templates better. => Match degree: 2 (low similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with training reference samples and final verification:\\n- The provided four similar reference samples (samples 27, 36, 103, 33) are all labeled 1 and their plots, STFTs and SHAP maps are visually nearly identical to sample 78: the same early decline, the small mid-hump near ~50, a larger mid peak centered ~72\u201378, strong low-frequency STFT energy at the same mid-window, and SHAP positive concentrated at lowest-frequency rows in that same window. This strong congruence with multiple labeled examples in the training set is robust evidence that the model will (and should) assign label 1.\\n- The two dissimilar reference samples (14 and 89) are label 3 and show different mid-structure: while they share some low-frequency power, their SHAP maps emphasize different time windows and show different substructure (e.g., more prominent early/other troughs, different ordering of peaks/troughs). Visually and in the SHAP maps they diverge from sample 78, reinforcing that label 3 is not a good match.\\n- Given the nearly one-to-one match in (a) mid-window timing, (b) two-stage mid morphology (small hump then larger hump), (c) low-frequency STFT energy alignment, and (d) concentrated low-frequency SHAP attribution that mirrors the label-1 reference examples, the correct final classification is label 1 (Eurofighter). The similarity score of 4 reflects high alignment with the label-1 feature summary and the provided label-1 reference samples.\\n\\nSummary conclusion:\\n- Final predicted label: label 1 (Eurofighter).\\n- Similarity score to chosen label: 4 (high similarity).\\n- Per-label similarity judgments used to reason the choice (for completeness): label_0:3, label_1:4, label_2:2, label_3:1, label_4:2, label_5:3, label_6:2.\"\n  ]\n}",

Mapping that to the time series: \u2022 Time-range and amplitude: from ~t=39\u201352 the trace climbs from about -0.6/ -0.4 to a local hump near +0.9\u20131.0 (a modest low-frequency rise). It then declines to a trough near t\u224862\u201366 (about -0.5 to -0.8), and afterwards rises again to a pronounced main peak at t\u224872\u201378 with amplitude \u2248 +1.6\u20131.9 (largest mid-segment peak). By t\u224888\u201392 the series has fallen back toward roughly -0.6 to -1.0. \u2022 Change rates & slopes: the initial mid-window rise (\u224839\u219252) is moderate (\u2248 +0.1\u20130.15 units/step on average), the subsequent fall to the mid trough is gentler, and the ascent into the main peak (\u224862\u219275) is relatively brisk (\u2248 +0.14\u2013+0.22 units/step). \u2022 Volatility & substructure: volatility within these events is low \u2014 the lobes are smooth and broad (low-frequency) with only small high-frequency ripples superposed. The mid-window shows a two-stage low-frequency substructure: a smaller hump then a larger hump (the smaller at ~48\u201352, larger at ~72\u201378). \u2022 Frequency evidence: the STFT shows concentrated energy in the lowest-frequency bins during this same mid-window, confirming the SHAP-positive attribution corresponds to true low-frequency (broad contour) content rather than short spikes. In short, the model is attributing the classification positively to a two-stage, low-frequency mid-segment oscillation (small hump \u2192 trough \u2192 larger hump) with smooth shape and moderate slope into the main peak.\"\n  ,\n  \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and dependencies: \u2022 Global pattern: the sequence begins at a large positive value (~+2.5 at t=0) then declines to a deep trough (~-1.8 near t\u224826).

A later deep trough appears around t\u2248110\u2013118 (~-1.3 to -1.5) followed by a strong final rise to ~+2.4\u20132.6 at the sequence end. \u2022 Frequency & volatility: energy is concentrated at very low frequencies for the major lobes (STFT bright at bottom rows during key windows). Local high-frequency jitter is minor and does not carry positive SHAP weight. Abrupt transitions (where present) have more mid-frequency power but are not strongly positively attributed. \u2022 Temporal dependence / combination: the classifier seems to sum evidence from multiple low-frequency lobes and is sensitive to their order. The mid-window small hump \u2192 larger hump (with a zero/near-zero crossing preceding the mid pattern) forms the most decisive evidence; early and terminal large amplitudes supplement but are secondary. The sample\u2019s strong, ordered mid-segment low-frequency oscillation plus the early/late large offsets make the full-sequence signature coherent and phase-consistent rather than a set of isolated spikes.\"\n  ,\n  \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature lists and selection rationale: \u2022 Comparing to provided label summaries, label 1 (Eurofighter) is described as: 'Strong positive SHAP in lowest frequency rows between \u224839\u201395; mid-segment two-stage low-frequency cycle \u2014 a smaller hump (~48\u201355) then a dominant peak (~72\u201378) then a fast decline; energy concentrated at lowest frequencies; late rise may exist but mid-window is decisive.' This matches the exact spatiotemporal pattern seen in the sample: the mid-window low-frequency two-lobed structure, timing of main peak ~72\u201378, and concentrated low-frequency STFT power align closely. \u2022 Other labels: label 0,2,4,5,6 feature low-frequency energy but their characteristic timing/shape differs (e.g., label 0 emphasizes trough\u2192slow rise in a different mid window and multiple other broad lobes; label 2/3 often show different trough/peak timing or multiple separated valleys with different SHAP localization). Label 3 (F-14 wings-open) reference samples show strong low-frequency lobes at different positions and more negative mid-frequency contributions; the provided dissimilar examples (labels 3) show noticeably different mid-sequence morphology (and their SHAP patterns differ in timing/structure). \u2022 Conclusion: label 1 is the closest match in both the explicit feature summary and the four similar reference examples provided (all labeled 1), which resemble sample 78 nearly exactly in waveform shape, timing of mid small hump and main mid peak, STFT low-frequency concentration, and SHAP localization.

The sample under test matches these characteristics in timing, amplitude ratios (smaller mid hump vs main mid peak), smoothness, and STFT/SHAP alignment. \u2022 Fairness & scoring: given the near one-to-one match with the label-1 summary and the near-identical shape to multiple label-1 reference plots, the similarity should be 'high'.

On the time series this corresponds to: a moderate positive hump peaking near t\u224852 (amplitude \u2248 +0.9), a decline to a local negative around t\u224862 (\u2248 -0.6), then a strong, smooth rise to the largest mid-sequence peak near t\u224875\u201378 (amplitude \u2248 +1.8 to +1.9), followed by a fairly rapid fall toward t\u224890 (\u2248 -0.7). Detailed attributes: amplitudes vary from about -0.6 to +1.9; the rise into the large mid peak is relatively steep (about +1.7 amplitude over \u224812\u201315 steps \u2192 average slope ~+0.11\u2013+0.14 per step on the main ascent) while the descent after the peak is faster (larger negative slope over fewer steps). Volatility in this block is low at the scale of the hump (smooth, low-frequency), with only small higher-frequency ripples superimposed. The STFT shows concentrated energy at the bottom frequency rows in this same time window, confirming these are low-frequency (broad/slow) components \u2014 matching the SHAP attribution to low-frequency features.\",\n        \"2) Earlier SHAP-positive (weaker) activity appears near t\u22480\u201315 at the lowest frequency bin (small red in SHAP). On the plot the series starts very high (\u2248 +2.5 at t=0) and declines smoothly to the early trough near t\u224825 (\u2248 -1.8). The SHAP/ STFT pairing shows low-frequency energy here too (broad early fall). This early broad descent is treated as supportive but is weaker in SHAP than the mid-sequence block.\",\n        \"3) Smaller positive SHAP (low-frequency) appears again at the sequence end (t \u2273 120) but weaker than the mid window. On the trace there is a strong final rise from roughly t\u2248125 (\u2248 -0.9..-1.3) to t=143 (\u2248 +2.5). STFT shows re-emergence of low-frequency energy at the end; SHAP gives modest positive weight \u2014 so the final broad terminal rise is additional, but secondary, evidence.\",\n        \"4) Negative or neutral SHAP appears at some mid-frequency rows during fast transitions (especially during fast descents after peaks). This matches STFT showing some mid-frequency content during the sharper downslopes; the model penalizes mid-frequency (sharper) components relative to smooth low-frequency lobes.\",\n        \"Step 1 summary (unambiguous local markers): The classifier\u2019s strongest positive evidence for this sample are the two mid-sequence low-frequency lobes in sequence: (a) a moderate hump around t\u224848\u201355 (~+0.9), (b) a larger hump/peak around t\u224870\u201378 (~+1.8) with smooth rises and a faster fall \u2014 both concentrated in the lowest STFT rows and flagged red in the SHAP heatmap.

The overall behavior is dominated by slow, broad curvature (low-frequency) events rather than continuous high-frequency oscillation.\",\n        \"2) Periodicity & envelope: The signal is quasi-periodic at a long timescale (period on the order of tens of steps ~40\u201380), showing 2\u20133 broad cycles (trough\u2192peak\u2192trough) across the sequence. Energy in the STFT is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins during the major events, indicating most discriminative structure is the large-scale envelope.\",\n        \"3) Volatility and change-rate heterogeneity: Volatility is low inside the broad lobes (smooth ramps). Change rates differ by phase: rises into peaks are generally smoother/moderate, whereas declines after peaks can be steeper (higher instantaneous slope and some mid-frequency energy). Small high-frequency wiggles exist but have negligible STFT magnitude and neutral-to-negative SHAP.\",\n        \"4) Temporal dependence and ordering: Crucially, the mid-sequence pattern is ordered: a smaller positive hump (\u224848\u201355) precedes a larger positive hump (\u224872\u201378) and then a faster fall \u2014 this specific ordering, amplitude relationship and timing (the zero-cross/transition near \u224838 preceding the mid-cycle) are the strongest positive cues per SHAP.

      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 1\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local feature (follow SHAP red region):\\n- SHAP highlights a strong, concentrated positive block at the lowest frequency rows between roughly time steps 39 and 95. Mapping that to the time plot: the mid-sequence window (\u2248t=39\u202695) contains a sequence of slow, large-scale lobes that drive the classifier.\\n- Detailed description of the mid-window structure (the main positively attributed feature):\\n  - Substructure and timing: a modest positive hump around t\u224844\u201352 (peak \u2248 +0.6 to +0.9), then a smooth decline to a trough near t\u224856\u201364 (\u2248 -0.6 to -0.8), followed by a larger, broad positive peak centered around t\u224870\u201376 (peak \u2248 +1.6 to +1.9) and then a fall toward \u2248t=86. The SHAP red block covers the rising flank into the large peak and the peak region itself.\\n  - Amplitude & trend: the larger mid hump (t\u224870\u201376) is the strongest positive item (amplitude change from trough to peak ~2.3\u20132.6 units). The smaller hump (t\u224844\u201352) is lower amplitude but clearly ordered before the main hump.\\n  - Change rates & asymmetry: rises into the main peak are moderate-to-quick (average slope on the principal ascent \u2248 +0.08\u2013+0.18 units/step), while the subsequent descent is noticeably steeper in places (fall slope larger in magnitude). The earlier small hump has a gentler slope.\\n  - Volatility & shape: within each hump/trough the signal is smooth with low local volatility (no large high-frequency spikes). Most variability is carried by the slow envelope (broad convex/concave shapes) rather than by fast oscillations.\\n  - Frequency content: the STFT shows concentrated energy at the bottom frequency bins for these time ranges, confirming the SHAP attribution is tied to true low-frequency components (broad contour features) rather than short transients. Mid- and higher-frequency bins carry little energy there and in some places are slightly penalized by SHAP (blue), so the model explicitly prefers the slow-scale morphology.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series features & time dependence:\\n- Global trend & endpoints: the series begins high (~+2.5 at t=0), falls to a deep early trough at \u2248t=25 (\u2248 -1.8), recovers into the mid-window lobes described above, then later declines again to a mid-late trough (~t\u2248110, \u2248 -1.6) before a final strong rise to an endpoint \u2248+2.5. So there are 2\u20133 full slow undulations across the 144 points.\\n- Periodicity & frequency: the trace is dominated by low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation (broad lobes spaced ~30\u201350 steps). STFT confirms energy concentrated in the lowest frequency rows during the main events; high-frequency content is weak overall.\\n- Volatility profile: volatility is low inside the broad humps/troughs (smooth ramps). Sharper transitions (some faster descents) produce modest mid-frequency energy and are not positively attributed by SHAP \u2014 the model disfavors abrupt, high-frequency edges for this class.\\n- Temporal ordering dependence: the mid-sequence small hump \u2192 trough \u2192 larger hump \u2192 fast fall pattern (with a zero crossing / phase anchor near t\u224838 before the discriminative mid-cycle) is a crucial temporal arrangement and is strongly emphasized by SHAP. The combination of the two mid lobes (their relative sizes and ordering) plus the early trough and endpoint rise forms the composite signature used for classification.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label summaries and selection of best label:\\n- The described mid-window pattern (two ordered low-frequency lobes: a smaller hump then a larger hump centered around ~72, with a rapid fall after the large peak), low-frequency dominance, and the model\u2019s positive attribution to that mid-segment match very closely the feature summary for label 1 (Eurofighter) in the provided reference descriptions. Label 1's pattern explicitly emphasizes a mid-segment asymmetric slow cycle (small hump near ~48 and main hump near ~72) and SHAP concentration in the bottom frequency rows in that window \u2014 which is exactly what we observe for sample 79.\\n- Comparison to other labels:\\n  - Label 0 (Mirage): also low-frequency dominated but its strongest positive attribution in the examples is concentrated at different time windows (notably earlier/late rises and a particular trough\u2192rise mid-window); sample 79's distinctive two-stage mid-cycle matches label 1 descriptions more specifically.\\n  - Labels 2, 3 (F-14 closed/open) and 4,5,6: these classes show different timing/ordering of strong low-frequency lobes or more/less emphasis on late troughs/peaks or sharper transitions. In particular the two-slow-lobe, smaller-first-then-larger mid pattern is repeatedly and uniquely associated with label 1 in the supplied summaries and reference plots.\\n- Therefore the best label is label 1 (Eurofighter). I assign a high similarity score (4) because the sample\u2019s waveform, STFT and SHAP patterns align very closely with the label-1 feature description and with the four provided reference samples for label 1 (the plots are near-identical in shape, timing, and the SHAP low-frequency emphasis).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and dissimilar ones:\\n- The four similar references (samples 27, 33, 103, 36) all show the same ordered small-hump then larger-hump mid-window, the same early descent and final endpoint rise, the same STFT low-frequency concentration, and SHAP red concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows in the mid window. Sample 79 matches those in both visual waveform shape and the attribution map very closely \u2014 differences are only in small local wiggles and slightly different exact peak amplitudes, which are within class variability.\\n- The dissimilar references (labels 3.0 examples) show different mid-sequence structure and different SHAP patterns (their positive SHAP blocks occur at different times and they have stronger positive attribution at other time windows). This reinforces that sample 79 is not best matched to label 3.\\n\\nFinal answer summary:\\n- Chosen class: label 1 (Eurofighter).\\n- Similarity justification & score: high similarity (4/4) because the sample\u2019s mid-window two-stage low-frequency lobes, STFT low-frequency energy, and SHAP attribution pattern correspond closely to the label-1 description and to the provided label-1 reference samples. The temporal ordering (small hump \u2192 trough \u2192 large hump) and low local volatility inside these lobes are the decisive, matching features.\"\n  ]\n}",

Amplitude: climbs from negative/near-zero up to the largest mid-segment peak \u2248 +1.6 to +1.95 (peak ~72\u201376).

This faster fall produces small mid-frequency content in STFT but the SHAP positive attribution is still dominated by the lowest-frequency bins centered on the earlier rise/peak rather than these faster transition components.\",\n    \"3) Additional weaker supportive region: The SHAP map has light positive low-frequency attribution around the later rising edge (t \u2248 118\u2013144) but with much lower magnitude than the mid window. In the time series this corresponds to the final sustained rise from about t\u2248120 to the end (large endpoint at \u2248 +2.3). STFT there again shows low-frequency content but SHAP red is far weaker than the mid-window block.\",\n    \"Summary of Task 1: the classifier\u2019s positive evidence aligns with a characteristic mid-sequence slow oscillation containing (small hump \u2192 trough \u2192 larger main hump \u2192 faster fall), with dominant energy at the lowest STFT rows and low local volatility inside the bulges.

Overall the series is dominated by large low-frequency swings (broad peaks and troughs) rather than dense high-frequency oscillations.\",\n    \"2) Periodicity & spacing: The major extrema are separated by tens of steps (~30\u201345 steps between major lobes), i.e., low fundamental frequency. There are roughly 2\u20133 broad low-frequency lobes visible across the sequence (early trough, mid double-hump with main peak, late trough and final rise).\",\n    \"3) Volatility and sharpness: Volatility is generally low while the broad lobes evolve (smooth ramps). Transitions downward after major peaks are typically faster (steeper) than the rises, which produces modest mid-frequency content during descents (visible in STFT) but the classifier treats those faster transitions as less positively diagnostic than the slow rises/peaks.\",\n    \"4) Time\u2013feature dependence: The mid-segment pattern (small hump \u2192 deeper trough \u2192 dominant hump \u2192 faster fall) is phase-locked with strong low-frequency energy and is the decisive combination of features for the classifier; the final large endpoint rise is supportive but secondary.\",\n    \"5) STFT confirmation: The STFT shows concentrated spectral magnitude in the very-low-frequency rows during the mid-window where SHAP is positive; higher-frequency rows show weak energy overall and occasional bursts only during the steeper transitions, consistent with the classifier\u2019s focus on coarse contour-scale features.\",\n\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label summaries & scoring (preliminary):\",\n    \"I compared the observed patterns against the provided feature summaries for each label (0..6).

This identifies a single contiguous mid-segment low-frequency pattern as the key contributor.\\n- Corresponding time-series window(s) and detailed features: within the SHAP window the raw trace shows a multi-stage low-frequency bulge: (a) a smooth upward hump centered around t \u2248 48\u201355 (amplitude ~+0.6 to +0.9), (b) a moderate downward leg to about t \u2248 60 (value \u2248 -0.7 to -0.9), then (c) a pronounced broad positive peak centered around t \u2248 70\u201376 (value \u2248 +1.6 to +1.9). The rise into that main mid-peak occurs over ~10\u201315 steps (rough average slope \u2248 +0.12\u2013+0.20 units/step from trough to peak) and is relatively smooth (low local volatility). After the main mid-peak the series falls over ~10\u201315 steps to a negative region around t \u2248 85\u201390 (\u2248 -0.8 to -1.2) and shows a modest rebound by t \u2248 92\u201396.\\n- Shape and substructure (within SHAP window): the mid-segment is asymmetric: a gentler build (longer-duration rise) into the main hump and a somewhat faster fall afterwards. There are no high-amplitude fast oscillations in the red-attributed columns \u2014 local ripples present are small (amplitude \u2248 0.1\u20130.3). Volatility inside the main hump is low; the key discriminative element is the broad, low-frequency, multi-lobe morphology (small hump \u2192 trough \u2192 larger hump \u2192 fall).\\n- STFT corroboration: the STFT image shows concentrated energy in the lowest frequency bins exactly over the same mid time region (\u2248 39\u201396). Higher-frequency bands carry little energy here. This confirms the discriminative feature is a slow (low-frequency), large-scale contour undulation rather than high-frequency texture.\\n\\nTask 2 \u2014 Overall sample-level feature summary and temporal dependence:\\n- Global trend & major extrema: the entire 144-point sequence begins at a high positive level (~+2.3), declines to a deep early trough around t \u2248 25 (~ -1.6), then exhibits the mid-segment structure described above (a modest hump near 48, trough near 60, major hump near 72\u201376, fall to ~85\u201390), followed later by another deep trough near ~115 (\u2248 -1.6) and a strong final rise to the end (t = 143 \u2248 +2.4\u2013+2.5).\\n- Periodicity & frequency content: the series is dominated by very-low-frequency, broad undulations (quasi-periodic lobes roughly every ~30\u201340 steps). The STFT shows that most signal power relevant to classification is at the lowest frequency bins across the mid and end windows; short-period/high-frequency components are weak.\\n- Volatility: volatility is heterogeneous \u2014 low during the broad ramps/peaks (smooth monotonic rises and falls) and higher during the relatively faster transitional segments (e.g., the descent after the main mid-peak and the transitions into late troughs). But overall the discriminative pattern is the slow envelope rather than jitter.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: the classifier attribution (SHAP) treats the mid-window low-frequency multi-lobe as the principal positive evidence; earlier and later large amplitude endpoints also help but less so. The ordering zero-crossing \u2192 small hump \u2192 large hump \u2192 rapid decline (mid window) is a consistent sequence the model uses, i.e., the timing and relative sizes of these broad lobes matter together (not independent single spikes).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to labelled feature summaries and selection of best label:\\n- Comparison with label summaries: the described mid-window strong low-frequency positive attribution (\u2248 t 39\u201395) with a small hump then a larger hump and asymmetric (slower rise, faster fall) morphology matches closely the Label 1 (Eurofighter) pattern in the provided summary. The summary for label 1 specifically emphasizes: strong positive SHAP concentrated near 39\u201395, an ordered mid-segment small hump (~50) followed by a larger hump (~72\u201378) and a faster decline \u2014 exactly what is present in this sample. STFT agreement (low-frequency concentration) and the temporal ordering / asymmetry are also hallmark Label 1 descriptors.\\n- Preliminary label selection: label 1 is the best match.\\n- Scoring of similarity to each label (1..4 scale):\\n  - label 0 (Mirage): 3 \u2014 moderate similarity. Mirage summaries emphasize several low-frequency lobes and some mid-window broad peaks, but the precise mid-window ordering/asymmetry for label 1 (small hump then larger hump near t\u224872) is more characteristic of label 1 than label 0. The sample shares the low-frequency emphasis with label 0 but alignment and substructure are better for label 1.\\n  - label 1 (Eurofighter): 4 \u2014 high similarity. The timing (\u224839\u201395), the two-stage mid hump (small hump then larger hump ~72\u201376) and low-frequency dominance align tightly with label 1 description and the SHAP attribution pattern.\\n  - label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 2 \u2014 low similarity. Label 2 emphasizes different sequences of troughs/peaks (early steep fall + late troughs at specific times). While sample 79 has some troughs, its dominant mid pattern and the precise hump ordering differ enough that similarity is limited.\\n  - label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 2 \u2014 low similarity. Label 3 patterns show different placement and sign of the most positively attributed low-frequency events; the mid-segment positive hump structure seen here is not the primary template for label 3 samples and the provided dissimilar references (label 3) have visibly different mid-segment shapes despite both classes having low-frequency power.\\n  - label 4 (Harrier): 2 \u2014 low similarity. Harrier has a central single dominant hump (\u224852\u201371) that is very large (in provided examples peak \u2248 +2.6).

Their STFTs show the same low-frequency concentration in the mid window and their SHAP heatmaps show the same bottom-row red block around t\u224839\u201396. This strong, consistent match across multiple training exemplars provides robust evidence that the classifier will (and should) assign label 1.\\n- Dissimilar references (samples 39 and 67, label 3) show a different SHAP distribution and different mid-structure; comparing them confirms the discriminative significance of the mid 39\u201396 low-frequency block for label 1 vs. label 3.\\n- Consistency & fairness of scoring: the per-label similarity scores above were determined primarily by (a) alignment of the SHAP-positive low-frequency time window, (b) match of the mid-segment substructure (small hump followed by a larger hump near t\u224872 and faster fall), (c) amplitude ranges and asymmetry, and (d) STFT low-frequency power. Because all four provided similar references are label 1 and match closely, label 1 receives the highest score (4). Other labels get lower scores because although they may share low-frequency content generally, they differ in the exact timing, amplitude, and ordering of mid-segment lobes.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 1 (Eurofighter). Similarity/confidence summary: label 1 = 4 (high similarity). Other labels: label 0 = 3, labels 2/3/4/5/6 = 2 (low similarity).\"\n  ]\n}"

Mapping to the trace: this window contains two low-frequency positive lobes \u2014 a moderate hump centered near t\u224852\u201366 (peak \u2248 +0.8 to +0.95) and the larger dominant hump/peak centered near t\u224875\u201380 (peak \u2248 +1.6 to +1.8). Both events are smooth, low-volatility, and dominated by broad curvature rather than short spikes. STFT confirms the energy for these events is concentrated at the very lowest frequency bins (bottom rows), consistent with SHAP attributing them via low-frequency components.\\n- Feature details for the dominant mid-block (t\u224852\u201391): amplitude, trend and slopes: from the trough preceding the mid-block (around t\u224840 with value \u2248 -0.5) the series slowly rises to the smaller hump (~+0.9) over ~12\u201320 steps (average slope ~+0.04\u2013+0.07 units/step). After a moderate descent to a shallow trough (~t\u224860\u201366), the series then mounts a stronger rise to the main peak at ~t\u224875\u201380 (+1.6 to +1.8). The ascent into the main peak is noticeably faster than earlier rises (moderate slope, roughly +0.08\u2013+0.12 units/step in sub-intervals). The decline after the main peak (t\u224878\u2192~86\u201392) is comparatively steeper (approx -0.15 to -0.30 units/step) and includes slightly more mid-frequency energy in the STFT \u2014 SHAP remains positive at the lowest band across the entire block but shows weaker or mixed values in mid-frequency rows during the faster fall.\\n- Secondary positively-attributed spots: SHAP also shows modest positive low-frequency contributions nearer the end of the sequence (t\u2248130\u2013143) though weaker than the main mid-block. Corresponding trace: a pronounced final rise from roughly t\u2248118 (\u2248-1.4) up to the terminal high \u2248+2.5 at t=143. STFT indicates low-frequency content at the end as well; SHAP gives modest positive weight there, so the model uses that terminal bulge as supporting evidence but the mid-block is the dominant cue.\\n- Negatively/neutral attributed regions to disambiguate: SHAP shows negative (blue) at the lowest frequency during an early interval near t\u224813\u201330. On the trace that corresponds to the large early drop from +2.5 at t\u22480 down to the deep early trough near t\u224825 (\u2248 -1.7). The early steep decline therefore does not contribute positively (and even slightly reduces) the target label score according to SHAP. This helps separate classes where early rise/decline may or may not be informative.\\n- Volatility and substructure: within the positively-attributed mid-block the volatility is low (smooth ramps, broad curvature) except for the sharper descent after the main peak which introduces some mid-frequency energy in STFT and weaker SHAP. Small high-frequency wiggles elsewhere (e.g., around t\u224864\u201368 and t\u2248100) are low amplitude (~0.1\u20130.3) and show little positive SHAP; they are ignored by the classifier as uninformative.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization, periodicity & dependence:\\n- Global shape & major events: The sequence begins very positive (\u2248+2.5 at t0), falls through zero into an early deep trough (\u2248-1.6 to -1.8 around t\u224825), then recovers into the mid-segment where two broad low-frequency positive lobes occur (smaller hump ~t\u224852\u201366 and main hump ~t\u224875\u201380). After the main hump the trace drops toward a mid/late trough (~t\u224886\u201395, slightly negative), shows modest oscillations through t\u2248104, then declines toward another trough around t\u2248115\u2013120 (\u2248 -1.3 to -1.4) before a strong final low-frequency rise to an end peak (~ +2.5 at t=143).\\n- Frequency content & periodicity: STFT shows dominant energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins during the mid-sequence and at the final rise. There is a clear low-frequency envelope composed of roughly two broad cycles (trough\u2192hump\u2192trough\u2192hump\u2192final rise) across the 144 points. Mid-frequency bursts occur during sharper transitions (notably the descent after the main hump) but are not the main carriers of positive attribution.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: The classifier appears to combine multiple separated low-frequency lobes: the middle double-hump (small hump then larger hump) is the decisive pattern, with the final terminal rise providing supporting evidence. The early steep decline is either common across classes or considered counter-evidence here (blue SHAP). This ordering \u2014 early decline, mid small-rise, main mid-rise/peak, steeper fall, and final rise \u2014 is a temporally-ordered motif the model uses.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and label selection (initial):\\n- Compare to label summaries: The mid-segment positive low-frequency double-hump (small hump followed by a larger hump/peak around t\u224872\u201378), concentrated SHAP at the lowest frequencies in roughly the 39\u201395 window, asymmetry (slower build, faster drop) and a supporting late rise are all described as the signature for label 1 (Eurofighter) in the provided label_1 description. The SHAP/time-frequency pattern and the exact time placement of the primary positive attribution (\u224839\u201395) match label 1's prototypical signature nearly exactly.\\n- Contrast with other labels: Label 0 (Mirage) emphasizes strong low-frequency contributions too but for label 0 the strongest positive blocks were especially around early-mid windows like 13\u201330 and mid/late; also label 0 descriptions emphasize slow upward ramps from early troughs as main driver. Our sample's strongest positive SHAP is centered later (\u224852\u201391) and matches label 1's asymmetrical mid-cycle more closely. Labels 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 each have different timing and shape emphases (e.g., label 2 and 3 show multiple deep troughs at different positions; label 4 centers a dominant mid hump but at different relative timing/asymmetry; label 5 and 6 have other subtle differences) \u2014 none match the combination of a smaller mid hump then a larger asymmetric hump ~72 and concentrated SHAP in 39\u201395 as well as label 1 does.\\n- Initial conclusion: highest match \u2192 label 1 (Eurofighter).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference examples and final scoring:\\n- Reference samples 36, 40 and 86 (all labeled 1) show extremely similar trace morphology: big positive start, early deep trough around t\u224825, a mid double-hump with a larger peak around t\u224870\u201380, and a terminal rise; their STFTs and SHAP maps likewise concentrate positive attribution at the lowest frequencies in the same mid window. The tested sample (94) shares these same time-located low-frequency lobes, amplitude ranges for the mid/main hump (+0.6\u2013+1.8), asymmetric rise/fall behavior in the midblock, and a supportive late terminal rise \u2014 matching the reference examples closely in both time-domain and time-frequency/SHAP signatures.\\n- Reference sample 83 (label 0) is visually close in some respects (both have multiple low-frequency lobes) but its SHAP and timing emphases differ slightly: label 0 explanation stresses strong positive blocks earlier (e.g., 13\u201330) and slightly different ordering of lobes. In our sample early-low-frequency mass is actually negatively attributed (blue SHAP) so label 0 is a weaker match.\\n- Dissimilar examples (labels 3) show different mid-block substructure and stronger low-frequency at different time positions; their SHAP maps also highlight alternate time windows, so they are not good matches.\\n\\nFinal decision and similarity scoring logic:\\n- Given the near one-to-one correspondence between the sample's dominant positively-attributed low-frequency mid-block (39\u201395), the presence of the two-step mid-structure (small hump then larger hump peaking ~75\u201380), the asymmetry (gradual build, faster fall), and supporting late rise, the match to label 1 is high. Reference label-1 examples 36, 40, 86 reinforce this conclusion \u2014 all three share nearly identical timing, STFT low-frequency concentration and SHAP localization.\\n- Score rationale: Using the provided 1\u20134 rubric, the sample meets the \u201cHigh similarity\u201d criteria relative to label 1: there is an explicit feature description in the label_1 summary that maps closely to the sample, and the plots and SHAP/STFT of the provided label-1 reference samples are almost consistent with sample 94.

Change rate and volatility: moderate slope (\u2248 +0.03\u2013+0.08 units/step averaged in this subwindow) with low local volatility (no sharp oscillations). STFT: low-frequency energy concentrated in bottom bins during this window.\",\n    \"  - Window B (approx. t \u2248 56\u201380, core positive region): A larger, dominant low-frequency bulge with an asymmetric profile \u2014 a stronger ascent into a major peak around t\u224872\u201380 (peak amplitude \u2248 +1.6 to +1.8) followed by a comparatively faster decline. Measured slopes: the ascent from trough to peak is gradual (moderate slope \u2248 +0.05 units/step over ~10\u201315 steps), the subsequent fall is noticeably steeper (approx. -0.15 to -0.25 units/step over ~10\u201312 steps). Volatility: low within the rise and peak (smooth), small mid-frequency energy appears during the sharper fall. STFT: concentrated energy at the very-low-frequency bins here, matching the SHAP attribution.\",\n    \"  - Window C (approx. t \u2248 80\u201395): The signal exhibits a relatively fast drop from the main peak down to a trough near t\u224886\u201392 (amplitude near -0.6 to -1.1), followed by a small rebound/hump by ~95 (amplitude \u2248 +0.2 to +0.5). This transition contains some mid-frequency content (steeper changes) but SHAP still gives net positive weight in the lowest-frequency band earlier in the window.\",\n    \"3) Later weaker positive area (t \u2248 104\u2013130): The series later has a negative trough around t\u2248110\u2013120 (\u2248 -1.4 to -1.6) followed by a sustained, strong terminal rise from ~130 to 143 ending at \u2248 +2.4\u2013+2.6. SHAP shows modest low-frequency positive contribution near the end but weaker than the mid-window block. STFT again shows low-frequency energy for that final rise.\",\n    \"4) Interpretation: The classifier is rewarding broad, slow, low-frequency bulges located in the mid-sequence (especially the two-stage hump: modest hump then larger hump) and penalizes high-frequency / sharp noise. The STFT supports that the positively attributed events are dominated by very low-frequency bands.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Task 2 \u2014 Global/overall time-series characterization and dependence of features:\",\n    \"1) Trend & large-scale shape: The sample is dominated by slow, large-scale undulations (low-frequency envelope) across the full 144 points: an initial high at the start followed by a long descent and trough (t\u224813\u201330), a mid-sequence two-stage positive structure (modest hump then major hump around t\u224852 and t\u224872\u201380), a faster mid-late drop, a late deep trough (\u2248100\u2013120), and a strong terminal rise to a large positive endpoint (~143 \u2248 +2.4\u20132.6).\",\n    \"2) Periodicity & frequency content: The STFT shows most energy concentrated in the bottom (very-low-frequency) rows during the key windows (start, mid, end). There is quasi-periodic, slow oscillation (roughly two to three broad low-frequency lobes across the series) rather than repeated high-frequency cycles. Localized mid-frequency energy appears during steeper transitions (notably the fast fall after the main mid peak and the rapid final rise), but these mid-frequency bursts are smaller relative to the dominant DC/very-low-frequency content.\",\n    \"3) Volatility & substructure: Volatility is heterogeneous \u2014 low (smooth monotonic ramps) during the broad bulges and troughs, higher (shorter mid-frequency content) confined to transition regions where the slope changes faster. The mid-sequence pattern exhibits clear substructure: a smaller positive bump followed by a larger positive bulge then a faster decline; that ordered sequence is central to the classifier's positive attribution pattern.\",\n    \"4) Temporal dependence & combination: The discriminative evidence is not a single isolated event but the ordered combination: modest mid-hump \u2192 larger mid-peak \u2192 faster descent \u2192 later trough and final rise. The mid-window sequence (timing and asymmetry between the two mid-humps) is treated as a key motif by the model (supported by SHAP concentration there).\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Task 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and selection of highest-match label:\",\n    \"1) Compare to label summaries (high-level):\",\n    \"  - Label 1 (Eurofighter): The provided label_1 summary explicitly lists strong positive SHAP in the lowest frequency rows between ~39 and ~95, with a small hump near ~48\u201355 followed by a larger hump near ~72\u201378, asymmetric (slower rise, faster fall) mid-window, and some late upward trend sometimes supporting classification. This matches the sample very closely in time placement, amplitude pattern (modest then major mid-humps), asymmetry (slower build, faster fall), STFT low-frequency dominance, and the terminal rise.\",\n    \"  - Label 0 (Mirage), label 2 (F-14 closed), label 4 (Harrier), label 5 (F-22) and label 6 (F-15): All emphasize low-frequency bulges in different time locations and patterns.

The mid-window alignment of SHAP red, the two-stage mid hump pattern, the asymmetric rise/fall, and the smaller/secondary late contribution strongly mirror the label_1 description.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Task 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final confidence scoring:\",\n    \"1) Review similar reference samples: The four similar references shown are three labeled 1 (samples 36, 40, 86) and one labeled 0 (sample 83). The three label-1 references show nearly identical mid-window structure (small hump ~50 then larger hump ~72\u201380) and SHAP concentration in the same lowest-frequency rows \u2014 they match sample 94 visually and spectrally. The label-0 example is similar in some respects but its SHAP and subtle shape differences make it less consistent than the label-1 examples.\",\n    \"2) Review dissimilar reference samples: The two dissimilar examples (labels 3.0) show different mid-sequence signatures and more fragmented SHAP patterns (and different timing of positive bands). They do not match sample 94 as well.\",\n    \"3) Fairness and consistency check: The explicit items used for scoring were: timing of positive SHAP (39\u201395), presence of the two-stage mid hump, amplitude ranges (modest hump \u2248 +0.6\u20130.9, main hump \u2248 +1.6\u20131.8), asymmetry (slower rise, faster fall), low-frequency STFT energy \u2014 all present and matching the label_1 reference descriptions. No contradictory strong pattern from other labels appears in SHAP or STFT that would favor a different label.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Final decision and similarity score justification:\",\n    \"  - Final predicted label: label 1 (Eurofighter).\",\n    \"  - Similarity score (to chosen label): 4 (high similarity). Rationale: The sample\u2019s mid-window SHAP concentration, the two-stage mid humps with amplitudes and timing matching the label_1 summary, the asymmetric rise/fall behavior, and the STFT low-frequency energy correspond very closely to the label_1 prototypical pattern and to multiple provided label-1 reference samples.

Change rate: large negative slope over ~12\u201318 steps (average \u2248 \u22120.15 to \u22120.25 units/step). Volatility inside the trough is low (smooth U-shaped valley). STFT shows strong energy at the lowest frequency bin here. SHAP red on low-frequency rows indicates this broad early descent + trough is a positive cue for the class.\",\n    \"   * Mid block (t \u2248 48\u201378): the signal shows a smooth rise from negative toward modest positive peaks around t\u224848\u201355 (~+0.7\u2013+0.9), then a modest fall and another moderate rise around t\u224865\u201375 (peaks ~+0.5\u2013+0.8). These mid humps are low-volatility, low-frequency broad lobes (rise/fall over ~10\u201320 steps). STFT energy again concentrated in the bottom rows and SHAP low-frequency rows are strongly positive over much of this interval, indicating the classifier treats these broad mid-sequence humps as supportive features.\",\n    \"   * Late block (t \u2248 100\u2013130): the series descends again into a wide trough near t\u2248110\u2013118 (amplitude \u2248 \u22121.3 to \u22121.6) and then recovers with a smooth, fairly steep final rise from ~t\u2248125 to the end (t=143) up to ~+2.6.

The classifier thus values the late trough+recovery pair as additional positive evidence.\",\n    \" - Frequency/volatility specifics: across all three SHAP-positive blocks the STFT shows the dominant power at the very-low-frequency bins (bottom rows) and little mid/high-frequency energy; local small wiggles (amplitude ~0.1\u20130.3) appear between major lobes but carry negligible SHAP weight.

There are about two full large-scale oscillation cycles visible: an early big descent to trough, a mid-section of alternating broad humps/troughs, and a late trough followed by a terminal strong rise.\\n- Trend & endpoints: A high positive start (~+2.7) followed by a deep early trough (~-1.5), then mid recovery to modest positive peaks (~+0.6\u2013+0.8), a late deep trough (~-1.4 to -1.6), and a final large positive endpoint (~+2.7). The start and end amplitudes are comparable and large.\\n- Periodicity & rhythmicity: Quasi-periodic low-frequency cycles with spacing roughly 30\u201350 time steps between large extrema. Not strictly periodic but phase-consistent: the early trough precedes the mid humps, which precede the late trough and final rise \u2014 the ordering and spacing are stable and likely used as discriminative sequence features.\\n- Volatility: Low within broad lobes (smooth ramps), occasional increases in instantaneous slope during transitions e.g., initial descent and final climb.

The test sample shows multiple separated low-frequency lobes (early trough + two mid humps + late trough + final rise) that align best with label 2's described multi-block pattern.\\n  * Label 3 (F-14 wings opened) also emphasizes large low-frequency features but the label-3 patterns differ in the arrangement and sign of some lobes (and their SHAP distribution) compared with this sample; the training reference images for label 3 (dissimilar samples) show different mid-sequence structure and overall waveform shape.\\n\\n- Selection: Highest matching degree is label 2 (F-14 wings closed).\\n- Quantified similarity to each label (1\u20134 scale):\\n  * label 0: 2 \u2014 some low-frequency lobes like those described for Mirage are present, but the exact timing/ordering (early steep fall + mid-two-hump + late trough + strong terminal rise) is not a close match to the label-0 examples.\\n  * label 1: 2 \u2014 there is a mid low-frequency oscillation, but label-1 emphasizes a single dominant asymmetric mid-cycle and different attribution distribution; the sample contains additional early steep fall and terminal rise features that label-1 does not prioritize.\\n  * label 2: 4 \u2014 high similarity. The early steep fall into a wide trough near t\u224825\u201330, the pair of mid low-frequency humps, the late trough around t\u2248100\u2013125, and the final large rise align strongly with the label-2 pattern and with the provided similar reference examples.\\n  * label 3: 1 \u2014 although label 3 is also an F-14 subtype, its reference patterns show different mid/late shape and SHAP spreads; the sample matches label-3 less well than label-2.\\n  * label 4: 2 \u2014 label-4 expects a dominant single central bump (Harrier) which is not the dominant single feature here; test sample has multiple lobes.\\n  * label 5: 2 \u2014 F-22 references have mid humps but usually different amplitude/time placement and fewer of the exact consecutive low-frequency trough/hump/tough/final-rise sequence seen here.\\n  * label 6: 2 \u2014 F-15 pattern emphasizes persistent low-frequency envelope across middle but penalizes sharper mid-frequency transitions; while the test shares some features, the ordering and the pronounced early trough + twin mid humps + late trough + final rise align better with label 2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples and consistency verification:\\n- The four 'similar' reference samples included (Samples 54, 95, 51, 30) are all labelled 2 and their plots, STFTs and SHAP maps are visually nearly identical to the test sample: (i) large positive start, (ii) steep early fall to wide trough at \u2248t=25\u201330, (iii) mid double-hump structure at \u224840\u201380 with low-frequency energy, (iv) late trough \u2248100\u2013120 and (v) strong final rise to high positive endpoint. The SHAP low-frequency red blocks line up in the same time windows. This close match strongly validates assigning label 2 with high confidence.\\n- The two dissimilar references (both label 3) show markedly different mid/late substructure and their SHAP heatmaps have more distributed/heterogeneous attributions across frequencies; these differ visibly from the test sample and the label-2 references.\\n- The scoring logic and final label are consistent: the test sample captures the distinctive multi-block low-frequency signature described for label 2, and all four provided similar training examples are label 2, so assigning label 2 with a high similarity score of 4 is appropriate.\\n\\nFinal conclusion: The time-series' low-frequency, temporally-ordered pattern (early steep descent to broad trough ~t=25\u201330, two mid-section broad humps ~t=39\u201378, late trough ~t=100\u2013120, and a strong final rise to \u2248+2.7) matches the label-2 (F-14 wings closed) pattern very closely.

Mapping those red low-frequency blocks to the time plot gives the following precise local features: (a) Early trough block ~t \u2248 13\u201330: the series falls from ~0 (near t=13) down to a wide trough around t\u224824\u201328 with amplitude about -1.4 to -1.6. The change is smooth (low volatility) and the STFT confirms energy concentrated at the very lowest frequency here. (b) Mid / early\u2011late positive block ~t \u2248 36\u201378 (two adjacent low-frequency lobes): the trace rises from the trough through a broad hump peaking near t\u224842\u201348 (~+0.7\u2013+0.8), dips slightly, then rises again to a second broad hump near t\u224864\u201375 (peak ~+0.6\u2013+0.8). Both humps are low-volatility, slow (slope of order +0.05\u2013+0.15 units/step on rises), and STFT shows these events dominate the bottom frequency bin. (c) Late trough + final rise block ~t \u2248 100\u2013130 and terminal rise ~t \u2248 125\u2013143: the series drops smoothly into another wide trough centered ~t\u2248108\u2013116 (amplitude ~-1.4 to -1.6) then executes a sustained, relatively fast final climb from ~t\u2248125 to the endpoint (t=143) reaching about +2.7. The late trough and final large low-frequency endpoint rise are also strongly represented in the STFT low-frequency energy and in SHAP red at the bottom rows. In all red-highlighted windows higher-frequency rows are pale/neutral (STFT and SHAP confirm minimal mid/high-frequency power), indicating the model relies on broad slow curvature rather than short spikes.\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 overall time-series characterization and temporal dependence: The series is dominated by low-frequency, multi-lobe structure across the full 144 points: (i) a large positive starting offset (~+2.7 at t=0) followed by a steep low-frequency descent into an early wide trough (~t=13\u201330), (ii) two separated low-frequency positive humps in the central region (approx. t\u224840\u201348 and t\u224864\u201375), (iii) a mid-late deep trough (~t\u2248104\u2013116), and (iv) a strong terminal rise to a high positive endpoint. Volatility is low inside the broad lobes and troughs; localized higher-frequency, small-amplitude wiggles occur in the middle but carry little spectral energy and negligible positive SHAP. The features are temporally ordered and phase-linked (early descent \u2192 mid paired humps \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise) \u2014 the model appears to use the timing and repetition of these broad low-frequency lobes as a composite signature rather than any single isolated spike.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 mapping sample features to label summaries (selection of best matching label): Comparing the extracted features to the seven label summaries, the pattern matches label 2 (F\u201114 wings closed) most closely. Evidence for label 2: the label_2 summary emphasizes three main low-frequency time blocks (early large descent into a wide trough at ~t\u224813\u201326, mid positive humps ~t\u224836\u201352 and ~t\u224865\u201391, and a late deep trough and recovery ~t\u2248100\u2013125 followed by a final rise). The sample shows those same windows, amplitudes (troughs \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6 and mid-humps \u2248 +0.6 to +0.8), low volatility within lobes, and strong SHAP positive attribution at the very-low-frequency rows in the same time ranges.

(label 4: 2) Harrier is dominated by a single large mid hump \u2014 sample has multiple humps and late trough that Harrier descriptions do not prioritize. (label 5: 3) F-22 has mid-sequence positive humps and strong low-frequency content too, so there is moderate similarity, but F-22 typically places more emphasis on a single dominant mid-hump and endpoint patterns differ slightly.

Their STFTs and SHAP maps match the sample: strong low-frequency energy and red SHAP at the bottom rows in the same time windows. The two 'dissimilar' references (label 3) show visibly different mid-structure and broader SHAP activation across frequencies in places, consistent with their lower similarity. This reinforces the correctness of assigning label 2 to the test sample and supports the high similarity score (4) assigned to label 2.

These blocks map to the following intervals in the time-series plot (approximate indices taken from axis ticks): (A) early window ~t=10\u201330, (B) mid window(s) ~t=38\u201380 (two low-frequency lobes inside this region), and (C) late window ~t=100\u2013143 (positive attribution on the final rise). Higher-frequency rows are neutral or slightly negative in parts.\\n- Block A (\u2248 t=10\u201330): In the line plot the signal falls from a large positive starting level (~+2.6\u2013+2.8 at t=0) through zero near t\u224813 to a broad trough around t\u224825\u201330 (min \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6). Manifestation: a large-amplitude, smooth monotonic descent (low volatility inside the descent), strong low-frequency energy in STFT (bright bottom rows), and the SHAP low-frequency band is strongly positive in this interval. Change rate: average slope roughly -0.15 to -0.25 units/step across the descent. Shape/substructure: single smooth long-wavelength downward ramp (no sharp spikes). Implication: this broad early drop is an important positive cue to the classifier.\\n- Block B (\u2248 t=38\u201380): The time series climbs from the early trough into a smooth positive hump near t\u224842\u201350 (peak \u2248 +0.7\u2013+0.8), then descends slightly and rises again to another mid positive lobe around t\u224864\u201375 (peak ~+0.6\u2013+0.8). These are low-volatility, low-frequency bulges (STFT energy concentrated at the bottom rows), and the SHAP low-frequency rows are strongly positive during the rises and peaks. There are small higher-frequency wiggles superimposed in some sub-intervals (tiny amplitude ~0.1\u20130.3), but SHAP treats those as neutral. Change rates: moderate upward ramps (~+0.05\u2013+0.12 units/step) into the humps, slower falls between them. Shape: two separated broad lobes (smaller then larger), ordered in time.\\n- Block C (\u2248 t=100\u2013143): The series again falls into a wide late trough (min \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6 around t\u2248110\u2013115) then undergoes a strong, smooth final rise to a high endpoint (~+2.7 at t=143). STFT shows renewed low-frequency energy at the end and SHAP bottom-row attribution is positive for the final rise. The final rise is fairly steep compared with earlier ramps (average slope ~+0.15\u2013+0.2 units/step) but still dominated by low-frequency content in STFT. Volatility in this final segment remains low (smooth ramp).\\n- Frequency corroboration: The STFT confirms that the energy associated with the three SHAP-positive windows is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins (bottom rows), supporting the interpretation that broad, slow contour features (not sharp, high-frequency details) drive positive classification evidence.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series features and temporal dependence:\\n- Global structure: The trace is dominated by a multi-lobe, low-frequency envelope: early high baseline \u2192 steep smooth descent to an early trough \u2192 two mid-sequence broad humps \u2192 a deep late trough \u2192 a final strong broad rise to a high endpoint. This is a quasi-periodic, long-wavelength pattern with roughly 1\u20133 broad oscillation cycles over 144 samples (extrema spaced ~30\u201350 steps apart).\\n- Periodicity & frequency: Energy concentrates at very low frequencies (STFT bright in bottom rows during the major events). Small high-frequency components exist transiently (small wiggles around mid windows) but contribute little positive SHAP weight.\\n- Volatility & change-rate differences: Volatility is low within broad lobes (smooth ramps), with higher instantaneous slopes during the initial drop and final rise. Mid-sequence rises are moderate in slope and mostly smooth. Small local oscillations are low amplitude and treated neutrally by SHAP.\\n- Temporal dependence: The ordering of events (early descent \u2192 mid humps \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise) is salient: SHAP positive blocks align with those specific time positions, indicating the classifier relies on both timing and shape of broad contour features rather than undifferentiated amplitude.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and selection:\\n- Comparison to label_2 (F-14 wings closed): The label_2 summary describes: (1) an early large positive start followed by a steep decline into a wide trough (~t=0\u201335), (2) a mid positive hump (~36\u201352), (3) another later positive hump (~65\u201391), (4) a pronounced late negative trough (~100\u2013125) and (5) a rapid final rise to a large positive endpoint (~125\u2013143). The test sample shows these same five elements with strong low-frequency energy and matching timing/ordering. SHAP and STFT align with the same low-frequency windows. Visual similarity to several provided reference samples labelled 2.0 is high. Therefore label_2 is the best match.\\n- Comparison to other labels: Label_0 (Mirage), label_1 (Eurofighter), label_4 (Harrier), label_5 (F-22), label_6 (F-15) summaries emphasize different mid-window shapes or different asymmetries and should show different timing/amplitude patterns. Label_3 (F-14 wings opened) also has large low-frequency lobes but its summary emphasizes different relative timings and mid-sequence structure (and the provided dissimilar reference samples for label_3 show visibly different finer structure and broader SHAP distribution across frequencies). The test sample most closely matches the label_2 description.\\n- Chosen label and similarity score: I select label 2 (F-14 wings closed) with high similarity. Score = 4 (high similarity): test sample's major low-frequency events, their timing, amplitudes, slopes, and SHAP-attributed frequency bands match the label_2 feature description and the four provided reference examples for label 2 nearly exactly.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- Visual check against similar reference samples (Samples 54, 95, 51, 30; all labeled 2.0): The line plots are essentially the same waveform: large positive start, steep fall to an early trough near t\u224825\u201330, two mid positive humps (~40\u201350 and ~65\u201375), deep trough around t\u2248110, and final rise to a large positive endpoint. The STFT patterns (low-frequency energy concentrated in the same time windows) and SHAP low-frequency positive blocks are also highly consistent between the test sample and these references. This strongly confirms the classification.\\n- Contrast with dissimilar references (Samples 102 and 59; labeled 3.0): Those have more prominent positive mid-peaks at different positions, more distributed SHAP activation across frequencies and time, and slight differences in substructure; they do not match as closely as the label-2 references. That supports rejecting label_3 for this sample.\\n- Fairness and scoring logic: Scoring is based on match of (a) presence/absence of the same set of major low-frequency events, (b) relative timing of extrema, (c) comparable amplitudes of peaks/troughs and slope characteristics, and (d) consistent STFT/SHAP low-frequency attribution. The test sample meets all of these conditions relative to label_2 references and label_2 feature summary; therefore a high similarity score (4) is justified.\\n\\nConclusion: The sample is classified as label 2 (F-14 wings closed) with high confidence (similarity score = 4) because its multi-stage low-frequency contour (early descent to a broad trough, two mid low-frequency humps, a pronounced late trough and a final large low-frequency rise), STFT energy concentration, and SHAP attribution pattern closely match label_2's prototypical signature and the provided label-2 reference samples.\"\n    ]\n}"

The raw trace climbs from roughly 0 (or slightly negative) to a local positive peak near +0.7\u2013+0.9 around t \u2248 45\u201352.\\n  - Amplitude & trend: rise \u2248 +1.4 to +1.7 units over ~12\u201316 steps; average slope \u2248 +0.09\u2013+0.15 units/step; rise is relatively smooth with little high-frequency jitter.\\n  - Volatility & shape: low volatility within the hump (broad convex shape), STFT shows concentrated energy at lowest frequencies during the hump.\\n  - Role: strong positive contributor per SHAP \u2014 a characteristic low-frequency bulge.\\n\\n- Feature C (mid-late positive excursion and the SHAP intensity peak):\\n  - Time range: ~t = 64\u201396 (this region shows the highest SHAP intensity in the lowest-frequency rows; STFT also shows reinforced low-frequency magnitude here).\\n  - Manifestation in raw trace: one or two modest positive lobes/oscillations (peaks around +0.4 to +0.8) separated by shallow troughs; overall the section shows slow low-frequency variation rather than fast spikes.\\n  - Volatility & frequency: low volatility (dominant low-frequency content). The SHAP heatmap is deepest in this block meaning the classifier relies on these slow lobes as decisive evidence.\\n\\n- Feature D (late trough then strong final rise; SHAP still positive at low frequency):\\n  - Time range: ~t = 100\u2013143. The trace shows a broad negative trough centered near t \u2248 104\u2013115 (min around \u22121.4 to \u22121.6) and then a strong monotonic final rise from that trough up to ~+2.6 at the last time step.\\n  - Amplitude & trend: trough-to-end rise \u2248 +4.0 units over ~30\u201340 steps (avg slope \u2248 +0.10\u2013+0.16 units/step), final rise is smoother and dominated by low-frequency energy per STFT.\\n  - Volatility & shape: the trough is wide (low volatility within), recovery is smooth. SHAP assigns moderate-to-strong positive weight at the lowest frequency rows across the recovery.\\n\\n- Frequency confirmation (STFT): Across all SHAP-positive windows the STFT has strong energy in the bottom frequency rows and little energy at higher frequencies. Higher-frequency rows show low magnitude and correspond to neutral/weak SHAP. This confirms the classifier is using slow, large-scale contour features (broad lobes/troughs) rather than short spikes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall/time-series-level description and combination of features:\\n- Global shape: The series is dominated by large slow oscillations (low-frequency) arranged in a consistent temporal order: an initial high value \u2192 steep early decline to a wide trough (~t\u224825) \u2192 mid-sequence recovery to one or two broad humps (~t\u224840\u201390) \u2192 another broad trough (~t\u2248104\u2013115) \u2192 smooth strong final rise to a high endpoint (~t=143). This yields roughly two full large-scale valley\u2192peak cycles across the 144 points.\\n- Periodicity & frequency content: Quasi-periodic at long time scale (period roughly 40\u201360 time steps between major extrema). STFT confirms most energy below ~0.05 (lowest bins). High-frequency content is minimal except small localized wiggles which the SHAP map treats as neutral.\\n- Volatility & transitions: Low volatility inside broad lobes (smooth ramps). The steepest local slopes occur during the initial drop and the final recovery, but they are still dominated by low-frequency energy (not noisy spikes). Mid-sequence contains small-amplitude oscillations but these are low-power and not emphasized by SHAP.\\n- Temporal dependence & classifier view: The model appears to combine separated low-frequency lobes additively \u2014 presence and timing of the early trough, the mid humps, and the late trough+recovery together contribute to the predicted class. Ordering matters: early trough then mid hump(s) then late trough then final rise is the distinctive sequence.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label feature summaries and initial match selection:\\n- Compare with provided label summaries: The described pattern matches the label_2 (F-14 wings closed) description closely: label_2 summary explicitly lists (1) early steep fall into a wide trough around t\u224813\u201335, (2) a mid positive hump around t\u224836\u201352, (3) another positive hump around t\u224865\u201391, (4) late deep trough around t\u2248100\u2013125 and a final rise to a large positive endpoint. The timing, amplitudes, low-frequency dominance, and SHAP localization are essentially the same.\\n- Therefore the best-matching label is label 2 (F-14 wings closed). I assign the highest similarity to label 2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Similarity scoring (per-label) used to verify the decision (1\u20134 scale):\\n- label 0 (Mirage): 3 (moderate). Mirage samples emphasize low-frequency broad lobes and several large-scale peaks/troughs; some similarity exists (low-frequency dominance, multi-lobe structure) but timing/relative amplitudes differ from sample 9 and the specific mid/late timing alignment is closer to label 2.\\n- label 1 (Eurofighter): 2 (low). Eurofighter emphasizes a dominant mid-cycle asymmetric hump as the decisive feature. While sample 9 has mid humps, the clear early trough + late trough + final strong endpoint pattern aligns better with label 2 than label 1.\\n- label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 4 (high). Nearly all characteristic points from the label_2 description are present in sample 9: early steep decline to wide trough at ~25, mid humps at 36\u201391, late trough at ~104\u2013120, and strong final rise; low-frequency attribution aligns with SHAP; reference examples provided are visually nearly identical.\\n- label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 2 (low). Although same aircraft family, label_3 descriptions emphasize different arrangement of negative pulses and positive pulses and the reference dissimilar samples have different SHAP patterns and more pronounced mid-high frequency features; sample 9 matches wings-closed pattern more closely.\\n- label 4 (Harrier): 2 (low). Harrier descriptions focus on one dominant central large positive hump (t\u224852\u201371) as the decisive feature; sample 9 does not have a single dominant central hump of that amplitude and shape.\\n- label 5 (F-22): 2 (low). F-22 patterns show different mid-hump shapes and smaller mid-late lobes; sample 9\u2019s sequence of two troughs and final strong endpoint is more consistent with label_2.\\n- label 6 (F-15): 2 (low). F-15 descriptions emphasize a different low-frequency envelope and penalties for mid-frequency sharp transitions; while both have low-frequency energy, the precise temporal arrangement (early trough + two mid humps + late trough + final rise) is not the canonical F-15 pattern in the summary.\\n\\nCross-check with the provided reference samples:\\n- The four similar training samples shown are all labeled 2 and their raw plots/STFT/SHAP maps are visually almost identical to sample 9 (same early drop to trough near t\u224825, same mid humps, same late trough and final rise; SHAP concentrated in lowest-frequency rows at corresponding times). The two dissimilar references (label 3) have visibly different time-series morphology (different mid-sequence shapes, more distributed SHAP across frequencies) and do not match sample 9. This strongly reinforces the assignment to label 2.\\n\\nFinal decision and confidence:\\n- Predicted label: label 2 (F-14 wings closed).\\n- Similarity score for chosen label: 4 (high similarity). The decision is supported by detailed alignment of timing, amplitude, low-frequency STFT energy, SHAP localization, and the provided label_2 feature description and near-identical training reference examples.\"\n  ]\n}",

I therefore inspected the time-series in those windows and the STFT to characterize local features precisely:\",\n    \"  - Early block (t \u2248 0\u201330): The series starts very high (~+2.6 at t=0) then falls smoothly and monotonically to a deep trough (\u2248 -1.4 to -1.6) centered near t\u224825\u201330. The change is large (\u0394 \u2248 -3.8), the descent is low-volatility and dominated by low-frequency content in the STFT.

I map these to the trace and describe each precisely:\\n  1) Early window (approx. t \u2248 10\u201330, strongest around t\u224813\u201326): the trace falls from a large positive start (~+2.7 at t=0) down through ~0 by t\u224813 and into a wide, smooth trough near t\u224825\u201328 with amplitude about -1.4 to -1.6. Change is monotonic and relatively steep over ~20\u201325 steps (average slope ~ -0.12 to -0.22 units/step during the initial descent). Volatility inside the trough is low (smooth bottoming, few high-frequency wiggles). STFT: concentrated energy at the very lowest frequency bins in the same window, confirming this is a long-wavelength feature. SHAP: strong positive attribution at the lowest-frequency rows exactly here, so the model uses this broad early valley as positive evidence.\\n  2) Mid window(s) (approx. t \u2248 36\u201356 and t \u2248 60\u201378 with strongest around t\u224839\u201352 and again \u224865\u201378): two separated low-frequency positive humps. First mid hump: rise from near 0 (around t\u224838\u201340) to a modest peak near +0.6\u2013+0.8 by t\u224845\u201352, then a descent to a trough (around t\u224855\u201360) \u2014 smooth, low volatility, width ~10\u201316 steps. Second mid hump: another smooth rise to ~+0.7\u2013+0.8 near t\u224865\u201370, again dominated by low-frequency content. STFT: low-frequency energy concentrated in these mid windows; SHAP: red concentrated at the same lowest-frequency rows for both humps. The humps are broad (low-frequency) and have moderate slopes (rise over ~8\u201312 steps) with little high-frequency jitter.\\n  3) Late window & endpoint (approx. t \u2248 100\u2013125 trough then t \u2248 125\u2013143 final rise): a wide late trough centered near t\u2248105\u2013115 (min ~ -1.4 to -1.6) followed by a relatively fast recovery and a strong final rise to a high endpoint (~+2.7 at t=143). The late trough is smooth and wide (low volatility inside), and the final rise is fairly steep (average slope ~+0.15 to +0.2 units/step in the last ~20 steps). STFT again shows low-frequency energy here; SHAP shows positive attribution for low-frequency bins around the late trough/recovery region (less strong than the earliest red block but present). \\n- Across all these SHAP-red time windows, the STFT confirms the discriminative content is almost entirely in the lowest frequency bins (broad contour/shape components) while mid/high-frequency bands show little energy and are neutral or slightly negative in SHAP. High-frequency jitter in a few short windows (e.g., around t\u224870\u201390 small ripples) carries little positive attribution.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Trend & periodicity: The series shows quasi-periodic, low-frequency undulations (broad trough \u2192 hump \u2192 trough \u2192 hump \u2192 trough \u2192 final rise) rather than high-frequency oscillation. There are roughly 2\u20133 large low-frequency cycles across 144 points. The dominant energy is at the very lowest STFT bins, indicating long-wavelength contour structure.\\n- Volatility: Low within broad humps/troughs (smooth monotonic rises/falls), with occasional localized short high-frequency wiggles that are low amplitude and have little influence on SHAP.\\n- Slopes & asymmetry: Early descent is relatively steep, mid-humps have more gradual rises and sometimes faster falls (asymmetry present), and the final rise is relatively rapid compared with the mid-humps. These asymmetric ramps (slow/gradual bulges vs. faster transitions) are consistent across the series.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: The classifier appears to combine several temporally separated low-frequency events (early deep trough, repeated mid humps, late trough + final rise). The ordering matters: an early high-to-low descent into a deep trough followed by mid humps and then a late trough/recovery followed by a terminal rise forms a composite signature. This sample shows that exact sequence of low-frequency lobes with matching timing and amplitude relationships.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match against label feature lists and selection of best label:\\n- Label 2 (F-14 wings closed) feature summary emphasizes: an early large downward ramp into a wide trough around t~13\u201335, mid-sequence positive humps around t~36\u201352 and t~65\u201391, a later large negative trough around t~100\u2013125 and final recovery to a large positive endpoint. It also stresses low-frequency dominance and that the classifier uses those temporally aligned low-frequency humps/troughs. This description maps almost exactly to the observed features of Sample 11 (amplitudes, time ranges, low volatility, STFT agreement, and SHAP attribution). High concordance.\\n- Other labels: many labels (0,1,3,4,5,6) also rely on low-frequency energy, but their characteristic temporal arrangements differ. For example, labels 0/1 emphasize different timing and shapes of the dominant bulges (e.g., label 1 emphasizes a dominant mid asymmetric cycle and often downplays the late recovery), label 3 (F-14 wings opened) shows multiple separated negative lobes but with different timing/shape patterns in reference samples, and labels 4/5/6 have different primary hump positions and asymmetries. The provided reference dissimilar samples are labeled 3 and show different mid-late positive/negative arrangements and SHAP patterns (more spread across frequencies). Sample 11 aligns best with label 2\u2019s canonical multi-lobe trough\u2013hump\u2013hump\u2013trough\u2013rise signature.\\n- Therefore the top predicted label is label 2 (F-14 wings closed). Similarity rating: high (4) because the sample\u2019s exact temporal locations of deep early trough, two mid humps, late trough and final rise plus low-frequency STFT energy closely match the label-2 feature list and the provided label-2 reference plots.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples:\\n- The four provided 'similar' reference samples are all labelled 2 and their plots/STFT/SHAP are essentially the same shape as Sample 11: large positive start, steep descent to a broad trough near t\u224825\u201330, mid humps near t\u224840\u201355 and ~65\u201380, later deep trough near t\u2248105\u2013115, and final rise to a large positive endpoint. Their SHAP maps also concentrate red attribution in the same low-frequency rows and time windows. Visual and spectral agreement is strong. Differences between Sample 11 and the four label-2 references are minimal (slight amplitude variation in mid humps), well within expected within-class variation.\\n- The two dissimilar references (label 3) show more distributed SHAP across frequencies and different mid-sequence shapes (their SHAP heatmaps include more mid/high-frequency contributions and the time ordering of large peaks/troughs differs). This confirms Sample 11 is not best matched to label 3.\\n- Scoring fairness: given near one-to-one correspondence of the key low-frequency lobes (timing, amplitude ranges, smoothness) and matching SHAP regions with the exemplar label-2 samples and label-2 feature description, a maximal similarity score (4) is appropriate.\\n\\nConclusion: The sample is classified as label 2 (F-14 wings closed) with high confidence. Rationale summary: the sample exhibits the canonical label-2 signature \u2014 an early steep decline into a wide low-frequency trough (t\u224813\u201330), two separated mid low-frequency humps (t\u224839\u201352 and t\u224865\u201378), a late wide trough (t\u2248100\u2013115), and a final steep rise to a high endpoint \u2014 and SHAP + STFT confirm the classifier is using these low-frequency components as positive evidence. The provided label-2 reference samples and summary match these features closely, supporting a similarity score of 4.\"\n  ]\n}",

This descended segment is smooth (low local volatility) and has a large net change (~-3.0) with an average steep negative slope over the first ~25 steps. STFT: concentrated energy at the lowest frequency bins during this window, confirming the SHAP low-frequency attribution. Implication: a broad early valley is strongly driving positive SHAP.\",\n    \"    * Mid-sequence positive hump(s) (t \u2248 36 \u2192 55 \u2192 65): There is a smooth rise from the trough around t\u224830 up to a moderate peak near t\u224845\u201355 (amplitude ~+0.6 to +0.8), then a modest fall and another smooth rise to a similar mid-peak near t\u224865. These mid-lobes are low-volatility, low-frequency, and show concentrated low-frequency STFT energy where SHAP is red. Change rates are moderate (rise slopes ~+0.05\u2013+0.14 units/step), and volatility within the humps is low (no high-frequency spikes).\",\n    \"    * Late deep trough followed by final large rise (t \u2248 100 \u2192 125 \u2192 143): A pronounced negative trough occurs roughly around t\u2248104\u2013116 (min \u2248 -1.3 to -1.6) followed by a strong, relatively rapid recovery and a final climb to a very large positive endpoint (~+2.7 to +2.8 at t=143). SHAP again highlights low-frequency rows across this late trough\u2192rise window; STFT shows low-frequency energy here as well.

Thus the classifier is attributing mainly to slow, broad curvature events (not local jitter).\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall sample-level feature summary and temporal dependence:\",\n    \"  - Global shape: The series is dominated by large-scale, low-frequency undulations: an early large positive baseline then a deep trough, followed by mid-sequence broad humps, a late deep trough and a final large terminal rise. This yields roughly two full large-scale oscillatory cycles over the 144 points (trough\u2194peak\u2194trough\u2194final peak).\",\n    \"  - Frequency content & volatility: STFT confirms most signal energy relevant to the classifier is concentrated in the very-low-frequency bins during the SHAP-positive time blocks (start, mid, late). Local volatility is generally low inside the broad lobes; sharper transitions (e.g., the initial drop, the late recovery) are somewhat faster but remain dominated by low-frequency energy. Higher-frequency components are present only as small ripples and do not carry strong positive SHAP.\",\n    \"  - Temporal dependence: The discriminative evidence accumulates from temporally ordered low-frequency events\u2014the early decline into the first trough, the mid humps, the late trough and the final rise\u2014so the sequence and timing of these broad contour features matter for classification.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and initial label choice:\",\n    \"  - The label-2 (F-14 wings closed) feature summary explicitly describes: (1) an early large positive value followed by a steep decline into a wide trough (~t=0\u201335), (2) a mid-sequence positive hump (~t=36\u201352), (3) another later positive hump (~t=65\u201391), and (4) a pronounced late trough and recovery (~t=100\u2013125) culminating in a terminal rise to a high endpoint. The sample under analysis matches these elements closely in timing, amplitude and low-frequency character: the early steep fall to a trough, the mid humps around 40\u201370, the late trough near ~110 and the final large rise to the end are all present and are the SHAP-positive drivers.\",\n    \"  - Comparing alternative label summaries: other labels (e.g., label 1, 4, 5, 6) also emphasize low-frequency bulges but differ in the number, timing, or asymmetry of bulges and in which windows are decisive.

I map each red block to the time-series and STFT to describe precise local features.\\n\\n1) Early low-frequency block (SHAP red near bottom rows, ~t=13\u201339):\\n- Corresponding series behavior: a large, smooth downward ramp from a high positive start (\u2248+2.6 at t\u22480) through zero into a wide trough centered near t\u224825\u201330 with minimum around \u22121.4 to \u22121.7.\\n- Amplitude & trend: net change \u2248 \u22123.8 from the start high to trough; the trough is broad and sustained (\u224810\u201315 time steps wide).\\n- Change rate & volatility: the descent is relatively fast compared with later rises (steep negative slope on the early segment) but the trough itself is low-volatility (smooth, few high-frequency wiggles).\\n- Frequency content: STFT shows strong energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during this interval, confirming this is a slow/large-scale feature (not high-frequency noise).\\n- Shape/substructure: a monotonic fall into a wide valley (long-wavelength concavity) with little fine structure inside the trough.\\n\\n2) Mid/late low-frequency block (SHAP red near bottom rows, ~t=65\u201395):\\n- Corresponding series behavior: the trace contains a smooth, broad positive hump around t\u224848\u201355 (smaller), then another low-frequency positive bulge around t\u224865\u201390 peaking near \u2248+0.6\u2013+0.8 (the SHAP red is most intense around the rising/peak portion of this mid/late bulge).\\n- Amplitude & trend: moderate positive amplitude (roughly +0.5 to +0.8 at peak), preceded and followed by negative flanks. The rise/fall are comparatively smooth (low volatility) and span tens of steps (low frequency).\\n- Change rate & volatility: the ascent into that hump is moderate in slope and the hump itself has low instantaneous volatility; small higher-frequency local wiggles are visible superimposed but low-power in STFT.\\n- Frequency content: STFT shows low-frequency energy concentrated at the bottom rows in this time range; higher-frequency bands are weak.\\n\\n3) End / final rise (weaker SHAP red, ~t=130\u2013143):\\n- Corresponding series behavior: a fairly rapid large positive climb from a preceding trough (around t\u2248118\u2013125) up to a high endpoint \u2248+2.5\u2013+2.7.\\n- Amplitude & trend: final amplitude is large and the terminal rise is relatively brisk compared with interior rises (higher slope), but STFT still places most power at low frequencies for that window. SHAP attribution here is positive but less intense than the earlier blocks.\\n\\nOverall for local features: all SHAP-red regions correspond to broad, low-frequency lobes (deep troughs and broad positive bulges) with low volatility inside lobes and steeper transitions between lobes. The STFT confirms that the discriminative energy is concentrated in the lowest-frequency bins for those time ranges.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global sample characterization (task 2):\\n- Dominant structure: The series is dominated by large-scale, low-frequency oscillations (quasi-periodic broad lobes) across the 144 points: an early high-to-deep-trough, then recovery to mid positive lobes, a later deep trough, and a final strong rise to a large positive endpoint.\\n- Periodicity & spacing: Extrema are spaced roughly 40\u201350 time steps apart (early trough ~25, mid hump ~50\u201380, late trough ~110, final peak ~143), giving a long-wavelength quasi-periodic envelope rather than rapid repeated cycles.\\n- Volatility: Low volatility within broad lobes; some small high-frequency ripples appear in mid-sequence but STFT shows these are low-power and the SHAP map is neutral or slightly negative for mid-frequency bands. The classifier penalizes mid-frequency/higher-frequency content, favoring the smooth envelope.\\n- Asymmetry and rates: Asymmetric transitions are present \u2014 the early fall is relatively steep, the interior rises are smoother, and the final rise is faster. The model\u2019s SHAP emphasis is on slow low-frequency lobes (positive) and it downweights sharper, mid-frequency transitions (blue/neutral SHAP at mid frequencies in places).\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: The positive SHAP blocks occur at specific, separated positions (early trough region, mid bulges, end rise) and combine additively in attribution. This indicates the classifier depends on the presence and ordering of multiple low-frequency lobes (temporal pattern) rather than isolated peaks.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching sample features to labeled feature summaries (task 3):\\n- Label 2 summary (F-14 wings closed) highlights: (a) early large positive baseline followed by steep early fall into wide trough around t\u224813\u201335; (b) mid-sequence moderate positive hump around t\u224836\u201352; (c) another larger late positive hump around t\u224865\u201391; (d) a pronounced late negative trough around t\u2248100\u2013125 and a final rapid rise to a large positive endpoint. The SHAP/STFT emphasis on very-low-frequency rows at the early trough, mid/late hump, and late trough windows is also specifically mentioned.\\n- Comparison: The test sample includes each of these exact elements in timing, amplitude, and frequency content: early steep fall into a broad trough, mid positive hump(s) at the same relative positions, a later trough and a brisk terminal rise. STFT and SHAP align with the label-2 description (low-frequency energy and positive SHAP on those lobes). Visual comparison to the provided label-2 reference plots (samples 58, 69, 75, 63) shows a near one-to-one correspondence in waveform shape, timing of lobes, amplitude ranges and SHAP low-frequency emphasis.\\n- Therefore the highest matching label is label 2. I score the similarity to label 2 as 4 (high similarity) because both the feature-level description in the label-2 summary and the four reference examples match this sample very closely in timing, amplitude, low-frequency dominance, and SHAP attribution.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against reference examples and dissimilar labels (task 4):\\n- Reference samples 58, 69, 75 and 63 (all labeled 2) are visually and spectrally extremely similar: same early steep fall to a wide trough near t~25\u201330, same mid/late broad positive lobes, a deep trough around t~110\u2013120 and a strong final upward edge. Their STFTs show concentrated low-frequency energy in the same windows and their SHAP heatmaps emphasize the same bottom-frequency rows at the same time windows. This confirms the classification and the high similarity score.\\n- Dissimilar references (labels 3) show different mid-structure: while they also have broad lobes they present different timing/ordering and stronger positive mid-pulses in different windows and more positive SHAP across other frequency bands; their waveforms and SHAP patterns diverge from the sample\u2019s precise arrangement. This supports that the sample is not label 3 and reduces the likelihood of mislabeling.\\n- Fairness and scoring logic: Given the near-identical wave shape (timing of troughs/peaks), the matching low-frequency STFT signatures, and nearly identical SHAP attribution patterns between the test sample and the label-2 references, scoring label-2 similarity as 4 (high) is justified. Other labels\u2019 summaries (0,1,3,4,5,6) emphasize different arrangements/timings or different sign/amplitude patterns in their summaries and reference images; none match as closely as label 2.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 2 (F-14 wings closed) with similarity score = 4. The classification is supported by (a) explicit SHAP red concentration at lowest frequencies mapped to the early trough, mid positive bulges, and late trough/final rise; (b) STFT confirmation of dominant low-frequency energy in those same time blocks; (c) direct match to the label-2 pattern description and to multiple label-2 reference plots.\"\n  ]\n}",
      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 2\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local, fine-grained feature description (match SHAP red regions to the time series and STFT):\\n- Identified SHAP-positive (red) energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows in three main time blocks: roughly t\u224813\u201330, t\u224848\u201370 (weaker), and a stronger block t\u224865\u201395 (these blocks appear as bright red at the bottom rows of the SHAP heatmap). The STFT confirms the corresponding events are dominated by very-low-frequency content (bottom STFT rows have the highest magnitude during the same windows).\\n- Window A (approximately t=13\u201330): The series performs a large, smooth downward swing from near 0 down to a broad trough near \u22121.5 to \u22121.7 (centered \u2248 t=25\u201330). Volatility inside the trough is low (no rapid jitter), the change is a sustained low-frequency descent (average slope roughly \u22120.12 to \u22120.2 units/step during the fall). STFT: concentrated energy at the lowest frequency bins during this interval. SHAP: strongest positive attribution at the lowest frequencies here, meaning the classifier strongly uses this broad trough/descending curvature as positive evidence.\\n- Window B (approximately t=40\u201356): A smooth, low-volatility upward ramp from the trough toward a local positive peak around +0.6\u2013+0.8 (peak near t\u224850\u201355). The rise is gradual (moderate slope \u2248 +0.05\u2013+0.08 units/step), low-frequency in STFT and shows mild positive SHAP at the bottom rows (secondary supporting feature).\\n- Window C (approximately t=65\u201395): A further slow multi-lobe structure: a pronounced low-frequency positive lobe centered roughly in the mid 60s\u201370s (amplitude ~+0.6\u2013+0.8) with additional low-amplitude oscillations through the 70\u201395 window and a broad positive attribution in SHAP at the lowest frequency rows over this block. Volatility remains low inside the lobes; STFT again shows energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins. The combination of these mid-sequence lobes and their timing is strongly positively attributed by the model.\\n- Window D (approximately t=100\u2013125 and end): The series falls to another wide trough near t\u2248110 (amplitude \u2248 \u22121.3 to \u22121.6) and then performs a rapid recovery and strong final rise from \u2248t=125 to t=143 ending near +2.5\u2013+2.6. The trough and the subsequent large terminal rise also have low-frequency energy and register moderate positive SHAP at the bottom rows near the end. The final rise is steeper than most earlier rises (higher average slope), but still dominated by low-frequency energy.\\n- Frequencies and volatility summary at local feature level: across all SHAP-positive windows the signal is dominated by very-low-frequency content (STFT bottom rows). Local volatility is low inside the broad lobes/troughs; transient sharper edges (where mid-frequency energy appears) are either neutral or slightly negative in SHAP. This indicates the classifier favors broad smooth curvature events (timing and amplitude) rather than localized high-frequency spikes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and temporal combination of features:\\n- Global structure: The trace is a low-frequency, quasi-periodic multi-lobe envelope spanning the 144 points. The sequence shows: an early large descent into a sustained trough (t\u224813\u201330), recovery to a mid positive hump (t\u224840\u201356), a second mid/late positive hump (t\u224865\u201395), a late trough (t\u2248100\u2013120), and a strong final rise to a high endpoint (t\u2248125\u2013143). This ordering of trough\u2192rise\u2192mid hump\u2192late trough\u2192final rise is coherent and repeated in the reference pattern for the same label.\\n- Frequency content & volatility: STFT reveals most signal energy concentrated in the very lowest frequency bins during the key windows; higher-frequency content is weak and when present coincides with sharper transitions and is not positively attributed by SHAP. Volatility is low inside broad lobes and troughs, with steeper transitions at the start and the final climb.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: The classifier\u2019s SHAP map shows additive positive attribution across the separated low-frequency blocks. That is, multiple temporally separated broad events accumulate evidence. The relative timings (early trough then mid humps then late trough then final rise) appear to be important; the mid-sequence lobes and the late trough+recovery form a characteristic temporal signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison to label feature summaries and selection of best-matching label:\\n- Label 2 (F-14 wings closed) summary highlights: an early steep downward swing into a wide trough around t\u224813\u201335, a mid positive hump around t\u224836\u201352, another similar hump later (t\u224865\u201391) and a large late trough around t\u2248100\u2013125 followed by a rapid final rise \u2014 all concentrated at very-low-frequency rows in SHAP/STFT. This matches the test sample\u2019s timing, amplitudes, low-frequency dominance, and the sequence/order of events almost exactly.\\n- Other labels (0,1,3,4,5,6) also emphasize low-frequency features in some windows, but their characteristic temporal patterns differ: e.g., label 1 emphasizes a dominant mid-cycle but discounts the early decline and final rise; label 3 (F-14 wings opened) shows multiple separated negative lobes and rapid late positive pulses but its reference SHAP distributions and waveform details differ in substructure and ordering; label 4 (Harrier), 5 (F-22), 6 (F-15) have different main hump locations/amplitudes and different asymmetries. Comparing the test sample\u2019s exact ordering and amplitudes to the label summaries shows the strongest match with label 2.\\n- Therefore the chosen label is label 2 (F-14 wings closed). Based on the near one-to-one match with the label_2 pattern (timing of troughs/humps, low-frequency dominance, low volatility within lobes, and a large final rise), I assign the highest similarity score (4 = high similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference examples to validate the decision and scoring fairness:\\n- The four \u201csimilar\u201d references (Samples 58, 69, 75, 63 \u2014 all labeled 2) are visually and spectrally almost identical to the test sample: same early high-to-low descent into a broad trough near t\u224825\u201330, recovery to a mid hump \u224850, second mid hump \u224865\u201390, late trough \u2248105\u2013115, and final strong rise to the end. Their STFTs show the same low-frequency energy concentration and their SHAP maps show the same bottom-row red blocks at the same time windows. This confirms the test sample matches known label-2 examples very closely.\\n- Two \u201cdissimilar\u201d references (Samples 43 and 79 labeled 3) show a different mid-sequence structure (more alternating peaks across the mid-region and differing SHAP mid/high-frequency attributions) and different trough/peak ordering. The test sample does not present those differences, reinforcing that label 3 is a poorer match.\\n- Given the near-perfect alignment between the test sample\u2019s event timing/amplitude/frequency profile and the label_2 reference examples and textual pattern, scoring label 2 as 4 is consistent and fair. Other labels receive much lower implied similarity (not shown numerically here) because either the key event timings/amplitudes or SHAP frequency attributions do not align.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 2 (F-14 wings closed) with high similarity score = 4. The classifier\u2019s SHAP attribution and the STFT both support that the model is using the same low-frequency, temporally ordered broad troughs and humps as described for label 2.\"\n  ]\n}",

Volatility remains low in the broad lobes but there are small higher-frequency wiggles superimposed (low amplitude ~0.1\u20130.3) that carry little STFT energy and little or neutral SHAP.

Change rate: large negative slope over ~20\u201330 steps (average approx. -0.12 to -0.22 units/step during the main fall). Volatility: low inside the descent and trough (little high-frequency jitter). STFT: strong energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during this interval.

Periodicity: quasi-periodic low-frequency undulations with roughly 40\u201360 time-step spacing between successive extrema. Volatility: low within the main lobes and troughs, higher only at the sharper transition segments (the initial fall and the late recovery). Temporal dependence: the classifier appears to combine the timing and ordering of these broad lobes (early fall \u2192 mid humps \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise) as the discriminative signature; STFT and SHAP both indicate the same low-frequency windows are decisive.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Compare to label feature summaries and select best match: I compare the observed local and global features with the provided class descriptions.

The match is high in timing of extrema, amplitude range (start/endpoint \u2243 +2.6\u20132.8, troughs \u2243 -1.4 to -1.6), change rates (early steep drop, final strong rise), low-frequency concentration in STFT, and SHAP positive attribution localized to the same bottom-frequency rows in the same time windows.

The STFT confirms these blocks carry most energy in the very-low-frequency bins (bottom rows) at the same times, so the model is responding to slow, large-scale waveform components in those windows.\\n- Early block (t\u22480\u201330, strongest ~8\u201328): the trace starts at a very large positive value (~+2.6 at t=0) and falls smoothly through zero to a wide negative trough near t\u224826\u201330 (min \u2248 -1.6 to -1.7). Change rate: a sustained steep negative slope from the start, roughly -0.15 to -0.22 units/step averaged over that interval. Volatility: low within the ramp (smooth monotonic descent, no high-frequency spikes). STFT: concentrated at the lowest frequency bin. SHAP: strong positive attribution on the lowest-frequency rows here \u2014 the classifier treats this broad early descent + trough as strongly supportive.\\n- Mid block (t\u224836\u201355, strongest ~42\u201352): after the early trough the series rises smoothly to a moderate positive hump centered \u224848\u201352 (peak \u2248+0.7 to +0.8). Change rate: gradual upward slope (~+0.08\u2013+0.12 units/step), low volatility (broad smooth curvature). STFT: again low-frequency power concentrated in the bottom bins during this hump; SHAP: positive at lowest frequencies. This hump is a clear, slow low-frequency bulge that the model uses positively.\\n- Later mid block (t\u224865\u201390, strongest patch around \u224876\u201388): the signal shows another broad low-frequency positive excursion (peaks around +0.5\u2013+0.8 at \u224865 and \u224878\u201388 depending on sub-peak) interleaved with modest troughs; volatility remains low-to-moderate (the local ripples are small amplitude compared to the broad lobes). STFT: low-frequency energy concentrated across this window; SHAP: positive at lowest rows in this window as well. The classifier therefore treats repeated broad humps/troughs at these positions as further positive evidence.\\n- Late segment (t\u2248100\u2013143): a deep late trough occurs (~t\u2248104\u2013116 down to \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6) followed by a strong final recovery to a large positive endpoint (~+2.6 at t=143). STFT shows low-frequency content in the final rise; SHAP gives moderate positive attribution near the end (but strongest earlier in the low-frequency blocks). The presence of a late trough + final rise matches the multi-lobe slow structure emphasized by SHAP.\\n- Summary of local features: the model\u2019s positive attribution focuses on broad, slow (very low frequency) lobes: (1) a steep early descent to a wide trough, (2) a smooth mid hump, (3) a later mid hump, and (4) a wide late trough then terminal rise. All these are smooth (low volatility within each lobe) and carry most spectral energy at the lowest STFT bins.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall feature analysis:\\n- Trend & shape: the series is dominated by large-scale, low-frequency undulations (quasi-periodic broad peaks and troughs) across the 144 points. It begins at a high positive level, goes into a deep early trough, recovers into mid positive lobes, dips again in a deep late trough and ends with a strong final bulge. The global envelope shows ~2\u20133 slow cycles over the sequence rather than high-rate oscillations.\\n- Periodicity & frequency content: energy is concentrated in the very-low-frequency bins (STFT bright at bottom rows during key windows). There are repeated broad humps roughly separated by ~30\u201350 time steps. Small higher-frequency ripples exist (small amplitude wiggles in mid windows) but they are low-power in STFT and receive neutral-to-slight negative SHAP.\\n- Volatility: volatility is low inside the broad lobes (smooth ramps), with steeper slopes at transitions (early descent and some falls) but without sustained high-frequency jitter. Where mid-frequency energy appears (e.g., around faster transitions), SHAP often assigns neutral-to-negative values \u2014 the model penalizes sharper, high-frequency detail.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: the classifier appears to rely on the ordered sequence of these large low-frequency events (early trough \u2192 mid hump(s) \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise). Multiple separated low-frequency lobes additively strengthen the class score; isolated small ripples do not.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries (presence/absence):\\n- Compare to the label summaries: Label 2 (F-14 wings closed) description explicitly lists: a large early high\u2192deep trough around t\u224813\u201335, a mid positive hump around t\u224836\u201352, another mid/late positive hump around t\u224865\u201391 with strong low-frequency SHAP there, and a pronounced late trough and recovery around t\u2248100\u2013125 followed by a final rise to a large positive endpoint. This sequence and timing match Sample 35 very closely (same amplitude ranges, same low-frequency dominance, same smooth multi-lobe structure and ordering).\\n- Other labels (0,1,3,4,5,6): while all classes rely to some degree on low-frequency shape, their characteristic timing/asymmetry differs. For example, labels 0 and 1 emphasize different temporal positions or asymmetries (label 1 strongly emphasizes a dominant mid-window asymmetric hump but discounts edges), label 4 centers a single dominant mid hump with different surrounding trough structure, labels 5/6 have different hump magnitudes/timings and label 3 (F-14 wings opened) shows a different arrangement of negative pulses and positive pulses. The sample aligns almost exactly with the label-2 pattern and the four nearest reference examples shown (samples 63, 69, 75, 58) are visually and spectrally near-identical and all have label 2.\\n- Therefore the highest matching label is label 2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and finalize score:\\n- The four provided similar reference samples are all labeled 2 and are essentially the same waveform (same early steep descent to trough near t\u224825\u201330, similar mid hump near t\u224848\u201352, similar later hump near \u224878\u201390, similar deep late trough and final rise). Their STFT and SHAP heatmaps are also near-identical: low-frequency energy in the same time windows and red SHAP concentrated at the bottom frequency rows in the same columns. Sample 35 matches these both in time-domain shape and in time-frequency & attribution maps.\\n- The two dissimilar samples (labels 3.0) show different local peak/trough positions and a higher presence of mid-frequency SHAP patterns across other frequency rows; they are visually distinct from sample 35 and its reference label-2 neighbors.\\n- Given the near one-to-one correspondence in (a) timing of the lobes, (b) amplitude ranges (early +2.6 \u2192 trough \u2248 -1.6 \u2192 mid peaks \u2248 +0.6\u20130.8 \u2192 late trough \u2248 -1.4 \u2192 final +2.6), (c) low-frequency dominance in STFT, and (d) SHAP attribution concentrated on the same lowest-frequency bins at the same times, the similarity to label 2 is maximal.\\n\\nFinal decision and similarity score justification:\\n- Predicted class: label 2 (F-14 wings closed).\\n- Similarity score: 4 (high similarity). Rationale for score=4: there exists an explicit feature description in the label-2 summary that matches Sample 35, and all four provided 'similar' reference examples are labeled 2 and are essentially near-identical in waveform, STFT and SHAP patterns. Differences from label-2 prototypes are negligible.\\n\\nOverall conclusion: Sample 35 is best classified as label 2. The classifier\u2019s positive attribution targets exactly the same slow, large-scale lobes and timings described for label 2 in the reference material; therefore label 2 with highest-confidence similarity (4/4) is the correct assignment.\"\n  ]\n}"

      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 2\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local / fine-grained feature description (follow SHAP red regions):\\n- Primary SHAP block A (time \u2248 13 \u2192 30, lowest-frequency rows): In the raw trace this corresponds to the large early descent from a high start (t=0 \u2248 +2.6) through ~0 near t\u224812 down to a broad trough around t\u224825\u201330 (amplitude \u2248 -1.4 to -1.7). Change rate over the descent is high (roughly -2.9 to -3.2 units over ~14\u201318 steps \u2192 \u2248 -0.16 to -0.22 units/step), and volatility inside the descent is low (smooth monotonic fall, no strong high-frequency wiggles). The STFT shows this event has energy concentrated in the bottom frequency rows (very-low-frequency / DC-like). The classifier SHAP highlights the same lowest-frequency band in this window (strong red), indicating the model treats a broad, slow early downward curvature as a positive cue.\\n\\n- Secondary SHAP block B (time \u2248 36 \u2192 55, lowest-frequency rows, weaker red): On the plot this maps to a smooth mid-sequence rise to a moderate positive hump near t\u224848\u201355 (peak \u2248 +0.6 to +0.8). This hump is low-volatility (smooth convex shape), the slope of the rise is moderate (~+0.08\u2013+0.12 units/step), and STFT again concentrates energy at the lowest frequencies. SHAP shows positive attribution here, indicating that the presence and timing of this mid hump add evidence for the predicted class.\\n\\n- Tertiary SHAP block C (time \u2248 65 \u2192 95, lowest-frequency rows; especially \u224878\u201392): This block aligns with subsequent broad low-frequency oscillations: a positive excursion around t\u224865 (\u2248+0.6), another peak near t\u224878\u201390 (\u2248+0.6 to +0.9, a series of low-amplitude broad lobes), followed by a decline toward a later trough. Volatility within these lobes remains low (broad peaks rather than sharp spikes). STFT again shows most energy at the lowest frequencies for these times and SHAP attributes positive weight to those low-frequency components. Localized mid-frequency energy appears during the faster declines between these lobes (shorter-time transitions) and is not highlighted positively by SHAP.\\n\\n- Late behavior (time \u2248 100 \u2192 125 and 125 \u2192 143): The series dips into a fairly deep trough near t\u2248105\u2013120 (amplitude \u2248 -1.3 to -1.6) and then recovers sharply from \u2248125 onward to a large positive endpoint near +2.6 at t=143. The SHAP map shows low-frequency positive attribution near the later recovery (weaker than earlier blocks), and STFT indicates the recovery is also dominated by low-frequency energy. The sharpness of the recovery produces some moderate mid-frequency content but SHAP still favors the low-frequency trend.\\n\\n- Summary of local attributes: all SHAP-positive windows map to slow, large-scale curvature events (amplitudes: early descent ~-4 units total change from start to trough, mid/late humps ~+0.6\u2013+0.9, late trough ~-1.4, final rise ~+2.6). Volatility inside the positive-attributed windows is low; change rates vary (early fall steep; mid rises moderate; final rise relatively steep), and STFT confirms these discriminative events are largely low-frequency.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall sample-level feature analysis (trends, periodicity, volatility, dependence):\\n- Global structure and periodicity: The trace exhibits a slow quasi-periodic envelope composed of a few broad lobes / cycles across the 144 steps: (1) large early high \u2192 deep trough (0\u2192~30), (2) mid positive hump (~36\u219255), (3) further low-frequency lobes in the ~65\u219295 interval (two modest peaks), (4) a late trough (~100\u2192120) and (5) a strong final rise to the end. These undulations are spaced tens of steps apart (dominant energy at very low frequencies in the STFT). This yields a clear low-frequency multi-lobe signature with roughly 2\u20133 large-scale cycles across the sequence.\\n\\n- Volatility profile: Low volatility within the long ramps and humps; greater instantaneous slope during the early descent and the final recovery. Short higher-frequency wiggles are present only as small texture (visible around some transitions) and STFT shows these as low-power relative to the DC/low-frequency bands; SHAP mostly ignores or weakly penalizes those higher-frequency components.\\n\\n- Temporal dependence and ordering: The sample\u2019s discriminative pattern depends on the ordering of broad events: an early, large descent into a wide trough, followed by a mid-sequence hump, then additional broad lobes, a late trough and a final rise. The SHAP attribution concentrates on the same low-frequency rows whenever a broad lobe/trough occurs, implying the model uses the timing and sequence of these large-scale contours (not isolated spikes) to decide.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and initial label selection (quantified similarity reasoning):\\n- Compare to label_2 (F-14 wings closed) summary: label_2 explicitly describes an early large positive start followed by a steep early fall into a pronounced trough around t\u224825\u201330, a moderate mid hump near ~36\u201352, another positive oscillation strongly attributed around ~78\u201391, a second large negative trough around ~104\u2013120, and a final rapid rise to a large positive endpoint. This is essentially the same sequence, amplitude ranges, low-frequency dominance, and SHAP attribution pattern present in the test sample. Degree of match: very high (4/4).\\n\\n- Compare to label_0 (Mirage): label_0 emphasizes a strong mid-window slow rise around t\u224826\u201365 and multiple broad peaks with low-frequency concentration; while there is some overlap in low-frequency emphasis, Mirage patterns place strongest positive attribution to a slow mid rise and other timing differences (and the specific early trough/timing differs). Match: moderate-to-low (2/4).\\n\\n- Compare to label_3 (F-14 wings opened): label_3 also highlights low-frequency lobes and multiple separated slow swings, but its prototypical pattern shows different timing and magnitudes of troughs/peaks (and the provided dissimilar examples show different SHAP frequency spread). The test sample aligns more closely with the label_2 timing (early trough \u224825\u201330, mid hump \u224850, secondary hump \u224878\u201390, late trough \u2248105\u2013120, final rise) than with label_3 examples. Match: low-to-moderate (2/4).\\n\\n- Compare to labels 1, 4, 5, 6: Those classes present different characteristic signatures in the provided summaries (e.g., label_1 has a dominant mid-window large asymmetric hump but different shape/asymmetry; labels 4/5/6 show single dominant humps at different positions or asymmetric rises). The test sample\u2019s distinctive early trough + mid and late lobes + final rise best matches label_2 rather than these other classes. Match to these: low (1\u20132/4).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four most-similar reference samples included in the prompt (Samples 75, 69, 58, 63) are all labeled 2 and their time-series plots, STFTs and SHAP heatmaps are visually and numerically nearly identical to Sample 36: same early high\u2192deep trough near t\u224825\u201330, same mid hump near t\u224848\u201355, similar smaller lobes at ~65\u201390, a late trough near ~105\u2013120 and final rise to \u2248+2.6. Their SHAP maps emphasize the same lowest-frequency rows in the same time windows. This strong match in shape, timing, amplitude, frequency content and SHAP attribution confirms the classification.\\n\\n- The two dissimilar examples provided (labeled 3) show more/broader SHAP activation at other frequencies and different relative timing of peaks/troughs; they therefore do not conflict with the chosen label.\\n\\nConclusion and final decision:\\n- The sample\u2019s features (early large descent to trough at t\u224825\u201330, mid hump \u224848\u201355, secondary lobes \u224865\u201395, late trough \u2248104\u2013120, final rise to +2.6) and the concentration of positive SHAP values at the lowest-frequency rows in those exact time windows match the label_2 (F-14 wings closed) pattern almost exactly. The reference label-2 samples provided are near-identical. Therefore final predicted label: label 2 (F-14 wings closed). Similarity score for chosen label: 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}"

      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 2\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local feature (from SHAP red regions -> plot & STFT): SHAP places strongest positive mass in the lowest-frequency rows during three main time blocks; mapping those to the trace gives: (a) Early block (roughly t\u22480\u201326, strongest influence ~t\u22480\u201326): the series starts very high (~+2.6\u2013+2.8 at t=0), crosses zero by ~t=13 then falls to a broad trough around t\u224825\u201328 (~-1.4 to -1.6). This is a large-amplitude, low-frequency downward ramp (average slope ~ -0.12 to -0.20 units/step), low local volatility inside the trough (smooth). STFT shows elevated energy at the bottom frequency bins here, consistent with SHAP attribution. (b) Middle block (roughly t\u224839\u201378, strongest ~t\u224839\u201370): the trace shows one or two smooth positive humps: a rise from near 0 to ~+0.6\u2013+0.8 (peak around t\u224844\u201352), a decline to a modest negative dip, then a second broad rise to another modest peak near t\u224864\u201370 (~+0.6\u2013+0.8). These are slow, low-volatility bulges (average slopes modest, no sharp spikes). STFT again concentrates energy at the lowest frequencies in this window. (c) Late block (roughly t\u2248100\u2013130): a broad negative trough centered ~t\u2248104\u2013116 (~-1.3 to -1.6) followed by a smooth, relatively fast recovery and a strong final rise from ~t\u2248125 to 143 reaching ~+2.7 at the end (average slope of final climb ~ +0.12\u2013+0.18). SHAP highlights the lowest-frequency rows here as positive contributors. In all red areas mid/high frequency bands are weak in STFT and mostly neutral/negative in SHAP, supporting the interpretation that the model favors broad low-frequency contour features in these windows.\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and temporal dependence: The whole 144-point trace is dominated by large, slow undulations (low-frequency energy throughout) with three main low-frequency events in time order: an early high-to-deep-trough descent, a mid-sequence series of two broad positive lobes, and a late deep trough then strong final rise. Volatility is low inside broad lobes and troughs, with small higher-frequency ripples confined to the mid-late region but carrying little STFT power and little positive SHAP. The sample therefore encodes a multi-lobe low-frequency contour signature (early bulge \u2192 trough \u2192 mid bulges \u2192 late trough \u2192 final bulge) where ordering and amplitude of lobes matter; sharper, high-frequency transitions are penalized by the model (blue/neutral SHAP at mid frequencies).\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label descriptions: The sample matches the label-2 (F-14 wings closed) descriptive pattern closely.

SHAP low-frequency attributions and STFT energy align with the label-2 explanation. By comparison: label 0/1/4/5/6 also rely on low-frequency features but have different timing, asymmetry or a different primary window (e.g., label 1\u2019s strongest cue was a mid-window asymmetric build-to-peak then fast fall centered ~39\u201395 but earlier/late windows are treated differently; label 3\u2019s pattern (wings-open) has different arrangement and stronger negative mid trough signatures). I assigned per-label similarity (1\u20134) based on how many characteristic elements match: label_0: 2 (some low-frequency agreement but different timing/shape), label_1: 3 (shares mid low-frequency lobes but differs in which window is decisive and in how late rise is treated), label_2: 4 (high similarity \u2014 almost all hallmark features match), label_3: 2 (same aircraft family but wings-open patterns differ in the timing/shape combination), label_4: 2 (Harrier has a dominant single mid hump which differs in placement/amplitude), label_5: 2 (F-22 shows mid-hump patterns but amplitudes/timing differ), label_6: 2 (F-15 has persistent low-frequency envelope but penalizes some transitions seen here).

Dissimilar examples (label 3) show different mid/late patterns and more distributed SHAP at other frequencies; their waveforms differ visually (different phase of broad lobes and different amplitude ordering). Given the tight alignment of waveform morphology, timing of extrema, STFT low-frequency concentration, and SHAP positive attribution blocks with the label-2 prototypes, the classification as label 2 is robust. The numeric similarity score for the chosen label (label 2) is therefore 4 (high similarity).\",\n    \"Final decision: label 2 (F-14 wings closed) with similarity score 4.

The STFT confirms these intervals concentrate energy in the lowest frequency bins, so the red SHAP cells mark genuine low-frequency shape features rather than high-frequency noise.\",\n        \"Step 2 \u2014 Global / temporal summary: The entire series shows a high positive start (t\u22480 \u2248 +2.5) followed by a broad descent to a deep trough (t\u224830 \u2248 -1.6), then the mid-series broad positive bulge and small oscillations (t\u224850\u201390), a second long negative valley (t\u2248104\u2013120 \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6), and a final strong rise to the global maximum at the last timestep (t\u2248143 \u2248 +2.6). Volatility is mostly concentrated in slow, large-scale swings (low-frequency), with only small higher-frequency wiggles around the mid-section. Temporally, the mid-window low-frequency lobe(s) co-occur with the strongest positive SHAP attribution and therefore dominate the model\u2019s decision signal.\",\n        \"Step 3 \u2014 Comparison to known misclassification patterns and conclusion: The pattern (strong low-frequency, mid-series broad lobe / two-lobe motif with smooth rises and troughs) matches the described motif that caused true-label-0 samples to be pushed toward class 1 in the provided examples (dominant red block near low-frequency rows in the mid-segment). Because the sample\u2019s decisive SHAP signal is that same mid-window, low-frequency structure, it is highly likely the black-box model will favor label 1 (Eurofighter) over the true label.

This is a large-amplitude, low-frequency downward ramp with low local volatility (smooth), high net change (~-2.5 to -3.0 across ~12\u201315 steps) and an average negative slope on the order of -0.15 to -0.25 units/step. STFT shows strong energy in the bottom frequency bins in this interval and SHAP assigns strong positive attribution at those same very-low-frequency rows.

This yields roughly two large-scale oscillation half-cycles across 144 points (broad trough\u2013peak\u2013trough\u2013peak structure).\",\n        \"2) Volatility & change rates: Within the broad lobes volatility is low (smooth ramps); the transitions between lobes can be steeper (e.g., the final recovery and the early descent). Mid-frequency ripples are small and carry little importance for classification. STFT confirms that most signal magnitude is concentrated in the very-low-frequency rows, aligning with SHAP positive bands.\",\n        \"3) Temporal dependence & combination: The model\u2019s SHAP map indicates additive positive contributions from several temporally separated low-frequency events (early descent, mid hump, mid-late hump, late trough/recovery). The ordering (early descent \u2192 mid hump \u2192 later trough \u2192 final rise) matches the class-specific multi-lobe contour pattern the classifier learned; the presence and timing of these low-frequency lobes together form the discriminative signature.\",\n        \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching against label feature summaries and selection:\",\n        \"1) Compare to label 2 (F-14 wings closed) summary: The label-2 description emphasizes an early large positive start followed by a steep early fall into a wide trough (~t\u224813\u201335), a moderate mid hump (~36\u201352), additional similar later positives (~65\u201391), a pronounced late trough (~100\u2013125) and a final rapid rise to a large positive endpoint.

For example, label 4 (Harrier) centers a dominant mid hump but with different surrounding trough structure; label 1 emphasizes a mid large asymmetric hump with different early/late attribution.

The lowest-frequency rows are bright red in those windows indicating slow/large-scale features drive the classifier.\\n\\n- Early block (approx. t=8\u201330): Time-series manifestation: starts at a large positive value (~+2.6 at t=0), then a smooth, mostly monotonic fall through zero to a wide negative trough centered near t\u224825\u201330 with minimum \u2248 -1.4 to -1.7. Change rate: fairly steep descent over \u224815\u201325 steps (average slope roughly -0.1 to -0.22 units/step in the falling portion). Volatility: low inside the trough (smooth curvature, no high-frequency jitter). STFT: concentrated energy at the lowest frequency rows during this interval, confirming the event is low-frequency. Interpretation: a broad, deep valley (large negative lobe) which is a strong positive cue per SHAP.\\n\\n- Mid block (approx. t=40\u201378, strongest near 48\u201366 and again 72\u201378): Time-series manifestation: a smooth rise from negative values to a series of broad positive humps/peaks. Peak amplitudes in this region reach roughly +0.7 to +0.9 (first mid hump ~t=48\u201355) and there is a second broader hump around t\u224872\u201378. Change rates: the rises are moderate (slopes \u2248 +0.05 to +0.15 units/step), with low within-hump volatility. STFT: again shows dominant energy at the very low frequency bins in these times. SHAP: intense red at lowest-frequency rows aligned to the rising/peaking portions, indicating these broad rises strongly support the class prediction.\\n\\n- Late block (approx. t=100\u2013143, strongest trough ~100\u2013120 then final rise 125\u2013143): Time-series manifestation: a broad negative trough centered around t\u2248110\u2013120 with amplitude \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6, followed by a relatively rapid final recovery and strong terminal rise to ~+2.6 by t=143 (end).

STFT: low-frequency power returns here; SHAP shows positive attribution on the low-frequency rows during the trough-to-final-rise recovery indicating that the timing of this late trough plus final bulge is considered supportive.\\n\\n- Local/high-frequency details: In the mid 60\u201390 window, there are several small wiggles (amplitude \u00b10.1\u20130.3).

This gives roughly two large-scale trough-to-peak cycles across the sequence.\\n- Frequency content: STFT and SHAP consistently show energy and positive attribution concentrated in the lowest frequency bins. There is minimal relevant energy at higher frequencies \u2014 short, sharp features are either absent or negatively/neutral attributed.\\n- Volatility and slopes: Volatility is low inside humps/troughs (smooth curves); sharper transitions occur at the start descent and the final rise but these are still dominated by low-frequency spectral energy. The classifier favors slow, smooth undulations and penalizes sharper mid-frequency spikes.\\n- Temporal dependence and combination: The positive SHAP blocks occur at consistent, separated time windows (early trough, mid humps, late trough + final rise). The classifier appears to treat these low-frequency events additively: multiple supporting lobes at the learned positions strengthen evidence. The ordering (early trough \u2192 mid humps \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise) matches an interpretable contour signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and selection of top label:\\n- Comparison to label_2 (F-14 wings closed): The label_2 summary explicitly describes: an early large positive start then steep drop to a deep early trough (t\u22480\u201315 then trough \u224825\u201330), a mid-sequence moderate positive hump (\u224836\u201352), another positive hump around 65\u201391, and a pronounced late trough and recovery (\u2248100\u2013125) followed by a final rise to a large endpoint.

Sample 54 matches better to label_2's specific trough\u2013hump\u2013trough ordering and amplitudes.\\n  - label_1 (Eurofighter), label_4 (Harrier), label_5 (F-22), label_6 (F-15): these labels emphasize different mid-window shapes, asymmetries, or unique hump timings; their reference plots show different relative amplitudes or hump counts compared with sample 54. The match is noticeably weaker than to label_2.\\n  - label_3 (F-14 wings opened): differs by having different sign/placement of large lobes (and different SHAP patterns) \u2014 while still an F-14 variant, the 'wings opened' templates have different central peak/trough location and slightly different rise/fall asymmetries.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final scoring logic:\\n- The four provided 'similar' reference samples are all labeled 2 and are visually nearly identical: same early high-to-deep-trough, same mid dual-hump structure, similar late trough then final rise, matching STFT low-frequency footprints, and the SHAP heatmaps all show red at the identical lowest-frequency rows and similar time blocks. This strongly supports label_2.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' samples are labeled 3 and show different mid/late structure (larger mid positive peaks earlier, different trough depths and more high-frequency content in SHAP) \u2014 they are clearly less similar to sample 54.\\n- Based on direct feature overlap (timing of troughs and humps, amplitude ranges, low-frequency STFT energy, SHAP positive blocks at the same time bins), the sample-to-label_2 match is high. There is both qualitative and spectral/evidence-level consistency with label_2's feature summary.\\n\\nFinal decision and similarity scoring justification:\\n- Chosen label: label 2 (F-14 wings closed). Rationale: near-perfect correspondence of (1) the tri-block low-frequency positive SHAP pattern, (2) the early deep trough timing and amplitude, (3) mid dual-hump structure, (4) late trough and final strong rise, and (5) STFT low-frequency concentration \u2014 all of which are the hallmark features described for label_2 and seen in multiple reference samples.\\n- Similarity score (to chosen label): 4 (high similarity). Justification: the sample's waveform, STFT, and SHAP maps are almost identical to the label_2 examples and to the label_2 feature description \u2014 matching timing, amplitude, shape, volatility and frequency content.\\n\\n(If a breakdown across labels is useful: approximate visual/spectral similarity scores on 1\u20134 scale: label_0: 2, label_1: 2, label_2: 4, label_3: 2, label_4: 1, label_5: 1, label_6: 2 \u2014 these support label_2 as the top match.)\"\n    ]\n}"

I use those red blocks to locate important waveform regions in the time plot and STFT.\\n\\n- Block A (t \u2248 39\u201352): In the time plot the segment from about t=39 to t=52 is a smooth low-volatility positive hump. Amplitude: the hump rises from just below 0 up to roughly +0.6\u2013+0.8 at its peak. Trend & change rate: the rise is gradual over \u224810\u201314 steps (moderate positive slope \u2248 +0.05\u2013+0.08 units/step) and the following descent is also smooth. Volatility/substructure: there are no fast spikes inside this window; the STFT shows energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins, confirming this is a broad, low-frequency bulge. This interval is strongly positively attributed by SHAP, indicating the classifier treats this broad hump as supportive evidence.\\n\\n- Block B (t \u2248 64\u201380): The next SHAP-red window maps to a second broad positive excursion peaking near t\u224866\u201372 (visible sub-peaks around ~66 and ~74). Amplitude: peaks again around +0.6\u2013+0.8. Shape & substructure: this block contains an ascent to a local maximum followed by a smooth fall into a modest trough \u2014 again low volatility and dominated by low-frequency content per the STFT. SHAP intensity here is high at the bottom frequency rows, so the model relies on this slow repeated lobe as further positive evidence.\\n\\n- Block C (t \u2248 104\u2013130): The largest negative trough and the final recovery are nearby. The SHAP red coverage extends across the low-frequency row over this later interval, reflecting the importance of the late slow swings. In the plot there is a deep, wide negative valley centered near t\u2248110\u2013115 (amplitude down to \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6) followed by a steady recovery beginning \u2248t=125 and a steep final rise to an endpoint \u2248+2.7 at t=143. Change rate: the final rise (\u2248t=125\u2013143) is relatively brisk (average slope \u2248 +0.12\u2013+0.17 units/step). STFT again shows low-frequency energy concentrated here and SHAP gives positive attribution at those low frequencies for the late recovery & endpoint bulge.\\n\\n- Early-edge feature (t \u2248 0\u201326) \u2014 supporting context: The time plot begins near +2.6 at t=0 and descends sharply to a broad trough around t\u224825 (\u2248 -1.4 to -1.6). The STFT shows low-frequency energy during this descent and SHAP also shows some positive low-frequency attribution earlier (weaker than the mid blocks but present). Manifestation: a large early downward swing (steep slope) then a smooth trough \u2014 treated as part of the class signature.\\n\\n- High-frequency detail and volatility: Across the three main positive SHAP regions the local volatility is low (smooth ramps). There are small, higher-frequency wiggles between ~60\u201395 (small amplitude \u00b10.1\u20130.3) visible in the plot; STFT places little energy at higher frequencies and SHAP shows neutral/slightly negative attribution there. So the classifier rewards slow/large-scale components and penalizes sharper mid-frequency variability.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature characterization and time-dependence:\\n- Dominant frequencies and periodicity: The sample is dominated by very low-frequency (long-wavelength) components \u2014 broad peaks and troughs that repeat across the sequence (quasi-periodic at a low fundamental frequency). The STFT shows most energy in the lowest frequency bins during the key windows (mid and late), consistent with SHAP attribution.\\n\\n- Global trend and envelope: The global envelope shows: high positive at start (\u2248+2.6) \u2192 steep fall to a wide trough (\u2248t=25) \u2192 two mid-sequence low-frequency humps (\u2248t=39\u201352 and \u2248t=64\u201380) \u2192 deeper late trough (\u2248t=104\u2013116) \u2192 final strong rise to endpoint (\u2248t=143, \u2248+2.7). This long-scale sequence of trough\u2192rise\u2192peak\u2192trough\u2192final rise is the principal structure.\\n\\n- Volatility profile: Low local volatility within broad humps/troughs; a few localized sharper transitions (notably the early descent and the final recovery) that produce larger slopes but still concentrate energy at low frequencies overall. Small-scale jitter in the middle (\u224860\u201395) is present but weak and not positively weighted by SHAP.\\n\\n- Temporal dependence and combination: The classifier appears to combine multiple temporally-separated low-frequency events: early high\u2192early trough, mid humps, late trough and terminal rise. The relative timing (early trough near t\u224825, mid-humps around 40\u201380, late trough \u2248100\u2013120, final rise after \u2248125) is consistent and forms a discriminative sequence rather than isolated features. The SHAP map shows additive positive contributions from the mid and late low-frequency blocks.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and provisional classification:\\n- Compare with label summaries: The composite pattern (early large descent to trough at \u224825, mid-sequence low-frequency humps around 36\u201380, a pronounced late trough \u2248100\u2013120, and a strong final rise to a high endpoint) matches very closely the label_2 (F-14 wings closed) description in the provided summaries. Label_2's summary explicitly lists positive SHAP concentrated at low frequencies for windows \u224813\u201326, 78\u201391 and 104\u2013130 and emphasizes the same multi-stage trough\u2013hump\u2013trough\u2013rise structure. The sample's SHAP + STFT and time-series morphology align to a high degree with that description.\\n\\n- Comparison with other labels: Other labels (0,1,3,4,5,6) share the emphasis on low-frequency humps in some cases but differ in timing, amplitude asymmetry, or presence/absence of the specific early steep drop + two mid humps + late trough + final strong rise sequence. For example:\\n  * label_0 (Mirage) emphasizes low-frequency rises concentrated at different mid windows and slightly different asymmetries; sample 67's exact ordering and trough positions align better to label_2.\\n  * label_3 (F-14 wings opened) also focuses on large low-frequency swings but its mid/late pulses and signs differ (more negative-centered mid troughs and different timing), and the dissimilar reference samples provided for label_3 show a different pattern of mid-sequence high-frequency content and SHAP distribution.\\n  * labels 4/5/6 (Harrier, F-22, F-15) each have distinctive single dominant hump timing or different asymmetries that do not match the multi-hump pattern and trough timings seen here.\\n\\nProvisional classification (highest match): label 2 (F-14 wings closed) with a high similarity.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four 'similar' reference samples included (samples 54, 30, 95, 51) are all labeled 2. Visually and spectrally they are nearly identical to Sample 67: same large starting value, steep early descent to a trough near t\u224825, two mid low-frequency humps around 40\u201380, a late trough near 104\u2013120 and a final large rise to the end. Their STFTs show strong energy concentrated at the lowest frequencies in the same time windows and their SHAP heatmaps highlight the same low-frequency bottom rows in the same temporal blocks. This strong concordance confirms the earlier matching and supports classifying Sample 67 as label 2.\\n\\n- The two 'dissimilar' samples (labels 3.0 examples) show different mid-sequence shapes and more widespread SHAP at mid-frequency rows; they do not match Sample 67's low-frequency-dominated triple-block pattern. This further reinforces that label 3 is not a better fit.\\n\\n- Similarity scoring rationale: Given the near one-to-one match of the time-series morphology (timing and amplitude of troughs and humps), the identical low-frequency STFT signature at the same windows, and the SHAP attribution pattern matching the label_2 description, Sample 67 matches the label_2 prototype strongly. Under the requested 1\u20134 scoring rubric, this is a high similarity (score = 4).\\n\\nFinal decision:\\n- Result: label 2 (F-14 wings closed).\\n- Score for chosen label: 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

Change rate: a steep negative descent over the first ~12\u201320 steps (average slope roughly -0.15 to -0.22 units/step in the early descent), then a slower leveling into the sustained trough (low volatility inside the trough). STFT: strong energy concentrated at the bottom frequency bins here. Interpretation: the classifier treats this wide, slow negative excursion (a broad low-frequency valley) as strongly positive evidence for the label.\\n- Red block B (approx. t \u2248 36\u201352, low-frequency rows): The signal rises smoothly from the trough to a mid-segment positive hump (peak near +0.6 to +0.8 around t\u224848\u201352). This is a low-volatility, low-frequency hump spanning ~10\u201318 steps; the STFT shows low-frequency energy and SHAP is positive at the same low rows. Change rate: moderate positive slope during rise (\u2248+0.08\u2013+0.12 units/step).

This matches the sample's exact sequence of events in timing, amplitude, low-frequency concentration, low internal volatility, and SHAP attribution. High similarity.\\n- Other labels (quick contrasts): Label 3 (F-14 wings opened) also emphasizes separated low-frequency lobes but typically shows a different pattern of trough/peak timing and stronger mid/late positive pulses in different windows; the dissimilar references for label 3 show different mid-frequency/SHAP patterns and extra variability. Labels 0,1,4,5,6 have some low-frequency dependence but their characteristic timing/asymmetry (e.g., dominant single mid hump for Harrier, Eurofighter mid-window asymmetry, etc.) does not align as closely as label 2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final confidence:\\n- The four supplied 'similar' reference plots (samples 63, 69, 58, 75) are all labeled 2 and are visually nearly identical to sample 72 in the exact sequence of events (high start \u2192 deep early trough near t\u224825 \u2192 mid hump near t\u224850 \u2192 another mid hump near t\u224872 \u2192 late trough near t\u2248110 \u2192 final rise to high endpoint).

Change rate: large negative average slope over ~20\u201330 steps (roughly -0.1 to -0.2 units/step during descent). Volatility: low within the descent (smooth, no strong high-frequency oscillations). STFT: strong energy at the lowest frequency rows during this window. Interpretation: a broad, slow downward curvature (large-scale valley) that gives positive SHAP weight.\\n  2) Mid block (approx. t \u2248 36\u201380, strongest approx. 45\u201378): after the early trough the signal rises smoothly to a moderate positive hump (peaks near +0.6 to +0.9 around t\u224848\u201355), shows small intermediate oscillations (small wiggles around t\u224860\u201370), and then another broad positive excursion near t\u224872\u201380. Change rates: slow-to-moderate upward ramps (~+0.05 to +0.15 units/step) with low local volatility inside the ramps. STFT: again concentrated at lowest frequencies; SHAP red concentrated on lowest rows across these times. Interpretation: one or two wide, low-frequency bulges (slow rises/peaks) the model treats as supportive.\\n  3) Late block (approx. t \u2248 100\u2013143, strongest approx. 104\u2013130 and terminal rise): signal declines after mid-section into a wide late trough around t\u2248105\u2013120 (min around -1.5 to -1.6) then recovers rapidly to a high positive endpoint (~+2.5 at t=143). The late recovery is steeper (faster positive slope) than earlier rises. STFT: low-frequency energy concentrated in the late block; SHAP again positive at bottom rows. Interpretation: a late broad trough plus a final strong low-frequency rise that the classifier also uses positively.\\n- Secondary notes: small higher-frequency wiggles between main lobes (e.g., t\u224860\u201370) produce little SHAP support and modest mid-frequency STFT energy; where mid-frequency energy is present the SHAP map is neutral/negative, indicating the model prefers broad low-frequency shape over sharp high-frequency detail.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and dependence:\\n- Global structure: the sequence is dominated by a small number (2\u20133) of large-scale low-frequency undulations: an early high-to-low sweep (t0\u2192~25), a mid recovery with 1\u20132 broad humps (t\u224836\u201380), and a late trough \u2192 strong final rise (t\u2248100\u2192143). This yields most STFT power concentrated at the lowest frequency rows across those windows.\\n- Periodicity & timing: quasi-periodic long-wavelength pattern (broad trough\u2192peak\u2192trough\u2192peak across 144 points). The timing of these lobes is important: early trough near t\u224825, mid hump(s) around t\u224848\u201378, late trough near t\u2248110, final rise to endpoint. The model\u2019s SHAP attribution concentrates on these positions, indicating temporal dependence (order and relative timing matter).\\n- Volatility & shape: within broad events volatility is low (smooth ramps). Transition segments (especially the final rise) can be steeper and higher-slope than the slow rises; these faster transitions sometimes produce mid-frequency STFT energy and are less positively attributed. Overall, the classifier favors smooth, large-scale convex/concave contour segments over jagged, high-frequency details.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label descriptions (which label pattern best matches):\\n- Compare to the provided label summaries: label_2 (F-14 wings closed) description emphasizes: an early large positive starting value followed by a steep fall into a wide trough around t\u224825\u201330, mid-sequence moderate positive hump(s) (~36\u201352 and 65\u201391), a pronounced late trough (~100\u2013125) and a final rise to a large positive endpoint. SHAP for label_2 is concentrated at very low frequencies in time blocks ~13\u201326, ~78\u201391, and ~104\u2013130. This is essentially the same temporal segmentation, amplitude ranges, low-frequency dominance and SHAP attribution seen in the test sample.\\n- Other labels: many other labels (0,1,4,5,6) emphasize low-frequency bulges too, but their characteristic timings / asymmetries differ (e.g., label_0 and label_1 rely on different mid-window phase/asymmetry; label_4 centers on a very large mid hump at ~52\u201371 which is not the dominant feature here). Label_3 (F-14 wings opened) also shows low-frequency components but with different alignment of peaks/troughs and slightly different SHAP pattern (and sometimes stronger mid-frequency contributions in certain blocks). The test sample\u2019s exact combination (early steep fall to trough near t\u224825, mid humps in the 36\u201380 region, late trough near 100\u2013120, terminal strong rise) matches label_2 closely.\\n- Therefore the highest matching degree = label 2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Reference-sample cross-check and robustness:\\n- The four provided \u201csimilar\u201d reference examples are all labeled 2 and their plots, STFTs, and SHAP heatmaps are visually nearly identical to the test sample: same early descent from +2.6 to ~-1.6 around t\u224825\u201330, mid low-frequency humps around t\u224848\u201378, late trough \u2248 t\u2248105\u2013120, and final rise to a large positive endpoint. Their STFTs consistently place energy in the lowest frequency rows in the same time windows, and their SHAP maps show red concentrated in those same rows/time blocks. This strongly confirms the morphological and attributional match.\\n- The two provided \u201cdissimilar\u201d samples (label 3) show more distributed SHAP color across additional frequency rows and have different mid-sequence peak/trough phasing. Although both label 2 and label 3 are F-14 variants and share some broad low-frequency structure, the temporal ordering and exact window locations of the positive SHAP for the test sample align with the label_2 prototypes and the set of label_2 references rather than the label_3 references.\\n- Scoring logic: because the test sample matches the label_2 feature summary almost point-for-point (timing of early trough, mid humps, late trough, final rise; low-frequency dominance; SHAP concentrated at very-low-frequency rows in the same windows), I assign the highest similarity score (4 = high similarity). Other labels do show partial similarity in the abstract (low-frequency bulges), but the exact temporal arrangement and SHAP localization match label_2 best.\\n\\nFinal decision: predicted label = label 2 (F-14 wings closed). Similarity score (confidence-style integer) = 4 (high similarity), justified by near-exact match of time windows, amplitude ranges, low-frequency STFT energy, and SHAP attribution to the label_2 prototype and multiple label_2 reference examples.\"\n  ]\n}",

The descent is mostly monotonic and low-volatility inside the trough (few small ripples).\\n  - Amplitude & trend: net change \u2248 -3.8 over ~25 steps; average slope in the main descent \u2248 -0.14 to -0.20 units/step (locally steeper at start).\\n  - Volatility & substructure: low volatility within the trough (smooth), small higher-frequency wiggles of very low amplitude (0.1\u20130.3) appear only as minor texture.\\n  - STFT corroboration: strong energy concentrated in the bottom frequency bins during the same time window (dominant DC/very-low-frequency content).\\n  - Interpretation: the model attributes this broad early fall / sustained trough (low-frequency, large-scale curvature) positively \u2014 i.e., this macro-shape is a discriminative cue.\\n\\n- Red block B (mid, lowest-frequency rows) \u2014 approx. t \u2248 36\u201352 and continuing weakly to \u224865\u201391:\\n  - Manifestation in plot: after the early trough the series rises smoothly to a moderate positive hump around t\u224845 (amplitude \u2248 +0.6\u2013+0.8). Later there is another smooth positive oscillation roughly spanning t\u224865\u201390 with a modest peak (\u2248+0.5\u2013+0.8) and separated troughs between these humps. These are broad, low-volatility humps (not spiky).\\n  - Amplitude & trend: moderate amplitude increases (\u22481.0\u20131.8 from local troughs) over ~10\u201325 steps; slopes are gentle-to-moderate (\u2248+0.05 to +0.12 units/step).\\n  - Volatility & substructure: low within the humps; small higher-frequency micro-oscillations appear near transitions but have little power.\\n  - STFT corroboration: elevated magnitude concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows in these mid windows.\\n  - Interpretation: these ordered, separated low-frequency bulges (small hump then larger hump) are positively attributed and used as mid-sequence signature features.\\n\\n- Red block C (late, lowest-frequency rows) \u2014 approx. t \u2248 104\u2013130 plus a final low-frequency positive contribution near the end t\u2248125\u2013143:\\n  - Manifestation in plot: a broad late trough centered near t\u2248110 (amplitude \u2248 -1.4) followed by a rapid-ish recovery and a final strong rise to the end (t=143) reaching \u2248+2.6. The recovery and terminal rise are lower-volatility, large-scale trends.\\n  - Amplitude & trend: the late trough-to-end rise is large (\u2248+3.8 from trough to final peak), with the final rise averaging roughly +0.12 to +0.20 units/step (faster than mid humps but still dominated by low-frequency energy).\\n  - STFT corroboration: again low-frequency energy concentrated at these late times.\\n  - Interpretation: the late trough plus strong final rise together provide substantial positive evidence per SHAP.\\n\\nSummary of local features: all strongly positively attributed regions are concentrated in the lowest STFT rows (very-low-frequency bands). They correspond to three main low-frequency events in the time series: (1) an early large descent to a wide trough (t\u22488\u201330), (2) mid-sequence smooth humps (t\u224836\u201391, two separated bulges), and (3) a late trough + broad recovery culminating in a strong final rise (t\u2248104\u2013143). Local volatility is low inside these events; higher-frequency ripples are weak in both STFT magnitude and SHAP attribution.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall feature analysis and temporal dependence:\\n\\n- Dominant trend & envelope: the sample is dominated by large-scale, low-frequency oscillatory structure (quasi-periodic broad peaks and troughs) across the entire 144 points. The global envelope shows 2\u20133 large undulations rather than many small cycles.\\n- Periodicity & frequency content: energy and SHAP attribution concentrate at the very-low-frequency bins in the STFT; thus the discriminative information is in long-wavelength contour segments, not in high-frequency details.\\n- Volatility profile: low volatility during the main humps/troughs (smooth ramps), with moderate slope changes at transitions. Occasional small high-frequency wiggles exist but carry negligible positive attribution (sometimes slightly negative).\\n- Temporal dependence & ordering: the classifier appears sensitive to the ordering and relative timing of these low-frequency events: an early large descent \u2192 mid-humps (smaller then larger) \u2192 late trough \u2192 strong terminal rise. The sequence of these broad features (their relative positions and amplitudes) composes the signature used by the model.\\n- Combination relationship: SHAP shows additive/compound positive contributions from multiple low-frequency events: early trough + mid humps + late trough/recovery together strengthen the class score. High-frequency transients (mid-frequency SHAP blue patches in some other classes) would detract, but here they are minimal.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching against label feature summaries and preliminary label selection:\\n\\n- Comparison to label summaries: The observed structure (early large positive offset then steep decline into wide trough; two mid low-frequency humps; a late wide trough plus rapid final rise; SHAP concentrated at lowest frequencies) matches the label_2 (F-14 wings closed) description closely. The provided label_2 summary explicitly lists positive SHAP at exactly the same time windows and describes the same low-frequency, multi-stage oscillatory form. The sample\u2019s STFT and SHAP patterns align strongly with the label_2 prototypical explanation.\\n- Contrast to other labels: Other label summaries (e.g., labels 0,1,4,5,6) also emphasize low-frequency components in many cases, but their characteristic timing/asymmetry differs (for example label_1 focuses strongly on a mid-window asymmetric cycle centered around ~39\u201395 with different ordering; label_4 centers a dominant mid hump around ~52\u201371 with different amplitude/asymmetry; label_3 shows multiple separated pulses but with a different arrangement of troughs/peaks). The most consistent match across timing, amplitude, ordering, STFT concentration and SHAP layout is label_2.\\n\\nPreliminary classification: label 2 (F-14 wings closed). Preliminary similarity score: 4 (high similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Reference-sample cross-check and final verification:\\n\\n- Similar-reference verification: the four provided 'similar' reference samples (labels 69, 63, 75, 58 \u2014 all labeled 2) show nearly identical time-domain shapes, STFT low-frequency patches at the same time windows, and SHAP red concentration in the lowest-frequency rows at the same time segments. Each reference exhibits the same early high \u2192 steep drop into wide trough, mid smooth humps, late trough and final rise pattern. This strong visual and spectral congruence confirms the sample-to-be-classified belongs to the same cluster as those label-2 examples.\\n- Dissimilar-reference verification: the two 'dissimilar' references (label 3 examples) show different time-domain morphologies \u2014 more pronounced intermediate-frequency content and different arrangement/phase of peaks/troughs \u2014 and their SHAP maps show more distributed attribution across frequencies (and different timing). They do not match the exact ordering and amplitude pattern of the test sample.\\n- Fairness & scoring logic: given the near one-to-one correspondence with multiple label-2 references and the explicit match with the label_2 feature description (same red/low-frequency windows, same amplitude ranges and same temporal ordering), assigning the highest similarity rating (4) to label_2 is justified. Other labels either lack the matching triple-window low-frequency signature or have different asymmetry/timing.\\n\\nFinal answer (after rechecking):\\n- Predicted label: label 2 (F-14 wings closed).\\n- Similarity score for chosen label: 4 (high similarity).\\n\\nConcise justification: the test sample exhibits the canonical label-2 signature \u2014 three main low-frequency events (early large descent to wide trough, mid smooth humps, late trough plus final strong rise) with SHAP concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows in those exact time windows and matching STFT energy \u2014 and closely matches multiple label-2 reference examples, so label 2 is the correct classification with high confidence.\"\n  ]\n}"

Interpretation: repeated low-frequency humps at these positions reinforce the class score.\",\n        \"4) Late trough + final rise (weaker positive SHAP near end window): The series drops to a deep late trough near t\u2248105\u2013115 (\u2248 -1.4 to -1.6) then recovers sharply, finishing at a large positive endpoint (~+2.6 at t=143).

Change rate of final rise is relatively large (~+0.15\u2013+0.2 units/step). Interpretation: the late trough + terminal rise forms part of the temporally ordered pattern the model uses.\",\n        \"Summary of Task 1: The SHAP-highlighted (red) regions all align with broad, low-frequency lobes in the signal at specific times: (early steep fall into wide trough around t\u224813\u201326), (mid humps around t\u224838\u201352 and t\u224860\u201380), and (a late trough then recovery).

The overall envelope shows ~2\u20133 slow undulations (quasi-periodic) rather than many small cycles.\",\n        \"2) Frequency & volatility: STFT shows most energy concentrated in the bottom frequency bins for the red-attributed windows. Local volatility is low within the main lobes (smooth ramps); higher-frequency micro-oscillations exist (notably between t\u224868\u201390) but they are low amplitude and have neutral/negative SHAP, so the model effectively ignores them or treats them as distracting.\",\n        \"3) Temporal dependence & ordering: The discriminative pattern is sequential: a large early descent \u2192 mid broad hump(s) \u2192 late trough \u2192 final recovery. The relative timing and ordering of these broad features (their positions along the time axis and amplitude relationships) are used by the classifier rather than isolated instantaneous spikes. In this sample the mid humps are separated by tens of steps and the early trough reliably precedes them (phase-like anchor), consistent with how the model weighs evidence.\",\n        \"\",\n        \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching sample features to label feature summaries (candidate labels):\",\n        \"I compared the above pattern against the provided label summaries.

Volatility is low inside the trough (smooth, few rapid oscillations).\\n- STFT support: concentrated energy at the very lowest frequency bins during the same time window, confirming this is a broad, slow curvature rather than a set of short spikes.\\n- Shape/substructure: a long-wavelength downward curvature (single smooth descent into a sustained trough), width ~12\u201318 steps.\\n\\nB) Mid-sequence low-frequency positive band (approx. t \u2248 39 \u2192 85, with several sub-peaks):\\n- Corresponding trace behavior: a series of broad, low-frequency lobes: a smooth rise to a modest positive peak around t\u224845\u201355 (~+0.6 to +0.8), descent to a small trough near t\u224855\u201360, then another smooth rise to a larger mid-peak around t\u224864\u201380 (~+0.6 to +0.8 again), and several smaller positive bumps around t\u224880\u201395. Each of these lobes has low internal volatility (smooth ramps) and occupies ~8\u201320 time steps. The local ascent rates are moderate (roughly +0.04 to +0.12 units/step) and descents vary (some are slightly steeper than the rises). Small high-frequency wiggles exist superimposed on the lobes but have much smaller amplitude (~0.1\u20130.3) and low STFT power; SHAP there is neutral or slightly negative.\\n- STFT support: the STFT shows elevated magnitude concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows during the mid windows (very low freq), confirming these are slow oscillations.\\n- Shape/substructure: ordered sequence of two-to-three broad humps (small hump \u2192 trough \u2192 larger hump \u2192 small rebound), i.e., low-frequency multi-lobe substructure.\\n\\nC) Late low-frequency positive band (approx. t \u2248 104 \u2192 130 and terminal rise t \u2248 130 \u2192 143):\\n- Corresponding trace behavior: a pronounced descent into a deep late trough (minimum around t\u2248110\u2013116 at \u2248\u22121.3 to \u22121.5) followed by a smooth recovery reaching near-zero around t\u2248125 and then a strong final monotonic rise from ~t=128 to the endpoint t=143 (ending at \u2248+2.7 to +2.8). The recovery and final rise are dominated by low-frequency energy and have moderate-to-high average slope during the final climb (~+0.15\u2013+0.2 units/step). Volatility during the trough is low; the final rise is smoother and low-volatility.\\n- STFT support: low-frequency energy reappears for the trough-to-rise window and the SHAP map shows positive attribution there, so the model treats the late trough + recovery + endpoint bulge as supportive evidence.\\n\\nTask 2 \u2014 Overall series features, combination and temporal dependence:\\n\\n- Global trend & envelope: The sequence shows a large positive offset at t=0, an initial steep fall to an early trough, a mid-section of several ordered low-frequency lobes, a late deep trough, and a final strong rise to a high endpoint. This produces a slow multi-lobe envelope across the 144 points: trough \u2192 hump(s) \u2192 trough \u2192 final hump.\\n- Periodicity & frequency content: The dominant energy is at very low frequencies (STFT concentrated at the bottom rows). The series is quasi-periodic at a low fundamental frequency: broad oscillations (periods on the order of tens of steps, ~30\u201350 steps between major extrema). High-frequency components are weak in power and generally not positively attributed.\\n- Volatility & change rates: Low volatility inside the broad lobes (smooth ramps). Transitions between lobes show larger instantaneous slopes (the earliest and final climbs/drops are among the steepest). Small, short-term wiggles appear in the mid region but are low amplitude and not strongly weighted by SHAP.\\n- Temporal dependence & ordering: The pattern is ordered: an early high baseline \u2192 deep early trough (~t\u224826\u201330) \u2192 mid dual-lobe sequence (~t\u224839\u201385) \u2192 late deep trough (~t\u2248104\u2013116) \u2192 final broad rise to endpoint (~t\u2248128\u2013143). This particular sequence and relative timing of broad, slow events is consistent and the SHAP map shows the classifier relies on these low-frequency events at specific times rather than isolated spikes.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature lists and selection of best label:\\n\\n- Comparison with the provided label summaries: Label 2 (F-14 wings closed) description emphasizes (i) a large early fall into a sustained trough around t\u224825 with strong low-frequency attribution, (ii) a mid-sequence moderate positive hump (~36\u201352) and another later hump (~65\u201391), and (iii) a pronounced late trough around t\u2248100\u2013125 followed by a final rapid rise to a large positive endpoint. The sample's real trace and SHAP windows align closely with these three hallmark windows (early trough, mid repeated humps, late trough + final rise). The STFT/SHAP pattern (positive at lowest frequencies at those exact windows) matches label 2's description almost point-for-point.\\n- For other labels: many emphasize low-frequency features too, but their temporal arrangement or signs differ (for instance label 1 mid-major asymmetric hump is centered differently; labels 0/4/5/6 have different dominant hump timings and asymmetries; label 3 shows a different pattern of troughs/peaks expected for wings-open).

This concordance reinforces the label-2 decision.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' references (both label 3 examples) show richer SHAP activity across higher-frequency rows and different mid/late timing of strong positive attribution; their waveforms have different placements of major lobes compared to sample 85.

The STFT confirms these time windows contain most energy in the bottom frequency bins (strong low-frequency magnitude where SHAP is red).\\n- Detailed (A) early window (t \u2248 0\u201326, strongest \u224813\u201326): amplitude and trend \u2014 the trace starts high (~+2.7 to +2.8 at t=0) and falls smoothly to a deep trough around t\u224825\u201328 at about -1.4 to -1.6. Net change about -4.0. Change rate: average downward slope ~-0.15 to -0.25 units/step over the interval (steeper at the start). Volatility: low within the descent (smooth, monotonic), STFT: dominant energy in the lowest frequency row. Shape/substructure: a large, wide downward curvature (long-wavelength trough) rather than short spikes. This exactly matches a low-frequency, large negative lobe that the model treats as positive evidence.\\n- Detailed (B) mid-sequence block (t \u2248 36\u201378): amplitude and substructure \u2014 the series rises from near zero after the early trough into a sequence of broad positive lobes: a moderate hump around t\u224842\u201350 (peak \u2248+0.6\u20130.8), then a drop to slightly negative near t\u224856, then another rise to a similar/ slightly larger hump near t\u224864\u201372 (peak \u2248+0.6\u20130.8). Change rates: rises are moderate (~+0.05\u2013+0.12 units/step), falls somewhat faster in places. Volatility: low inside each hump (smooth ramps), with small higher-frequency micro-wiggles of low amplitude (~0.1\u20130.3) superimposed but weak in STFT. SHAP red is concentrated on the lowest-frequency rows during these humps, telling the model values broad low-frequency curvature here.\\n- Detailed (C) late block and end (t \u2248 100\u2013143): amplitude and trend \u2014 after a descent into a late trough near t\u2248110 (\u2248-1.3 to -1.5) the series recovers and climbs to a large positive endpoint at t=143 (\u2248+2.7\u2013+2.8). The recovery / final rise is relatively steep (average slope in the final 20\u201325 steps ~ +0.12\u2013+0.18 units/step). STFT again shows low-frequency energy at the end and SHAP gives moderate positive weight in the bottom rows there. Volatility: the final climb is smoother than some mid-sequence transitions, dominated by low-frequency content.\\n- Frequency confirmation: STFT shows the majority of energy for the red-attributed windows sits at the lowest frequency bins (< ~0.05 normalized frequency). Higher-frequency rows show little energy during the major lobes; where mid-frequency energy does appear (transitions, some midpoints) SHAP is neutral or slightly negative, confirming the model prefers slow large-scale contour features.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall sample structure, temporal dependence, periodicity and volatility:\\n- Global description: The sample is a multi-lobe, low-frequency dominated trace comprising: an early high baseline then a steep, smooth fall to a wide trough; a mid-sequence pair of broad positive lobes (small hump then larger hump) with low volatility; a late deep trough followed by a final large positive rise to the end. This is a quasi-periodic, long-wavelength envelope rather than a high-frequency oscillation.\\n- Periodicity & spacing: The major extrema are spaced roughly 30\u201350 time steps apart (early trough ~25, mid humps ~45\u201372, late trough ~110, end peak 143), forming a consistent large-scale undulating pattern across the full 144 points.\\n- Volatility profile: Low within the broad lobes (smooth ramps), higher instantaneous slopes at transitions (the initial descent and final ascent are relatively steep). Small short-wavelength wiggles exist but have low amplitude and negligible STFT power; SHAP does not positively weight them.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: The classifier\u2019s positive SHAP mass aligns with the timing and ordering of the broad low-frequency lobes (early trough -> mid pair of humps -> late trough -> final rise). The ordering matters: the mid block\u2019s smaller hump followed by a larger hump and the late trough+recovery appear as a composite signature rather than isolated events.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and preliminary label selection (per-label similarity reasoning):\\n- Label 2 (F-14 wings closed) summary match: HIGH. The label_2 description emphasizes (i) early high -> steep fall into wide trough near t\u224825, (ii) mid and mid-late low-frequency humps around t\u224836\u201391 with strong low-frequency STFT energy, (iii) a late deep trough near t\u2248104\u2013125 then recovery and large final rise. The test sample shows these same three main low-frequency blocks, comparable amplitudes (early ~+2.7 to trough ~-1.5, mid hump peaks ~+0.6\u20130.8, late trough ~-1.4 and final rise >+2.5), and the SHAP / STFT alignment matches the label description closely. Similar reference samples 54, 30, 95 and 51 (all labeled 2.0) are visually near-identical in waveform, STFT and SHAP patterns to the test sample (same timing of lobes and same bottom-frequency SHAP concentration). => similarity score: 4/4.\\n- Label 3 (F-14 wings opened) summary match: LOW. Label_3 also relies on low-frequency lobes, but its characteristic patterns (per provided summary and the two dissimilar reference samples 17 & 43) show stronger negative troughs in different positions, stronger mid/high-frequency SHAP variations across more frequency rows, and different ordering/shape of mid events. The test sample\u2019s SHAP is concentrated at the lowest frequency rows and the timing/shape aligns better with label_2; dissimilar samples 17 and 43 have distinct multi-frequency SHAP patterns (more blue at mid frequencies) and different peak/trough morphology. => similarity score: 2/4.\\n- Other labels (0/Mirage, 1/Eurofighter, 4/Harrier, 5/F-22, 6/F-15): LOW to NO match. Those labels\u2019 summaries emphasise different timing/amplitude relationships (e.g., label_0 and label_1 focus on different mid-window asymmetries and magnitudes; label_4 centers a single dominant mid bump at ~52\u201370 but with different surrounding troughs; labels 5 & 6 show different hump spacing/amplitude and sometimes more emphasis on end behavior). The test sample\u2019s precise early steep drop to a wide trough near 25, followed by the two mid humps and late trough+final rise is specifically described in label_2\u2019s pattern and is not matched as closely by other labels. => similarity scores: likely 1\u20132/4 for these labels.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference examples and final verification of classification and scoring logic:\\n- Direct visual / attribution comparison to the four provided 'similar' reference samples (samples 54, 30, 95, 51) shows virtually identical waveform geometry (initial high -> deep trough near t\u224825 -> mid double-hump around t\u224840\u201375 -> late trough near t\u2248110 -> final rise to large endpoint) and almost identical STFT energy maps (bottom-row energy at the same time windows). Their SHAP heatmaps also concentrate red exactly in the same low-frequency rows and time windows. That strong congruence supports labeling the test sample as label 2.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' references (samples 17 and 43, label 3) show qualitative differences: they have more complex interleaving higher-frequency structures and broader SHAP patterns across multiple frequency rows (both red and blue) and different timing of major extrema. This confirms the test sample is not label 3.\\n- Consistency: The test-sample\u2019s low-frequency-dominated STFT + bottom-row SHAP red pattern is the defining signature the model learned for label_2 in the provided summary. All key measurable features (timing of troughs/peaks, amplitude ranges, smoothness/low volatility in lobes, and ordering) match label_2\u2019s description closely; thus an overall similarity rating of 4/4 is appropriate.\\n\\nFinal output decision: label 2 (F-14 wings closed). Confidence/score: 4 (high similarity) because the sample exhibits the canonical multi-lobe low-frequency pattern, amplitude ranges, timing, STFT energy and SHAP attribution described for label_2 and matched by multiple reference examples.\"\n    ]\n}",

Mapping those blocks to the time-series plot yields the following fine-grained features (all amplitudes and times are read from the plotted axes):\\n\\n- Early block (approx. t \u2248 0 \u2192 26, strongest around t \u2248 13\u201326): The series starts at a very large positive value (~+2.7 to +2.8 at t=0), falls to near 0 by t\u224813 and continues down to a broad trough near t\u224825\u201328 (min \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6). This is a large low-frequency downward swing (wide width \u2248 20\u201328 steps), smooth (low volatility inside the descent), average slope ~ -0.16 to -0.22 units/step over the descent. STFT confirms concentrated energy in the lowest frequency bins here, consistent with SHAP attribution. Shape: long monotonic fall into a wide basin (a broad, low-frequency valley).\\n\\n- Mid sequence block (approx. t \u2248 36 \u2192 85, strongest roughly 39\u219278): The series shows a smooth recovery from the early trough into a series of slow lobes: a moderate positive hump around t\u224840\u201352 (peak \u2248 +0.5\u2013+0.7), then a fall and another larger broad rise centered roughly t\u224864\u201378 (peak \u2248 +0.6\u2013+0.75). These mid events have low local volatility (smooth ramps), moderate positive slopes on the rises (~+0.05 to +0.15 units/step on ascents) and relatively gradual falls. STFT again shows low-frequency energy focused at the same times and SHAP low-frequency rows are red over these ranges. Substructure: the mid segment contains two separated low-frequency lobes (smaller then larger) with tens of steps between extrema, not high-frequency jitter.\\n\\n- Late block and terminal rise (approx. t \u2248 100 \u2192 143, strongest 104\u2192143): The trace declines again into a wide late trough centered around t\u2248104\u2013116 (min \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6) then recovers strongly to a very large terminal peak at t=143 (~+2.7 to +2.8). The final rise is relatively fast compared with mid ramps (average slope on final climb \u2248 +0.14\u2013+0.18 units/step) but still dominated by low-frequency content; SHAP low-frequency rows show positive attribution across the rising window. STFT shows renewed low-frequency power aligned to this terminal rise. The sharpness of the recovery is moderate compared with the very smooth mid lobes.\\n\\nIn all red-attributed windows the SHAP red is concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows, and the STFT confirms energy concentrated in the lowest bins during those times. Higher-frequency rows show little positive attribution (and sometimes neutral/negative values) \u2014 meaning the classifier rewards slow, broad contour features and disfavours sharp high-frequency texture here.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall sample characteristics and dependence: The sample is dominated by a low-frequency quasi-periodic envelope: (1) a very large initial positive offset, (2) a broad deep early trough, (3) two mid-sequence broad positive lobes (smaller then larger), (4) a pronounced late trough and (5) a strong terminal rise to a large positive endpoint. Volatility is low inside broad ramps and troughs; sharper transitions occur at segment boundaries (initial fall and final rise). The temporal ordering (high start \u2192 deep early trough \u2192 mid lobes \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise) and the spacing (~30\u201350 steps between major extrema) produce a multi-lobe, low-frequency signature rather than many rapid oscillations. The STFT confirms most signal energy relevant for classification is at very-low frequencies during the same time windows (consistent with SHAP). The classifier therefore relies on the timing, sign and amplitude of these large-scale lobes \u2014 not on high-frequency noise.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries: Comparing the above observations to the label summaries, Sample 85 strongly matches the label-2 (F-14 wings closed) description: that label\u2019s prototypical pattern includes an early large positive baseline followed by a steep decline to a wide trough (t\u22480\u201335), then mid and mid-late positive humps (\u224836\u201391), a pronounced late trough (\u2248100\u2013125) and a final rapid rise to a large positive endpoint. Both SHAP and STFT patterns (low-frequency red blocks in the same windows) match the label-2 explanation. Other labels (0,1,3,4,5,6) describe different timing/asymmetry patterns or emphasize different central windows (and in particular label-3 [wings opened] often shows alternate timing/shape), so they do not match as closely. Therefore label 2 gets the highest match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples: All four provided \\\"similar\\\" reference samples are labeled 2 and their plots, STFTs and SHAP heatmaps show essentially the same arrangement of large edge peaks, early trough around t~25\u201330, mid-lobes around 40\u201380, late trough ~100\u2013120 and terminal rise \u2014 including the same concentration of SHAP on the lowest-frequency bins in the same time windows. The two \\\"dissimilar\\\" references (label 3) show more varied mid-frequency SHAP patterns and different mid/early timing and amplitude patterns; they are visually distinct in the SHAP maps. This cross-check confirms the decision: Sample 85 is highly consistent with the label-2 prototypes and with the four label-2 reference samples. Given the near one-to-one match of events (timing, amplitude, low-frequency concentration and SHAP attribution) I rate similarity to label 2 as high (score = 4).\\n\\nFinal classification: label 2 (F-14 wings closed), similarity score 4 (high similarity).\"\n    ]\n}"

This is quasi-periodic at a low fundamental frequency \u2014 the STFT shows most energy at the lowest frequencies across these windows.\",\n    \"2) Volatility pattern: Volatility is heterogeneous: low within the broad lobes (smooth monotonic ramps), slightly higher during transitions (trough\u2192rise around t\u224824 and t\u2248104\u2013116). There are small high-frequency wiggles in the 60\u201380 window but they are low amplitude and given neutral-to-low SHAP weight.\",\n    \"3) Temporal combination and dependence: The classifier seems to treat the presence and ordering of these broad low-frequency lobes as a composite signature: an early high\u2192deep trough, followed by a mid positive hump, then a stronger mid-late bulge, and a late trough\u2192rise. The mid-late bulge (Region B) has the strongest SHAP weight and acts as a core anchor; the mid-early hump (Region A) and the late recovery (Region C) reinforce the class evidence. The ordering and relative amplitudes matter: single isolated lobes would be weaker evidence than this particular sequence.\",\n    \"Task 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and selection of best label:\",\n    \"1) Compare to label summaries: The label-2 (F-14 wings closed) summary explicitly describes a pattern of strong low-frequency positive SHAP at similar separated time windows, with prominent wide troughs and humps at early, mid and late times (notably mentions red blocks near t\u224813\u201326, t\u224878\u201391 and t\u2248104\u2013130). The test sample\u2019s red regions overlap strongly in time and frequency with that description: similar number of broad low-frequency lobes, similar amplitudes, and similar ordering (deep early trough, mid hump, strong mid-late hump, late trough\u2192rise).\",\n    \"2) Compare to other labels: Other label descriptions (e.g., labels 0,1,4,5,6) emphasize different distinct mid-window timings, asymmetries, or a single dominant central hump (Harrier label 4 has a single large mid hump around t\u224852\u201371). The test sample shows multiple lobes rather than one dominant isolated hump, matching label 2\u2019s multi-lobe description. Label 3 (F-14 wings opened) is similar family-wise but its examples show a different arrangement and deeper mid troughs/peaks at different times \u2014 the four provided similar training samples are label 2, not label 3.\",\n    \"3) Preliminary selection: Label 2 has the highest match: the mid/late positive SHAP concentration around t\u224878\u201391 is nearly the same location and strength described for label 2, and the multi-lobe low-frequency pattern matches the label-2 prototypical signature.\",\n    \"Task 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples:\",\n    \"1) Similar references: Four similar reference samples (samples 58, 63, 75, 69) are all labeled 2 and their plots, STFTs and SHAP heatmaps show nearly identical structure: early descent into a trough, mid-early hump near t\u224840\u201352, a strong mid-late bulge near t\u224872\u201392 with the bottom frequency rows red in SHAP, and a late trough and recovery. Visual shapes, amplitude ranges (troughs around -1.4 to -1.6, peaks around +0.7 to +2.6 at ends), and STFT low-frequency concentrations align closely with Sample 90. The provided SHAP blocks in these references are essentially the same timing and low-frequency emphasis as Sample 90. This strongly supports label 2.\",\n    \"2) Dissimilar references: Two dissimilar samples (labels 3) show more or different intermediate high-frequency structure and a different arrangement of troughs and peaks; their SHAP maps also have low-frequency attributions but in distinct patterns and some stronger mid-frequency variations (blue areas at mid freqs) not present in Sample 90. This difference confirms Sample 90 is closer to label 2 references than to label 3.\",\n    \"3) Scoring fairness & consistency: Given the near one-to-one correspondence of the strong red low-frequency SHAP blocks in Sample 90 with those of multiple label-2 references, the mapping is robust. The sample\u2019s multi-lobe low-frequency sequence and amplitudes match label 2\u2019s feature description closely. Therefore a high-similarity rating is appropriate.\",\n    \"Final decision and quantified similarity:\",\n    \"1) Chosen label: label 2 (F-14 wings closed).\",\n    \"2) Similarity score: 4 (High similarity). Rationale for score: The test sample shares the same multi-lobe low-frequency pattern, nearly identical timing of the strongest positive-attribution windows (mid-early hump, strongest mid-late hump, late recovery), similar amplitude ranges, and matching STFT low-frequency concentration with multiple label-2 reference samples. The SHAP-attributed regions and spectral energy align strongly with the label-2 pattern description, and dissimilar labels show clear differences.\",\n    \"Summary (concise): Sample 90 is driven to its class by three separated, low-frequency, broad lobes (not high-frequency spikes). These lobes occur at the same time positions and with similar amplitudes and shapes described for label 2 in the documentation and shown by multiple reference examples. After cross-checking STFT, SHAP and reference samples, label 2 is the best match with high confidence (score = 4).\"\n  ]\n}",

These align with the following plot windows and features:\\n  1) Mid window ~t \u2248 36\u201355: In the time series this maps to a smooth low-volatility ascent from a negative trough to a local positive hump. Amplitude: roughly from about -1.6 (near t\u224826\u201330) up to \u2248+0.7\u2013+0.9 (peak around t\u224848\u201352). Change rate: average upward slope \u2248 +0.08 to +0.12 units/time-step across the rise. Volatility/substructure: the rise is dominated by a single broad curvature (no high-frequency spikes), small sub-wiggles (~0.05\u20130.2) only. STFT: elevated energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins across this interval, confirming a slow, long-wavelength feature. SHAP: strong red at the bottom freq rows \u2014 this region contributes strongly and positively to the predicted label.\\n  2) Late-mid window ~t \u2248 72\u201396: Corresponds to another broad low-frequency positive contribution in SHAP. Plot manifestation: a moderate positive excursion around t\u224878\u201390 (peaks near \u2248+0.5 to +0.7) preceded and followed by troughs. Change rate: moderate slopes on rise and fall, low volatility inside the hump. STFT: again low-frequency energy; SHAP: positive low-frequency attribution concentrated here (reinforcing evidence).\\n  3) Final window ~t \u2248 120\u2013143 (end ramp): SHAP shows low-frequency positive values (weaker than the two central blocks but still present). Plot manifestation: a strong final upward ramp from ~-1.3 (around t\u2248116) to a large endpoint \u2248+2.6 at t=143. Change rate: comparatively fast final rise (\u2248+0.14\u2013+0.18 units/time-step locally), but still dominated by low-frequency content in STFT. SHAP: low-frequency rows show moderate positive weight near the sequence end.\\n- Additional local observations: the sequence begins at a high positive value (\u2248+2.6 at t=0) then exhibits a steep early descent (t\u22480\u201326) into the first deep trough (\u2248-1.6). That early high\u2192deep trough transition carries low-frequency energy and some positive SHAP in neighboring low-frequency rows (the classifier treats the timing/shape of that descent as informative). Short, faster wiggles (mid-frequency) appear intermittently (notably around t\u224860\u201372 and t\u224888\u2013100) but STFT and SHAP indicate these higher-frequency components are low-power and either neutral or slightly negative in attribution (they do not drive the positive label score).\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series summary and how features combine:\\n- Global trend & periodicity: The sample is dominated by large-scale, slow oscillations (broad trough\u2013peak\u2013trough cycles) across ~144 points \u2014 effectively 2\u20133 low-frequency lobes. The STFT shows most energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during the main lobes; SHAP consistently highlights those same low-frequency rows. This indicates the model relies on coarse contour-scale features rather than fine texture.\\n- Volatility and change-rate profile: Volatility is low inside the broad lobes (smooth ramps), higher only at transition edges (the early descent and the final rise are relatively steeper). The largest slopes are the early downward ramp (t\u22480\u201326, steep negative) and the final upward ramp (t\u2248120\u2013143, steep positive). Middle lobes are gentler.\\n- Temporal dependence and combination: The classifier appears to combine multiple separated low-frequency events additively \u2014 an early high then deep trough, a mid positive hump, another mid/late hump, a late trough and final recovery \u2014 and gives most weight to the timing and amplitude of the mid/late low-frequency bulges. The relative ordering (early descent \u2192 mid hump \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise) is consistent with a temporally-ordered signature the model recognizes.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries (candidate selection + similarity scoring rationale):\\n- Quick map to label summaries:\\n  * Label 2 (F-14 wings closed) summary describes: an early large positive value then steep fall into a wide trough (t\u22480\u201335), a mid-sequence smooth positive hump (~36\u201352), another positive hump later (~65\u201391), a late wide trough (~100\u2013125) followed by a rapid final rise to a large positive endpoint. SHAP for label_2 examples is concentrated in lowest frequency rows at roughly the same time blocks. This matches the test sample closely in timing, amplitude, low-frequency dominance, and ordering of events.\\n  * Label 3 (F-14 wings opened) also shows multiple low-frequency lobes but its characteristic substructure and distribution of trough/peak depths and the relative timing of positive pulses differ (and the provided dissimilar examples show stronger/earlier mid positive pulses and different SHAP distribution across mid frequencies).\\n  * Other labels (0,1,4,5,6) emphasize different mid-window signatures (different timing or asymmetry of bulges) in their summaries; the test sample\u2019s exact arrangement of early steep descent, mid hump around t\u224848, a second mid/late hump and late trough+final rise aligns best with label 2.\\n- Quantified similarity judgment (per labeling rubric):\\n  * Label 2: score = 4 (high similarity). Reason: nearly all key elements in the label_2 pattern are present (early high \u2192 steep fall into trough, mid hump ~39\u201355, later hump and late trough, strong final rise), STFT/SHAP frequency/temporal alignment matches, and the four provided similar reference samples are labeled 2 and look almost identical in waveform, STFT and SHAP.\\n  * Label 3: score = 2 (low similarity). Reason: while label_3 is another F-14 variant and also has low-frequency lobes, the dissimilar reference samples for label 3 show different mid-window shapes and stronger positive attribution spread into mid/high frequencies; the timing and sign of the main low-frequency lobes in those label_3 samples do not align as closely with the test sample as label_2 does.\\n  * Labels 0,1,4,5,6: score = 1\u20132 (no-to-low similarity). Reason: their canonical signature windows and shapes (as summarized) differ in the ordering, amplitude and location of principal low-frequency lobes from this test sample. For example, label_4 (Harrier) emphasizes a dominant single mid hump at different timing and asymmetry; label_1 and label_5 have different mid-lobe timing and amplitude patterns; label_0 and label_6 show other characteristic patterns not matching the exact trough/hump ordering here.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Reference-sample verification and final check:\\n- Visual cross-check with provided similar reference samples (Samples 58, 63, 75, 69 \u2014 all labeled 2): their waveforms, STFTs and SHAP maps are nearly the same as the test sample: same early-high then deep trough, mid hump near t\u224848, subsequent hump and late trough, final rapid rise; STFTs show low-frequency energy aligned to the same windows; SHAP maps concentrate red in lowest-frequency rows at the same times. This strongly supports assigning the test sample to label 2.\\n- Contrast with dissimilar examples (Samples 87 and 104 labeled 3): those show more pronounced oscillatory content in some mid-frequency rows and slightly different timing/phase of peaks and troughs; their SHAP maps distribute attribution differently across frequency bands. The differences confirm that label 3 is less likely here.\\n\\nConclusion (final classification):\\n- Chosen label: label 2 (F-14 wings closed).\\n- Final similarity score for chosen label: 4 (high similarity), because the sample matches the label_2 feature summary and the four similar reference samples closely in waveform shape, timing of key low-frequency lobes, STFT energy concentration, and SHAP low-frequency attribution.\"\n  ]\n}",

STFT shows some mid-frequency energy there; the model penalizes those sharper local features compared with broad, smooth lobes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and relationships between features:\\n- Global shape: the series is dominated by a small number (3\u20134) of broad, low-frequency lobes (an early descent into a trough, a large mid/late positive pulse, additional mid troughs and a final endpoint rise). Energy in the STFT concentrates in the lowest frequency bins during the time windows identified by the SHAP map. This indicates the classifier relies on large-scale contour features rather than fine-grained texture.\\n- Periodicity & ordering: quasi-periodic slow undulations occur with approximate spacing of tens of steps (roughly 30\u201350 steps between consecutive extrema). The order of events is consistent (high start \u2192 big early fall \u2192 mid oscillations \u2192 deep/secondary troughs \u2192 large late positive pulse \u2192 final rise). The model emphasizes the temporal sequence (phase) \u2014 the early trough reliably precedes the discriminative late positive pulse in this sample.\\n- Volatility: within the large lobes volatility is low (smooth ramps); in transition windows there are steeper slopes and localized mid-frequency energy (these are either neutral or slightly negative for the class). Between ~56\u201385 there are small higher-frequency wiggles (low amplitude) which are not strongly attributed.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists and selection of label:\\n- The described local and global features (strong low-frequency, broad early negative swing around t\u224810\u201326; additional deep troughs; a pronounced mid/late positive pulse around t\u224892\u2013106; and a strong terminal rise) align closely with the pattern described for label 3 (F-14 wings opened) in the summary: label 3 explicitly highlights an early large low-frequency downward deflection (t\u224810\u201326), a deep trough mid-sequence, mid-sequence small high-frequency oscillations that are neutral, and a strong large-scale upward swing near t\u224892\u2013106 plus final rise. The SHAP and STFT corroborate that the classifier is using those low-frequency lobes the label-3 description lists.\\n- Alternative labels: label 2 (F-14 wings closed) shares some features (early steep decline and multiple low-frequency troughs) so partial similarity exists, but the exact timing and presence of the strong late positive pulse and the mid structure match label 3 more closely. Most other labels emphasize different timing (e.g., label 4 centers a big hump around t\u224852\u201371) which is not the primary discriminative window here.\\n- Therefore the highest match is label 3 (F-14 wings opened). Based on the near one-to-one agreement between the sample\u2019s SHAP-highlighted low-frequency windows, STFT energy, time ordering and amplitudes and the label-3 feature description, I give label 3 a high similarity score.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four provided 'similar' reference samples are all labeled 3.0 and their plots, STFTs and SHAP heatmaps nearly match the test sample in: early large descent to a trough, a deep mid trough near ~50, small mid-frequency wiggles, a large positive pulse around ~104, and a final endpoint rise. The SHAP low-frequency red blocks align in timing and frequency band with the test sample. This strong correspondence verifies the classification decision and justifies a top similarity rating.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' reference samples (label 4) show different mid-window dominant hump timing and STFT energy distribution and their SHAP maps concentrate differently; they do not match the key discriminative windows of the test sample, confirming they are not the correct class.\\n\\nFinal assignment: label 3 (F-14 wings opened). Rationale for score: 4 (high similarity) because the test sample contains the same low-frequency, temporally-ordered lobes, amplitudes, and SHAP-attributed windows described in the label-3 feature summary and mirrored in the provided label-3 reference samples.\"\n    ]\n}",

The SHAP heatmap shows these as the strongest, contiguous red areas and the STFT confirms energy concentrated at the very low frequencies there (bottom rows bright in STFT at same times).\\n- Corresponding waveform features (early block, t \u2248 10\u201340): the trace falls from a large positive starting value (~+2.6 at t=0) through a smooth monotonic descent to a deep trough near t\u224818\u201322 (\u2248 -1.4 to -1.6), then a broad, low-volatility rebound up to a local peak (~+1.4\u2013+1.6) by t\u224832\u201336. Characteristics: large amplitude swing (~3.8\u20134.0 units from early peak to trough), low volatility inside these events (smooth ramps), average slopes of the major segments are relatively steep on the descent (~-0.15 to -0.22 units/step) and moderate on the rebound (~+0.12\u2013+0.15 units/step). STFT shows this entire event is dominated by the lowest frequency bins, matching the SHAP attribution.\\n- Corresponding waveform features (mid-to-late block, t \u2248 92\u2013110): a pronounced low-frequency positive pulse/rise is visible near t\u224892\u2013106 where the signal climbs rapidly from a negative valley (~-1.8) up to a positive hump (~+1.2 to +1.4). This rise is again broad (many steps) and strongly concentrated at very low frequencies in STFT; the SHAP map gives strong positive attribution at the bottom rows for roughly t\u224892\u2013106. The change rate on that rise is high compared with small wiggles but still low-frequency in spectral content (large-scale pulse rather than a high-frequency spike).\\n- Secondary red support near the sequence end: SHAP shows modest positive weight at low frequency close to the terminal region (t\u2248130\u2013143). The time series has a later final rise to large positive endpoint (~+2.6 at t=143). STFT shows reappearance of low-frequency energy there, and SHAP gives a weaker but positive contribution consistent with that final broad bulge.\\n- Non-attributed / negative bands: Several mid-frequency rows show neutral or slightly blue SHAP in places where the time series exhibits faster transitions (e.g., sharper falls) \u2014 the model downweights mid/high-frequency content. The STFT shows elevated mid-frequency energy where slopes are steeper; SHAP often colors those rows neutral/blue, indicating the classifier prefers the slow, broad features.\\n- In summary for Task 1: the classifier\u2019s positively attributed features are broad, low-frequency lobes appearing early (big descent then broad rebound), mid-late (large slow rise/pulse around t\u224892\u2013106) and a supporting final broad rise. These events are large in amplitude (range roughly -1.8 to +2.6), low in volatility inside each lobe, and have clear low-frequency spectral signatures in STFT.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series-level characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Global trend & periodicity: the series exhibits quasi-periodic, large-scale undulations across the whole 144 points: an initial high positive baseline, a large downward lobe, a rebound to a mid positive lobe, another deep trough later, a strong low-frequency positive pulse in the late-mid portion, then a final rise to a high endpoint. The dominant power is concentrated at the lowest frequencies in STFT over the key windows, indicating the signal is governed by slow, broad curvature rather than repeated high-frequency cycles.\\n- Volatility: volatility is heterogeneous \u2014 low within the broad lobes (smooth monotonic rises/falls) and relatively higher around the steeper transitions; however these higher-frequency transients are weaker in spectral power and usually provide neutral or negative SHAP values. Overall the sample is low-volatility at the times that the model considers important.\\n- Temporal dependence and combination: the classifier appears to combine multiple spatially-separated low-frequency lobes additively: the early trough\u2192broad rebound, the mid troughs/small oscillations, and especially the late big low-frequency pulse together form a composite temporal signature. The ordering matters: the early descent and the late positive pulse each receive strong positive attribution and together are a coherent pattern across the sample.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature summaries and selection of best label:\\n- Comparing the extracted local and global patterns to the label summaries: label 3 (F-14 wings opened) description emphasizes multiple separated low-frequency lobes (an early large smooth downward deflection near t\u224810\u201326, deep trough mid sequence, a large late positive swing near t\u224892\u2013106, and a final rise), with SHAP concentrated at the lowest frequency rows for the same time windows. This matches our sample very closely in timing, sign, amplitude, and low-frequency dominance. The four similar training references shown are all label 3 and their waveforms, STFTs, and SHAP heatmaps are visually nearly identical to the test sample across the same time windows \u2014 further corroborating the match.\\n- Label 2 (F-14 wings closed) also uses multiple low-frequency troughs and peaks at specific windows and can be similar in overall low-frequency multi-lobe structure; however its canonical mid/late arrangement described in the summary differs slightly in the relative sign/timing of some lobes from our sample and the provided closest training neighbors are labeled 3, not 2. So label 2 is somewhat similar but not as tight a match as label 3.\\n- Labels 0,1,5,6 all emphasize low-frequency content in parts, but their distinctive temporal patterns (e.g., mid-centered large positive hump for label 1, a central strong hump for label 4/Harrier, the particular asymmetries described for Mirage or F-22) are not the best match to the exact ordering and sign of the lobes we observe. Label 4 (Harrier) notably expects a dominant positive mid hump ~t=52\u201371 \u2014 our sample has a trough there, so it is inconsistent.\\n- Therefore the highest matching label is label 3 (F-14 wings opened). I assign similarity scores (1\u20134) comparing the test sample to each label's canonical description and the supplied references as follows (labels 0 through 6):\\n  - label 0 (Mirage): 2 \u2014 shares low-frequency large-scale structure in general but timing/sign pattern differs.\\n  - label 1 (Eurofighter): 2 \u2014 both emphasize mid/late low-frequency shapes but the precise asymmetric mid hump for label 1 is not present here.\\n  - label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 3 \u2014 some similar multi-lobe low-frequency structure and troughs exist, but timing/sign differences vs. the wings-closed canonical pattern reduce the match.\\n  - label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 4 \u2014 high similarity in the number, timing, sign and low-frequency character of main lobes; reference examples are nearly identical in appearance and SHAP/STFT alignment.\\n  - label 4 (Harrier): 1 \u2014 key hallmark is a dominant mid positive hump where our sample has a trough; low match.\\n  - label 5 (F-22): 2 \u2014 low-frequency lobes exist in both but our central trough vs. expected hump makes the match weak.\\n  - label 6 (F-15): 2 \u2014 shares persistent low-frequency envelope, but F-15 penalizes sharp mid-frequency transitions and expects a different envelope shape; only a modest match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against the provided reference samples and consistency check:\\n- Visual cross-check: the four provided 'similar' reference plots (Samples 14, 89, 104, 67) are all labeled 3 and are visually nearly identical to the test sample in waveform shape, relative timing of troughs/peaks, STFT low-frequency concentration, and SHAP positive blocks at the same time positions. This strongly supports choosing label 3.\\n- Consistency with label summaries: the detailed textual pattern given for label 3 in the summary matches the test sample\u2019s identified features (early large downward low-frequency lobe, deep mid trough, late positive pulse and final rise). The SHAP heatmap for the test sample also shows red concentrated exactly where the label-3 summary says the model should focus, and the STFT low-frequency energy corroborates it.\\n- Fairness and scoring logic: I rated label 3 as 4 because both the numerical trace and the attribution (SHAP) + spectral (STFT) evidence match the label-3 signature strongly. Label 2 got 3 because it is the most plausible second-best (similar multi-lobe low-frequency structure) but differences in sign/timing and the available references favor label 3. The remaining labels get 1\u20132 depending on whether their canonical discriminants (timing, sign of main hump/trough) align at all with the sample.\\n\\nFinal answer: predicted label is label 3 (F-14 wings opened).

This decline is smooth, low-volatility and sustained (rough average slope \u2248 -0.18 to -0.25 units/step). STFT shows concentrated energy in the very-low-frequency bins in the same window. Interpretation: a large slow downward curvature (broad contour indentation) that the model positively attributes.\\n- Secondary SHAP-positive low-frequency block B (approx. t \u2248 46\u201354, lowest freq): corresponds to a pronounced, wide negative trough centered near t\u224848\u201352 (amplitude about -2.0 to -2.1). The trough is broad (8\u201312 steps wide), low local volatility inside it, and STFT again concentrates energy at the lowest frequency. Interpretation: a deep broad valley that is highly diagnostic and positively weighted by SHAP.\\n- Tertiary SHAP-positive low-frequency block C (approx. t \u2248 92\u2013106, lowest freq): on the time series this aligns with a large, fairly rapid upward pulse beginning from a negative baseline (~-1.8) and rising to a strong positive peak (~+1.3 to +1.4) over ~12\u201315 steps (average slope \u2248 +0.20\u2013+0.25). STFT shows low-frequency energy here as well. Interpretation: a big low-frequency positive pulse (large-scale rise) that the model uses as positive evidence.\\n- Smaller/late low-frequency positive area (t \u2248 130\u2013143): corresponds to the final sustained rise from ~-0.9/ -1.1 back up to the end-point ~+2.5\u2013+2.6. This is lower SHAP intensity than the prior three but still positive and low-frequency in STFT.\\n- High-frequency / mid-frequency bands: STFT shows little energy there during the major lobes; the SHAP heatmap has neutral/mildly negative colors in mid-frequency rows during some steeper transitions (e.g., the drop after the big central trough), indicating the classifier disfavors sharp/high-frequency texture. In the time trace those steeper transitions show slightly higher instantaneous slopes and small ripples, but they are not the main positively attributed features.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and internal relationships:\\n- Dominant behaviour: the sample is dominated by a small number (3\u20134) of large, slow (very-low-frequency) undulations over the 144 points: an early large descent (t\u22480\u2192~20), a deep mid trough (~48), a later large positive pulse (~92\u2013106), and a final broad rise to the end (~130\u2013143). These form a broad trough\u2013peak\u2013trough\u2013peak-like envelope.\\n- Volatility: volatility is heterogeneous \u2014 very low (smooth monotonic ramps) inside the large lobes and troughs; somewhat higher (small wiggles) in the mid-range between the large events, but these faster components have low STFT power and low (often neutral or negative) SHAP attribution.\\n- Frequency content: STFT shows most energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during the big events; higher-frequency bands are weak. SHAP aligns with STFT: positive attribution is concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows for the main time windows, confirming the model relies on slow, global contour features rather than local spikes.\\n- Temporal dependence and ordering: the discriminative pattern is the sequence and relative timing of large-scale lobes: an early broad descent \u2192 a deep central trough \u2192 a later large positive pulse \u2192 final rise. The order and amplitude relationships matter (the early descent preceding the central trough and the late positive pulse following it) and the classifier treats these events additively (multiple positively attributed low-frequency lobes strengthen the label evidence).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries (which label best matches?):\\n- Compare with label 3 (F-14 wings opened) summary: the summary explicitly lists: strong low-frequency negative swing around t\u224810\u201326, a pronounced deep trough near t\u224848\u201354, a large positive pulse/rapid rise around t\u224892\u2013106 and a final sustained rise \u2014 all with strong positive SHAP at the lowest frequency rows. This is a near one-to-one match in timing, sign, amplitude and SHAP localization. The STFT/SHAP pattern in the sample is essentially the same as the label-3 description.\\n- Compare with other labels: other classes (labels 0,1,2,4,5,6) also emphasize low-frequency lobes but differ in the relative ordering, polarity and timing of their strongest positive features. For instance label 4 (Harrier) centers its strongest positive evidence on a dominant mid-segment positive hump near t\u224852\u201371 (single large center bump), which does not align with this sample's deep trough near 48 and the particular early descent \u2192 central trough \u2192 later positive pulse sequence. Label 2 has some repeated trough/hump structure but its pattern and the strongest windows differ in timing and relative signs; label 3 matches both qualitatively and quantitatively.\\n- Therefore label 3 is the best match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples:\\n- The four 'similar' training examples are all labeled 3.0 and their time series, STFT and SHAP maps are visually nearly identical to the test sample: same early high start and smooth early fall (~t=0\u201325), an identical deep trough near ~48\u201352, similar small mid oscillations and a pronounced positive pulse around ~104\u2013110 followed by final rise. Their SHAP maps show the same concentrated red at lowest-frequency rows in the identical time windows (especially early and the late-mid pulse). This strongly confirms the assignment.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' reference samples (label 4) show a different primary discriminative feature in both time series and STFT/SHAP: label 4 references present a dominant mid-centered positive hump (t\u224852\u201371) and different low-frequency attribution blocks; their waveform symmetry and main-event timing do not match the test sample's central trough + later positive pulse pattern. This supports the distinction and reduces risk of mislabeling.\\n\\nFinal decision and scoring justification:\\n- Final predicted label: label 3 (F-14 wings opened). Rationale: near-perfect alignment between this sample's positively SHAP-weighted low-frequency windows (timing, sign, amplitude, smoothness) and the label-3 feature summary and reference examples. STFT corroborates that the positively attributed events are low-frequency, matching the class signature.\\n- Similarity score: 4 (high similarity). Justification: the exact windows, amplitude levels, smooth/trough/peak ordering, and SHAP localization appear in both the test sample and multiple label-3 references; the qualitative and quantitative match is strong across time-domain shape, STFT frequency localization and SHAP attribution.\"\n    ]\n}"

The STFT shows matching high energy in the lowest-frequency bin at those same windows, confirming the model is using slow / large-scale components there.\\n- Early window (t \u2248 8\u201326): amplitude drops from a high starting value (t=0 \u2248 +2.6) down through zero to a broad trough (minimum \u2248 -1.4\u2026-1.6). Shape: a smooth, monotonic negative swing with low local volatility (no high-frequency jitter inside the descent). Change rate: average slope roughly -0.15 to -0.25 units/step over ~15\u201318 steps (a fast, large smooth descent at low frequency). STFT: energy concentrated at the 0\u20130.05 normalized-frequency band; SHAP: strong positive attribution in those low-frequency rows \u2014 the model treats this broad downward curvature as strongly supportive evidence.\\n- Mid trough (t \u2248 46\u201352): the trace reaches a deep negative minimum near t\u224850 (\u2248 -2.0). This trough is broad and low-volatility (wide, smooth valley) and STFT again shows low-frequency power here. SHAP on low frequencies around this time is positive/neutral, indicating the trough is part of the discriminative low-frequency pattern.\\n- Middle band (t \u2248 52\u201390): a sequence of small, higher-frequency oscillations appears (amplitudes roughly \u00b10.2\u20130.6). STFT shows modest mid-frequency content here; SHAP in mid-frequency rows is mostly neutral or slightly negative \u2014 the classifier does not treat these small wiggles as positive evidence and sometimes penalizes mid-frequency spikes.\\n- Prominent positive pulse (t \u2248 92\u2013106): the waveform rises rapidly from a deep negative value (~ -1.8) to a large positive peak (~ +1.3 to +1.4). Net change ~+3.0 over \u224812\u201314 steps (average slope roughly +0.20 to +0.25 units/step). STFT: energy concentrated again at the lowest-frequency rows for this window and SHAP shows strong red at that bottom band \u2014 the model strongly credits this large slow rise+peak as positive evidence. The shape is an asymmetric low-frequency pulse (fast rise relative to some prior slow features but still dominated by low-frequency energy).\\n- End segment (t \u2248 125\u2013143): a final broad rise to a large endpoint value (~ +2.5 at t=143). STFT indicates renewed low-frequency energy and SHAP shows modest positive attribution at the lowest-frequency rows here; this terminal broad bulge adds supporting evidence but is weaker than the mid positive pulse.\\n\\nTask 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and dependence:\\n- Global trend & envelope: the series is dominated by a small number of large, slow undulations (low-frequency lobes and troughs) separated by regions of small oscillatory detail. Major events in order: high positive start \u2192 fast broad descent to early trough (t\u22488\u201326) \u2192 large negative trough around t\u224850 \u2192 a series of small oscillations (t\u224852\u201390) \u2192 large low-frequency positive pulse (t\u224892\u2013106) \u2192 descent to a moderate trough and final sustained rise to sequence end.\\n- Periodicity & frequency content: energy is concentrated primarily in the very-low-frequency band (confirmed by STFT bright spots at the bottom rows aligned with the main lobes). Higher-frequency content is limited to localized pockets (small wiggles in middle) and is not credited by SHAP \u2014 in fact mid-frequency content near rapid transitions is often neutral-to-negative.\\n- Volatility and slopes: within the main lobes/troughs volatility is low (smooth ramps), while the rapid rise near t\u224892\u2013106 is relatively steep (high slope) but still dominated by low-frequency energy (broad pulse, not a narrow spike). Small mid-sequence wiggles are higher-frequency but low amplitude and are not major drivers.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: the classifier appears to combine multiple separated low-frequency events (early descent + mid trough + large mid/late positive pulse + final rise) as additive evidence. The ordering and relative amplitudes matter: the early broad descent and later large low-frequency positive pulse are especially strongly weighted by the model for this sample.\\n\\nTask 3 \u2014 Match to label patterns (does the label patterns list include this sample\u2019s pattern?):\\n- Compare to label summaries:\\n  - Label 3 (F-14, wings opened): summary describes an early strong low-frequency downward swing (t\u224810\u201326), a pronounced deep trough mid-sequence (t\u224848\u201354), small higher-frequency oscillations in the middle (t\u224860\u201385), a pronounced large positive rise around t\u224892\u2013106 (rise from ~-1.8 to +1.4, net ~+3.2 over ~14 steps), and a final sustained rise. This matches the sample very closely in time placement, amplitude, shape, volatility, STFT low-frequency alignment, and SHAP attribution. High similarity.\\n  - Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): also emphasizes multiple low-frequency troughs and humps across early/mid/late windows (early fall, mid humps, late trough and recovery). The sample shares many low-frequency multi-lobe properties (early fall, mid trough, final rise) but the defining strong positive mid/late pulse at \u224892\u2013106 is more characteristic in the label-3 description. Moderate similarity.\\n  - Labels 0,1,5,6: all mention dominant low-frequency energy and broad lobes but at different characteristic timings and shapes (e.g., label 0 emphasizes mid-window slow rise centered ~26\u201365 and strong end rises at different placements; label 1 emphasizes a mid-window asymmetric large hump ~39\u201395 but with different phase/order; label 5 and 6 have different combinations of lobes and asymmetries). The sample\u2019s exact ordering (early large descent \u2192 deep mid trough at ~50 \u2192 small oscillatory zone \u2192 large positive pulse at ~92\u2013106 \u2192 final rise) aligns most directly with label 3 and to a lesser degree label 2; it is less consistent with label 4 (Harrier) whose primary discriminative element is a dominant mid hump around t\u224852\u201371. Low-to-moderate similarity for these labels.\\n\\nTask 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision:\\n- The provided four \u201csimilar\u201d reference samples are all labeled 3 and their plots + STFT + SHAP patterns match the same signature: large positive start, fast early downward swing, deep trough ~50, small higher-frequency mid wiggles, and a pronounced positive pulse near t\u2248104 with strong low-frequency SHAP red \u2014 they are visually and spectrally near-identical to the test sample. This strongly supports label 3.\\n- The two dissimilar references are labeled 4; their central dominant hump and STFT/SHAP patterns differ (their strongest low-frequency attribution is at a different time window), confirming that label 4 is not a good fit.\\n\\nSimilarity scoring (per-label; 1\u20134 where 4 = high similarity):\\n  - label 0 (Mirage): 2 (shares general low-frequency lobes but timing/ordering and pulses do not match key Mirage windows)\\n  - label 1 (Eurofighter): 2 (some low-frequency asymmetry in mid region in common, but the precise sequence and the strong pulse at t\u224892\u2013106 are not a match)\\n  - label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 multiple troughs/humps are shared, but the distinctive large low-frequency pulse timing better matches label 3)\\n  - label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 4 (high similarity \u2014 nearly all descriptive points in the label-3 pattern list match the sample: early large descent, deep trough ~50, mid small wiggles, large positive pulse \u224892\u2013106, final rise; STFT & SHAP align)\\n  - label 4 (Harrier): 1 (dominant mid hump for Harrier is in a different time window and sample lacks the Harrier single dominant mid bulge signature)\\n  - label 5 (F-22): 2 (some multi-lobe low-frequency features in common but not matching the distinctive trough/pulse ordering here)\\n  - label 6 (F-15): 2 (shared low-frequency envelope elements but key transitions and the positively attributed pulse at t\u224892\u2013106 conflict with F-15 description which penalizes sharp mid-frequency transitions)\\n\\nFinal check and conclusion: the time ordering, amplitudes, slopes, low-frequency STFT energy, and SHAP attribution pattern of the test sample align extremely well with the label-3 (F-14 wings opened) profile and the provided label-3 reference samples. After cross-checking against other label summaries and reference samples, label 3 is the most consistent classification. Final output: label 3 with high similarity score 4.\"\n  ]\n}",

This segment is a low-frequency, low-volatility monotonic downward ramp of ~-4.0 units over ~18 steps (avg slope \u2248 -0.22 units/step for the fastest portion); STFT shows concentrated energy in the lowest frequency rows in the same window. Shape/substructure: clear long-wavelength descent (broad concavity) with little high-frequency jitter \u2014 a classic slow, large-scale negative lobe.\\n- Secondary positive-attribution region B (SHAP low-frequency red) \u2014 time steps ~100\u2013130: In the time series there is a large, rapid low-frequency positive pulse centered roughly t\u2248100\u2013108 (rise from roughly -1.8 up to ~+1.3 by t\u2248105, a net change \u2248 +3.1 over ~14 steps, avg slope \u2248 +0.22) followed by a descent into a moderate trough and then a strong final sustained rise from ~t\u2248130 to 143 reaching ~+2.6. STFT again shows most energy at the lowest frequency rows for the pulse and for the terminal rise. Volatility: the pulse rise is relatively steep compared with earlier slow ramps but still dominated by low-frequency energy (i.e., it\u2019s a large-scale feature rather than high-frequency noise). SHAP assigns strong positive weight to that low-frequency pulse and to the late terminal rise.\\n- Additional low-frequency features (not as strongly red in SHAP but visible in the signal & STFT): a deep broad trough near t\u224846\u201352 (amplitude about -2.0) and preceding/mid positive hump around t\u224830\u201338 (amplitude ~+1.4\u2013+1.5). These are low-volatility, broad lobes (STFT energy at very low freq). SHAP is less intense over some of these but overall the model\u2019s positive attribution pattern centers on the early broad descent (13\u201330) and the mid/late positive pulse (100\u2013130).\\n- Frequency-characterization summary: STFT confirms that the positively attributed regions correspond to energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins (very slow/large-scale components). Higher-frequency bands carry little power during these same windows, and where mid-frequency energy appears (e.g., during sharper transitions) SHAP is neutral or slightly negative.\\n\\nTask 2 \u2014 overall sample-level feature analysis (trend, periodicity, volatility, temporal dependence):\\n- Global trend & periodicity: The series is dominated by a low-frequency quasi-periodic envelope composed of several broad lobes across the 144 points: initial high positive at t=0, broad descent to an early trough (~t\u224818), large positive hump (~t\u224830\u201338), deep trough (~t\u224846\u201352), a mid region of small oscillations around zero (~t\u224856\u201390), a pronounced positive pulse (~t\u2248100\u2013108), a following trough (~t\u2248115), and then a strong terminal rise (t\u2248130\u2013143). This gives roughly 2\u20133 slow undulations across the sequence \u2014 characteristic of low fundamental frequency.\\n- Volatility: Low within the broad lobes (smooth ramps), higher only during the sharper transitions (e.g., the rapid rise around t\u2248100). Local small-amplitude higher-frequency wiggles occur in the 60\u201390 window but have low STFT energy and neutral SHAP; they are not primary drivers.\\n- Temporal dependence and combination: The model appears to integrate multiple separated low-frequency events additively. The early broad descent (13\u201330) and the mid/late positive pulse (100\u2013130) are the strongest positive contributors; intermediate troughs and mid-humps provide context and reinforce a multi-lobe contour signature. Timing (order) matters: the pattern early trough -> mid hump -> deep mid trough -> late positive pulse -> final rise forms the distinctive sequence-level signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 match to label patterns and initial label selection reasoning:\\n- Comparing to provided label summaries:\\n  * Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): summary highlights strong low-frequency negative swing early (t\u224810\u201326), a pronounced deep trough near t\u224848\u201354, a large positive pulse / rapid rise around t\u224892\u2013106, and a final sustained rise near the end. SHAP/plot for the test sample show essentially the same events in timing, polarity and frequency bands (early broad descent at ~13\u201330; deep trough near ~48\u201352; a strong positive pulse near 100\u2013108; final large rise). STFT and SHAP align with low-frequency emphasis. => High match.\\n  * Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): also describes early large downward swing and multiple low-frequency humps/troughs (early trough ~25\u201330, mid hump ~36\u201352, late trough ~104\u2013120, final rise). There is similarity, but the label_2 summary emphasizes a later large negative trough around 104\u2013120 whereas our sample shows a positive pulse around 100\u2013108 followed by a trough \u2014 the sign and timing of that mid/late event more closely match label_3\u2019s described positive pulse. => Moderate match.\\n  * Labels 0,1,4,5,6 (Mirage, Eurofighter, Harrier, F-22, F-15): all these labels in their summaries emphasize different mid-window timing/amplitude patterns (for example label_4 Harrier has a dominant mid positive hump centered ~52\u201371; label_1 Eurofighter focuses on mid 39\u201395 asymmetric cycle). While our sample has broad low-frequency energy, the exact ordering, the deep trough at ~48\u201352, and the strong late positive pulse align best with F-14 wings-open (label 3). => Low-to-moderate matches for others, but less compelling than label_3.\\n- Preliminary label choice: label 3 (F-14 wings opened), because the early strong low-frequency descent, deep trough near ~48\u201352, the strong late positive pulse centered ~100\u2013108, and the final sustained rise all map very closely to the label_3 feature description and to the provided similar-reference samples (which are all label 3).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 recheck with reference samples and finalize scores:\\n- The four most-similar reference plots (samples 46, 102, 17, 43) are all labeled 3 and visually match the test sample almost exactly: same initial high, monotonic early fall to trough, strong mid trough near t\u224848\u201352, small mid-region oscillations, strong positive pulse ~100\u2013108, and final rise to the same endpoint magnitude. Their STFTs show the same low-frequency concentration in the early and late windows; their SHAP heatmaps show strongly positive low-frequency attribution in the same time bands (bottom rows around the same columns). This strongly confirms label 3.\\n- The two dissimilar references (labels 4) emphasize a dominant mid positive hump around t\u224865\u201375 and a different STFT/SHAP pattern (higher low-frequency energy centralized at a different time window). Those do not match our key events (especially the late positive pulse timing and the deep trough at t\u224848\u201352), so they do not contradict the label 3 decision.\\n\\nSimilarity quantification (1\u20134) relative to each label (used to sanity-check scoring):\\n  - label 0 (Mirage): 2 (low similarity \u2014 both emphasize low-frequency lobes but timing/ordering differ; Mirage patterns emphasize mid windows at different positions and different sequence of lobes)\\n  - label 1 (Eurofighter): 2 (low similarity \u2014 Eurofighter centers discriminative evidence in a mid-window asymmetric cycle ~39\u201395; our sample\u2019s strongest evidence is early and a distinct late positive pulse)\\n  - label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 shares early decline and multiple low-frequency lobes, but the sign/timing of the late mid pulse/trough differs from the closed-wing summary)\\n  - label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 4 (high similarity \u2014 near-complete match: early low-frequency sweep, deep trough ~48\u201354, strong positive pulse ~92\u2013106, final rise; SHAP/STFT align and reference samples corroborate)\\n  - label 4 (Harrier): 1 (no similarity \u2014 Harrier expects a dominant mid hump centered earlier than our strongest positive-attribution windows)\\n  - label 5 (F-22): 2 (low similarity \u2014 F-22 focuses on a different mid hump shape and smaller-amplitude repeated lobes)\\n  - label 6 (F-15): 2 (low similarity \u2014 F-15 has persistent low-frequency envelope across middle with fewer abrupt large positive pulses in the same positions)\\n\\nFinal verification and conclusion:\\n- Cross-check against the four provided 'similar' references: they are all label 3 and nearly identical in waveform, STFT and SHAP location/intensity. The scoring and reasoning are consistent and fair \u2014 key features (timing, sign, amplitude of lobes, frequency content) match label_3 most strongly.\\n- Therefore the final classification is label 3 (F-14, wings opened) with a high similarity score (4 out of 4).\"\n  ]\n}",

Manifestation: very low volatility inside the descent (smooth monotonic fall), large net change (~\u22123.8 units over ~18 steps) giving an average slope \u2248 \u22120.20 to \u22120.22 units/step. STFT: energy concentrated in the bottom frequency bins in this interval, confirming this is a slow (low\u2011frequency) macro-shape. The model gives strong positive SHAP here, so the classifier treats this long, smooth negative lobe as a strong cue.\\n- Mid/early-mid deep trough block (SHAP red centered near time ~46\u201354): the plot shows a pronounced minimum around t\u224848\u201352 (value \u2248 \u22122.0). Manifestation: a wide, low-frequency trough (lasting ~8\u201312 steps), low internal volatility, and a clear low-frequency STFT signature. SHAP concentrates on the lowest-frequency rows at that time, indicating the model uses this deep broad trough as a distinctive feature.\\n- Late-mid positive pulse / rapid rise (SHAP red at low freq around t\u224892\u2013106): the trace rises rapidly from a deep negative value (\u2248 \u22121.8 near t\u224892) to a positive peak \u2248 +1.4 around t\u2248104\u2013106.

SHAP shows strong positive attribution in the lowest frequency rows during the ascent/peak, so the classifier treats this late positive pulse as supportive evidence.\\n- End-sequence broad rise (weaker red at low freq near t\u2248130\u2013143): the final segment climbs from slightly negative/moderate values up to a large positive endpoint (~+2.6 at t=143). This rise is broad and low-frequency (STFT low bins), lower SHAP intensity than the earlier blocks but still positive \u2014 a reinforcing terminal bulge.\\n- Non-diagnostic small wiggles: between ~60\u201385 the series contains higher-frequency, small-amplitude oscillations (amplitude \u2248 \u00b10.1\u20130.6).

This produces strong STFT energy concentrated at the lowest frequencies aligned with the large events and much weaker energy at higher frequencies.\\n- Volatility & change rates: volatility is low within the broad lobes (smooth ramps) and higher only during short transition windows (e.g., the ascent into the late pulse). Downward and upward slopes vary: the initial fall is fairly steep and sustained, the mid trough is wide and smooth, while the late rise is relatively fast compared with the earlier ramps.\\n- Temporal dependence: the classifier\u2019s SHAP attribution highlights multiple separated low-frequency events (early descent, mid trough, late positive pulse, end rise). These combine additively to support the decision \u2014 the ordering (early trough before mid trough, then late pulse then end rise) and timing of those broad contour features appears central to the model\u2019s decision-making.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature lists and initial label selection:\\n- Compare to provided summaries: Label 3 (F-14 wings opened) description explicitly lists (a) a large low-frequency early downward swing (t\u224810\u201326), (b) a pronounced deep trough centered near t\u224848\u201354, (c) small higher-frequency oscillations in a mid window (~60\u201385) with neutral SHAP, (d) a prominent positive peak / rapid rise around t\u224892\u2013106, and (e) a final sustained rise near the end. The current sample shows these same features with nearly identical timing, amplitude ranges, volatility patterns and STFT/SHAP signatures.\\n- All other label summaries emphasize somewhat different canonical signatures (for example: label 2 emphasizes trough\u2013hump\u2013trough repeating pattern at particular positions but the specific combination of early descent + mid deep trough + late rapid rise + end bulge aligns closest to label 3).

Dissimilar examples (labels 4) show central high positive humps at different time positions and different SHAP distributions.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final scoring justification:\\n- Visual and spectral cross-check: the four similar reference samples (samples 46, 102, 17, 43) all show the same set of features (early high \u2192 down into broad trough around t\u224818\u201325, deep trough near t\u224848\u201352, small mid wiggles, late strong rise/pulse around t\u2248104\u2013110, final rise to large endpoint). Their STFTs also concentrate energy in the lowest frequency rows at the same time windows and their SHAP maps show strong low-frequency red blocks at the matching columns. This confirms the model consistently learned and uses this multi-block low-frequency motif for label 3.\\n- Dissimilar examples (labels 4) display a different principal discriminant (a dominant mid-segment large positive hump around t\u224852\u201371) and their SHAP maps emphasize different time/frequency blocks; those do not match the test sample\u2019s dominant early trough + mid trough + late pulse arrangement.\\n- Given the almost one-to-one correspondence with the label-3 descriptive pattern and multiple near-identical reference instances, I assign the highest similarity rating (4 = high similarity) for label 3.\\n\\nFinal conclusion: The test sample\u2019s time-domain shape, STFT low-frequency concentration, and SHAP low-frequency positive attribution at the early-trough, mid-trough and late-rise windows strongly match the documented label_3 (F-14 wings opened) pattern and the provided label-3 reference samples.

A weaker low-frequency positive region also appears near the sequence end (t \u2248 130\u2013143). Mapping those windows to the raw series yields the following precise, unambiguous local features: (a) Early window t\u224813\u201326: the signal falls from a large positive start (~+2.5 at t\u22480, entering the window near ~+0.3\u2013+1.0) down to a deep trough around t\u224818\u201322 with amplitude \u2248 -1.5 to -1.9.

STFT shows most signal energy concentrated in the lowest frequency band at the same time locations SHAP highlights (start window, mid-late pulse, end) \u2014 indicating the classifier relies on slow, large-scale contour components and their temporal order.

These red blocks are at the bottom frequency rows (very low frequency). STFT confirms elevated low-frequency energy co-located with those time windows (bright band at the bottom rows at the same columns).\\n- Corresponding time-series manifestations and fine-grained description:\\n  * Window A (\u2248t=13\u201339): amplitude & trend \u2014 the trace starts high (~+2.6 at t=0) and by t\u224813\u201320 it has fallen toward ~0 then continues down to a local trough near t\u224818\u201322 (~-1.4 to -1.5), followed by a smooth, large-amplitude upward swing peaking around t\u224834\u201336 at ~+1.5. Change rate & shape \u2014 the descent from the start to the trough is relatively steep (average negative slope large in magnitude early), the recovery into the mid positive peak is smooth and low-volatility (broad, low-frequency hump). Volatility & substructure \u2014 within this window small high-frequency wiggles are minor; the event is dominated by low-frequency curvature (broad trough\u2192rise). STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest bins, consistent with a long-wavelength contour.\\n  * Window B (\u2248t=104\u2013117): amplitude & trend \u2014 there is a pronounced large low-frequency positive pulse earlier (a rapid large ascent from a deep negative value to ~+1.3 around t\u2248104\u2013108) and then a fall into a negative region by t\u2248118\u2013122 (drop to \u2248-1.1 to -1.3). Change rate & shape \u2014 the rise into the positive pulse is relatively fast (high slope compared with the smooth humps), but the overall event still contains substantial low-frequency energy; SHAP attributes positive weight to the low-frequency rows during the rising/peak portion. Volatility & substructure \u2014 the ascent is the primary low-frequency pulse; some higher-frequency detail appears at the descent, but this carries weaker or negative attribution in mid-frequency rows (visible in SHAP as slight blue there). STFT again shows low-frequency energy aligned with the positive pulse.\\n- Additional local events: a deep trough appears near t\u224846\u201352 (~-2.0), and a small positive hump around t\u224852\u201365 (0.4\u20130.6) and a trough near t\u224890\u201395 (~-1.8). These are mostly low-frequency broad excursions except some sharper descents (e.g., trough near 48) that introduce modest mid-frequency energy and reduced SHAP contribution at those mid-frequencies.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall sample characterization (trends, periodicity, volatility, temporal dependence):\\n- Global trend & envelope: the series is quasi-oscillatory with several broad low-frequency lobes across 144 steps: initial high value (t=0), a steep early descent to a trough (~t=18\u201325), a smooth broad recovery and peak (~t=34), a deep mid trough (~t=48), a cluster of small mid-level oscillations around t\u224852\u201390, a pronounced late-mid positive pulse (~t=92\u2013108), a subsequent dip (~t=118\u2013125) and a final strong rising edge to the end (t=143 \u2248 +2.6). The energy and SHAP are concentrated on slow, large-scale components (low-frequency rows) rather than sustained high-frequency content.\\n- Periodicity & temporal dependence: behaviour resembles a few slow cycles (broad trough\u2192peak\u2192trough\u2192peak), with typical spacing between major extrema on the order of 20\u201340 steps. The classifier's SHAP map indicates it uses the timing and order of these large low-frequency lobes (presence of troughs and supporting positive bulges at specific positions) rather than local spikes. The major low-frequency positive attributions align with the mid-recovery (t\u224813\u201339 region) and the late positive pulse (t\u2248104\u2013117), so the model weights those features additively.\\n- Volatility: volatility is heterogeneous \u2014 low inside broad ramps and peaks (smooth), higher during certain descents (notably near the deep trough at ~48 and the descent after the late pulse). STFT shows modest mid-frequency content at sharper transitions, which SHAP sometimes penalizes (blue) while rewarding broad low-frequency content (red).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare with label feature summaries and assign similarity scores:\\nI compared the test-sample manifestations to the provided per-label feature summaries. Per-label similarity (1\u20134):\\n- label 0 (Mirage) \u2014 score 2 (low): Mirage examples emphasize sustained low-frequency rises in the middle window (t\u224826\u201365) and multiple smooth lobes in a particular configuration. Some elements (low-frequency energy) are shared, but the test sample\u2019s deep trough at ~48 and the strong late positive pulse match Mirage only weakly.\\n- label 1 (Eurofighter) \u2014 score 2 (low): Eurofighter emphasizes a dominant asymmetric mid-cycle hump (rise then fast fall near t\u224839\u201395). The test sample has multiple lobes and a trough near t\u224848 rather than the Eurofighter\u2019s characteristic small hump followed by a larger hump; similarity is limited.\\n- label 2 (F-14 wings closed) \u2014 score 3 (moderate): label_2 descriptions include an early steep drop into a wide trough (t\u22480\u201335), subsequent mid modest hump, and a pronounced late trough then recovery to a large positive endpoint. The test sample shares the early steep decline and multiple troughs / later recovery pattern, so there is moderate overlap though specific timings and signs differ somewhat.\\n- label 3 (F-14 wings opened) \u2014 score 4 (high): label_3 summary explicitly describes (1) a strong low-frequency negative swing early (t\u224810\u201326), (2) a deep trough around t\u224848\u201354, (3) small higher-frequency oscillations mid-sequence (t\u224860\u201385), and (4) a pronounced positive pulse / rapid rise around t\u224892\u2013106 and a late sustained rise. The test sample matches these features very closely: early descent to trough, deep trough ~48, small mid oscillations, strong rise ~92\u2013106, and a late end rise. SHAP attribution also aligns (low-frequency positive attribution at the early-mid and late-mid windows). This produces a best match with label 3.\\n- label 4 (Harrier) \u2014 score 1 (no similarity): Harrier's defining feature is a single large mid-segment positive hump (\u2248t=52\u201371) with a clear trough\u2192big rise signature. The test sample lacks that dominant single mid hump; the shape and timing differ substantially, so little similarity.\\n- label 5 (F-22) \u2014 score 2 (low): F-22 summary expects a dominant positive hump around t\u224836\u201370 with supporting lobes later; the test sample instead has a pronounced negative trough ~48 and multiple separated lobes; low match.\\n- label 6 (F-15) \u2014 score 2 (low): F-15 descriptions emphasize a persistent low-frequency envelope with twin peaks around mid times and penalty for sharp mid-frequency transitions. The test sample has certain long-scale components in common, but the exact envelope (peak spacing and magnitudes) and the clear trough at ~48 distinguish it from F-15 prototypes.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and finalize:\\n- The four 'most similar' training references provided are all labeled 3 and their plots/STFT/SHAP maps are visually near-identical to the test sample (same early high\u2192steep decline\u2192mid trough near 48\u2192small mid wiggles\u2192late sharp positive pulse\u2192final rise). Their SHAP maps also concentrate positive mass at the same bottom-frequency/time windows (\u224813\u201339 and \u2248104\u2013117). This strong agreement with multiple labeled-3 references corroborates the label-3 decision and the high similarity score.\\n- The two dissimilar references (label 4) show a dominant mid positive hump and different STFT low-frequency timing; they do not match the test sample, confirming the low similarity assigned to label 4.\\n- Scoring fairness & consistency: per-label scores (above) were assigned by matching the test sample\u2019s concrete time-location, amplitude and shape of low-frequency lobes and transitions to the textual prototypes. Because the test series replicates the exact key features listed under label_3 (and matches the reference examples visually), label_3 is the correct best match and is given the highest similarity (4). label_2 is the next-most-similar (3) because of shared early trough + final recovery structure but differs in the precise mid-lobe arrangements.\\n\\nFinal statement: The test sample is classified as label 3 (F-14 wings opened). The match is high (score 4) because the sample contains the early strong low-frequency descent, the deep mid trough near t\u224848, the small mid-frequency wiggles, and the late strong positive pulse (t\u224892\u2013108) that together are the hallmark features described for label 3 and are present in multiple labeled-3 references.\"\n  ]\n}",
      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 3\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local (red/positive SHAP) feature description (fine-grained):\\n- SHAP highlights (deepest red) are concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows in two main time blocks: an early block roughly t \u2248 10\u201330 (most intense around 13\u201326) and a late/mid\u2011late block roughly t \u2248 100\u2013130 (most intense ~104\u2013130). There is also modest positive activity in the lowest-frequency band in the mid region (\u224850\u201370) but much weaker than the primary two blocks.\\n- Corresponding time-series segment (early block, \u224810\u201330): amplitude & trend: the series falls from a high positive value at t=0 (~+2.6) through ~0 around t\u224812 and into a broad negative trough centered near t\u224818\u201322 with amplitude about \u22121.4 to \u22121.6. Change rate & shape: this is a relatively sustained, smooth, monotonic descent (average slope across the fall \u2248 \u22120.15 to \u22120.22 units/step), low local volatility (few small wiggles inside the descent/trough). STFT confirmation: the STFT shows concentrated energy at the lowest frequency rows during this same window, consistent with a long-wavelength (low-frequency) downward lobe. Interpretation: the model positively attributes this large-scale slow descent and wide trough (a broad concavity) to the predicted class.\\n- Corresponding time-series segment (mid/secondary block, \u224836\u201352): the signal rises from the early trough to a fairly large positive hump (peak ~+1.4\u2013+1.6 around t\u224832\u201336) then returns to a deep negative trough centered ~t\u224848\u201352 (min \u2248 \u22122.0). This two\u2011part hump\u2192deep trough is dominated by low-frequency energy (STFT bottom rows) and the SHAP map shows low-frequency positive attribution over parts of the ascent/peak and the trough-leading flank. Volatility is low during the hump and trough (smooth curvature); the descent into the deep trough centered ~48\u201352 is somewhat steeper (higher instantaneous slope) than the preceding rise.\\n- Corresponding time-series segment (late/mid\u2011late block, \u224892\u2013114 and \u2248104\u2013130): there is a strong, fast positive swing between roughly t\u224892\u2013106 rising from a deep negative (\u2248 \u22121.8) to a prominent peak \u2248 +1.3\u2013+1.4 around t\u2248104\u2013110; afterwards the signal descends to another negative valley near t\u2248115\u2013125 before the final strong rise to the endpoint (~+2.6 at t=143). SHAP shows concentrated low-frequency positive attribution on the large positive rise/peak region (\u2248104\u2013130), and STFT again shows low-frequency dominance there. Change rate & volatility: the rise into the positive pulse is relatively quick (large slope over ~10\u201314 steps) but still contains predominantly low-frequency power (i.e. it is a large-scale pulse rather than high-frequency jitter).\\n- Small-scale/high-frequency behavior: between the major lobes (roughly t\u224856\u201390) the series shows small oscillations (amplitude ~\u00b10.2\u20130.6). STFT indicates little energy at mid/high frequencies and SHAP there is neutral-to-slight (mixed colors). These micro\u2011wiggles have minimal positive attribution and are not the decisive features.\\n- Summary of local feature mapping: The model is positively weighting broad, low-frequency lobes (early large descent to trough, mid deep trough preceded by a hump, late positive pulse and final rise). These events are smooth (low volatility inside lobes), carry most energy in the lowest STFT rows, and align with the strong red SHAP regions reported above.\"\n    ,\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Global / overall series features and temporal dependence:\\n- Global pattern: The series is dominated by a sequence of a few large, slow undulations (low-frequency cycles) across the 144 points: (1) a large early descent from a high positive start into a broad trough (t\u224810\u201330), (2) recovery into a mid positive hump then a deep mid trough (t\u224830\u201352), (3) a relatively quiescent mid-section with small oscillations (t\u224856\u201392), (4) a strong late-mid positive pulse (t\u224892\u2013110) followed by a descent and a final broad rise to the end (t\u2248125\u2013143). This is a quasi\u2011periodic low-frequency envelope with 2\u20133 main lobes.\\n- Frequency / volatility: STFT and the time-domain curves confirm energy concentrated at the lowest frequencies whenever the major lobes occur; volatility inside those lobes is low (smooth ramps), whereas steeper transitions between lobes produce modestly higher local spectral content but are still dominated by low-frequency power. Small high-frequency jitter exists in mid\u2011sections but carries little attribution.\\n- Temporal dependence & ordering: The discriminative information is in the ordering and timing of these broad lobes (early trough, mid deep trough, late large positive pulse, terminal rise). The classifier\u2019s SHAP map places positive weight where broad low-frequency bulges appear; multiple separated positive/negative lobes additively strengthen the prediction. In short: the model leverages the sequence of large-scale curvature events (phase/relative timing, amplitude asymmetry and slow-vs\u2011fast transition characteristics) rather than isolated spikes.\"\n    ,\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Compare to provided label feature sets and choose best match:\\n- Quick match to label descriptions: The sample\u2019s dominant characteristics (early large smooth descent into a trough around t\u224810\u201330; a pronounced deep trough near t\u224848\u201352; a strong late-mid positive pulse around t\u224892\u2013110; final broad rise to endpoint) map closely to the feature summary under label_3 (F-14 wings opened). Label_3\u2019s summary explicitly mentions the early low-frequency negative swing near t=10\u201326, a deep trough near t\u224848\u201354, a pronounced upward swing near t\u224892\u2013106 and a final sustained increase; SHAP bottom-row attribution in label_3 examples aligns with the test sample\u2019s SHAP pattern.\\n- Contrast with other labels:\\n  * label_0 (Mirage): emphasizes repeated slow rises and mid-window slow rise (26\u201365) and multiple broad peaks; test sample has a large mid trough and a distinct early trough\u2014less consistent.\\n  * label_1 (Eurofighter): stresses a dominant mid-window asymmetric cycle centered ~39\u201395 and downplays final rise. The test sample has both early trough and later pulses; the mid-cycle in label_1 is different in shape (two-hump slow oscillation) and label_1 SHAP emphasis is centered differently.\\n  * label_2 (F-14 wings closed): also low-frequency multi-hump pattern but label_2 has early steep fall and multiple humps at specific windows (\\u223c13\u201326, 78\u201391, 104\u2013130). There is partial overlap but the particular sequence of deep mid trough + late positive pulse matches label_3 more closely (and the reference examples reinforce this).\\n  * label_4 (Harrier): main discriminative feature is a dominant single mid positive hump (~52\u201371) not present as the dominant morphological element here (this test sample\u2019s largest positive hump occurs later around 104\u2013110 and the mid hump is followed by a deep trough, which contradicts label_4\u2019s main signature).\\n  * label_5 (F-22): primary mid hump around 36\u201370 and strong endpoint amplitudes; test sample has some similarities but also has the deep mid trough that is more typical of label_3.\\n  * label_6 (F-15): characterized by wide smooth envelope across middle region and penalizes sharp mid-frequency transitions; test sample has some sharp transitions (mid deep trough) that label_6 would penalize.\\n- Based on shape, timing and SHAP alignment, label_3 is the best match.\\n- Assign per-label similarity (1\u20134) as requested (justification brief):\\n  * label 0: 2 (low similarity \u2014 both emphasize low-frequency features but the timing and shapes differ: test has deep mid trough & late pulse not matching label_0\u2019s mid slow rise emphasis)\\n  * label 1: 2 (low similarity \u2014 test lacks the particular ordered two-hump mid-cycle that label_1 stresses)\\n  * label 2: 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 both are low-frequency multi\u2011lobe patterns and share early troughs and late troughs, but the precise timing/ordering and relative hump sizes match label_3 better)\\n  * label 3: 4 (high similarity \u2014 early trough at ~10\u201326, deep trough ~48\u201354, late positive pulse ~92\u2013106 and final rise all match the label_3 pattern and the SHAP/time\u2011frequency signature)\\n  * label 4: 1 (no similarity \u2014 label_4 expects a dominant mid positive hump centered ~52\u201371; the test sample\u2019s dominant mid element is a deep trough around ~48\u201352 followed by a later pulse)\\n  * label 5: 2 (low similarity \u2014 there is some overlap (endpoints large, mid positive lobe) but test sample has a deeper mid trough and an ordering of lobes more like label_3)\\n  * label 6: 2 (low similarity \u2014 both emphasize low-frequency envelope, but label_6 penalizes the sharper mid transitions present here)\\n- From the above, label_3 wins clearly; I therefore output label 3 with a high confidence/similarity score of 4.\"\n  ]\n}",

Corresponding raw trace behavior: the series begins high (~+2.6 at t=0) and shows a smooth, mostly monotonic descent through this interval down to a local trough near t\u224818 (amplitude \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6). Change rate here is large and negative (roughly -0.18 to -0.25 units/step across the major fall), volatility is low inside the descent (no high-frequency jitter), and STFT confirms energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins during this interval. Shape: broad, slow downward curvature (a wide low-frequency valley). This low-frequency descending lobe is the first major discriminative feature.\\n- Secondary positively attributed window B: a strong red block at the lowest frequencies around time steps ~104\u2013130. On the trace this aligns with a large, rapid upward pulse around t\u224892\u2013106 (the signal climbs from a deep negative value \u2248 -1.8 near t\u224892 up to a peak \u2248 +1.3\u20131.4 by t\u2248104\u2013110) and then a descent into a modest valley around t\u2248118, followed by a final smooth rise to the end (t\u2248130\u2013143) with endpoint \u2248 +2.6. The upward pulse (\u2248+3.0 change over ~12\u201314 steps; avg slope \u2248 +0.20\u2013+0.25) is strongly low-frequency in STFT and receives strong positive SHAP attribution. Volatility across this block is low for the main swing but the rise is relatively fast compared with earlier slow descent.\\n- Tertiary features (less strongly red/neutral): moderate low-frequency energy and small positive attribution appear around the mid-sequence humps (t\u224834\u201356 and t\u224856\u201385) but these carry lower SHAP intensity. There are brief higher-frequency small oscillations between t\u224860\u201385; STFT shows some mid-frequency content there and SHAP is neutral-to-slightly negative in mid-frequency rows\u2014i.e., the classifier discounts sharper jitter.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and dependence:\\n- The sample is dominated by large, slow (very low-frequency) lobes: an early large descent into a trough (t\u224810\u201326), a mid-stage pair of smaller hump/trough events (t\u224834\u201385) with low volatility, and a late large negative-to-positive pulse and recovery (t\u224892\u2013130) culminating in a strong end-of-sequence rise (t\u2248130\u2013143).\\n- Periodicity / envelope: quasi-periodic low-frequency cycles with roughly 20\u201350 step spacing between extrema (broad trough/peak/trough/peak). Most spectral energy relevant to classification is concentrated at the lowest STFT bins (confirmed by the STFT image matching the SHAP red locations).\\n- Volatility: low within broad ramps; occasional localized faster transitions (notably the late-rise around t\u224892\u2013106) and small high-frequency oscillations mid-sequence. The classifier prefers the smooth low-frequency envelope (positive SHAP) and penalizes mid-frequency sharpness (blue/neutral SHAP in mid bands).\\n- Temporal dependence: discriminative evidence is not a single isolated event but the ordered combination: early broad descent (t\u224813\u201326) -> mid humps and troughs -> late large upward pulse and end rise. The timing and sign of these broad lobes (their sequence) is critical to the model.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and selection:\\n- Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): The label_3 description explicitly lists (i) a strong low-frequency negative swing around t\u224810\u201326, (ii) a pronounced deep trough near t\u224848, (iii) a relatively quiet mid-window with small fast oscillations, and (iv) a prominent positive large pulse / rapid rise around t\u224892\u2013106 and a final sustained rise toward the end. This sequence and the frequency/SHAP pattern align very closely with the test sample (both in amplitude, time ranges, slopes and low-frequency dominance). Therefore the match to label 3 is high. Score: 4 (high similarity).\\n- Label 5 (F-22): label_5 expects a dominant mid-sequence positive hump centered roughly t\u224836\u201370 and supporting lobes later; it also remarks on large endpoint amplitudes. Our sample does have mid-sequence lobes and large endpoints, but the classifier's strongest SHAP is on the early descent and the late positive pulse rather than a single dominant mid hump at t\u224836\u201370. So similarity is moderate-to-low. Score: 2.\\n- Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): label_2 features multiple low-frequency events (early fall, trough ~25\u201330, mid/late humps, and late trough at ~104\u2013120 followed by final rise). There is some overlap with our sample (early fall and multi-lobed structure), but the key distinguishing sign/ordering differs (label_2 emphasizes a late trough ~104\u2013120 as decisive, while our sample shows a late positive pulse earlier ~92\u2013106). Thus similarity is modest but lower than label 3. Score: 2.\\n- Labels 0, 1, 4, 6 (Mirage, Eurofighter, Harrier, F-15): their summaries emphasize other timing/amplitude signatures (e.g., label_0 and label_1 concentrate positive low-frequency mid-windows at times that don't match the early-large-descent + late-rapid-rise ordering here; label_4 expects one strong mid bump centered \u224852\u201371; label_6 emphasizes persistent low-frequency envelope but penalizes mid-frequency bursts). Overall these do not align as well as label 3. Scores: label_0=1, label_1=1, label_4=1, label_6=1.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference samples:\\n- The four 'similar' reference examples provided are all labeled 3 in the reference set (samples 46, 102, 14, 67). Visual inspection: their raw traces, STFT patterns and SHAP heatmaps are essentially isomorphic to the test sample (same early descent into trough around t\u224810\u201326, same deep trough near t\u224848, similar mid small oscillations, and the strong positive attribution at the lowest-frequency rows around t\u2248104\u2013130). This empirical match to multiple training examples strongly confirms the decision.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' references (labels 4.0) show different mid-window dominant positive hump locations and STFT energy distributions; they do not share the distinct early trough + late strong pulse ordering found in the test sample, reinforcing that label 4 is not a good fit.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification:\\n- Based on: (a) exact alignment of the SHAP-positive low-frequency time windows (t\u224813\u201326 and t\u2248104\u2013130) with large, smooth troughs and pulses in the raw trace; (b) STFT agreement showing low-frequency energy in those same windows; (c) the label_3 feature summary describing precisely these events and ordering; and (d) multiple reference samples labeled 3 that are visually and spectrally almost identical \u2014 the correct classification is label 3 (F-14 wings opened).\\n- Reported similarity scores (for transparency): label_0=1, label_1=1, label_2=2, label_3=4, label_4=1, label_5=2, label_6=1. The provided overall score field reports the similarity for the predicted label (label 3) as 4.\"\n    ]\n}"

STFT energy is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins at the early and late-mid windows; the SHAP heatmap places strongest positive attribution at those same low-frequency/time blocks (bottom rows, ~13\u201330 and ~104\u2013130). High-frequency jitter between ~60\u201385 is weak in STFT and neutral/negative in SHAP.

This trough supplements the early descent to form a multi-lobe low-frequency signature.\",\n    \"3) Mid-late positive pulse (approx. time steps ~100\u2013115): SHAP displays a second strong positive attribution concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows around roughly t\u2248104\u2013120. In the time series this corresponds to a rapid large positive movement from a negative region up to a local peak (the trace climbs by \u2248 +2.8\u20133.2 units across ~12\u201320 steps in that window). Manifestation: large amplitude, relatively fast upward slope for the event (average slope here is larger than earlier rises), but the STFT still shows the event\u2019s energy concentrated in the bottom frequency band (broad pulse rather than narrow spike). The SHAP red here indicates this event is also strongly used by the classifier.\",\n    \"4) Final terminal rise (approx. time steps ~130\u2013143): SHAP shows modest positive low-frequency attribution at the very end. In the raw series the end rises smoothly to a high endpoint (~+2.4 to +2.6). Manifestation: broad low-frequency final bulge with low volatility. STFT: low-frequency power reappears at the edges. This terminal bulge provides additional supporting evidence, though its SHAP intensity is weaker than the earlier two main blocks.\",\n    \"5) High-frequency / mid-frequency content: Across the entire SHAP map the mid/higher frequency rows are mostly neutral or slightly negative in places (blue/white). The STFT shows only weak energy in those bands except in brief transitions; where mid-frequency energy appears it tends to align with neutral/negative SHAP and corresponds to faster transitions (which the classifier penalizes).\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and feature relationships:\",\n    \"1) Dominant structure: The series is dominated by several large, smooth low-frequency lobes (early high \u2192 long descent to trough, a deep mid trough, a mid-late strong upward pulse, and a final rise). The STFT and SHAP agree that most discriminative energy is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins. This yields a quasi-periodic, multi-lobe global envelope rather than rapid oscillations.\",\n    \"2) Volatility: Low volatility (smooth ramps) within the broad lobes; occasional localized faster transitions (notably the ascent around t\u2248100\u2013115 and descent into earlier troughs) produce modest mid-frequency energy but those faster components are not given positive SHAP weight\u2014indeed they tend to be neutral or slightly negative in SHAP. That indicates the classifier prefers smooth long-wavelength features and downweights sharp local edges.\",\n    \"3) Asymmetry & change rates: The profile shows asymmetric ramps \u2014 the initial decline is relatively fast and smooth, subsequent rises are often slower except the mid-late upswing which is comparatively faster. The ordering (large early descent and trough \u2192 recovery \u2192 another trough \u2192 strong mid-late rise \u2192 final broad rise) is consistent and temporally structured; the classifier appears to use this ordering of broad lobes as a signature.\",\n    \"4) Temporal dependence / combination: The model\u2019s SHAP attribution is additive across the separate low-frequency blocks \u2014 multiple separated low-frequency lobes (especially the early descent/trough and the mid-late positive pulse) together produce a strong positive classification signal. The presence, amplitude and timing of these lobes are jointly important rather than any single isolated spike.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching to label summaries and initial label selection:\",\n    \"I compared the extracted local and global features to the per-label feature descriptions included in the background. The test sample\u2019s salient properties (dominant low-frequency energy, early large positive baseline followed by a broad early descent to a trough, multiple separated low-frequency lobes, a pronounced mid-late positive pulse, low local volatility in lobes, and SHAP positive weight concentrated in very-low-frequency rows at early and mid-late time windows) match the Label 3 (F-14 wings opened) description closely. Key matches with label 3: multiple separated low-frequency negative deflections (broad troughs) and subsequent large low-frequency rises, SHAP concentrated in lowest-frequency rows at those times, and additive reinforcement of separated lobes \u2014 all described explicitly for label 3 in the provided summaries. The four nearest reference samples (Samples 17, 43, 102, 67) are labelled 3 and are visually and spectrally almost identical to the test sample (same lobes at same positions, same STFT concentration at bottom rows and similar SHAP blocks).\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided similar and dissimilar references and scoring logic:\",\n    \"1) Similar references (samples 17, 43, 102, 67; all label 3) \u2014 direct comparison: their waveforms overlay closely on the test sample: same early high start, descent to trough around t\u224818\u201352, middle small oscillations near 60\u201390, a large positive pulse in the 100\u2013115 window and a final rise to the end. Their STFTs show concentrated low-frequency energy in the same time windows and their SHAP heatmaps show the very-low-frequency red blocks in the exact same columns (early and ~104\u2013130). This near one-to-one correspondence confirms the classifier will reliably map this test sample to label 3. Given this, the similarity to label 3 is High \u2014 score 4.\",\n    \"2) Dissimilar references (samples 62 & 85; both label 4) \u2014 comparison: label-4 examples emphasize a dominant mid-sequence central positive hump (around t\u224852\u201370) as their primary discriminative feature, with SHAP red concentrated in that mid window at low frequencies. The test sample does not have such a dominant mid-centered hump; it instead has its largest discriminative low-frequency blocks earlier (~10\u201330) and mid-late (~104\u2013120). STFT patterns for labels 4 show stronger low-frequency energy centered in the middle portion; the test sample\u2019s STFT energy is concentrated in early and late windows. Thus the test sample is not consistent with the label-4 prototypical pattern (score would be low for label 4).\",\n    \"3) Other labels (0,1,2,5,6) \u2014 quick cross-check: those labels also emphasize low-frequency content in different temporal windows or specific asymmetries (e.g., label 0/1 focus on mid-segment bulges, label 2 on a particular set of troughs at specific windows, label 5 on mid positive lobes but with different amplitude/timing, label 6 on persistent low-frequency envelope but with different mid-frequency detractors). The test sample\u2019s precise combination and timing of early descent + deep mid trough + strong mid-late pulse + terminal rise aligns most closely with label 3\u2019s documented pattern.\",\n    \"Similarity quantification rationale (final): Taking into account the exact time positions of red SHAP blocks, STFT concentration at the lowest frequencies in those same windows, the waveform substructure (amplitude, shape, slopes, volatility), and the very close match with four training references all labelled 3, I assign the predicted label as label 3 (F-14 wings opened) with high confidence.

STFT: energy concentrated in the bottom frequency bins during this interval, confirming the event is a slow/large-scale component rather than high-frequency noise. Interpretation: a long-wavelength negative lobe (wide concavity) that the model treats as strong supporting evidence.\",\n    \"  - Secondary red region B (lowest-frequency rows, centered ~t = 48\u201354): SHAP shows positive attribution at the very low frequencies again near the first deep mid-sequence trough. On the time series the signal reaches a deep minimum around t\u224848\u201352 (amplitude \u2248 -2.0 to -2.1). Manifestation: a broad, sustained trough (width \u2248 6\u201312 steps) with low volatility inside. STFT: concentrated low-frequency magnitude at this time. Interpretation: this large negative lobe is another strong class-supporting feature (large-scale contour indentation).\",\n    \"  - Tertiary red region C (lowest-frequency rows, roughly t = 92\u2013110): SHAP highlights a later low-frequency positive pulse (strong red in bottom rows around the 104 tick area).

STFT confirms that most of the discriminative energy sits in the lowest frequency bins, meaning the classifier relies on coarse contour features (broad curvature) rather than fine texture.\",\n    \"  - Volatility & change rates: Volatility is low inside the broad lobes; the steepest instantaneous slopes appear during the early drop (\u2248 -0.2 units/step), the mid-late rise (\u2248 +0.18\u2013+0.25), and the terminal climb. Shorter, small-amplitude oscillations (\u00b10.2\u20130.5) appear in the 55\u201385 window but carry little positive SHAP weight.\",\n    \"  - Temporal dependence & combination: The classifier's positive attributions occur at consistent, separated time windows (early descent, deep mid trough, large late rise). These low-frequency events combine additively (multiple positive SHAP blocks) to form the class evidence rather than a single isolated spike; the order (early trough \u2192 mid trough \u2192 late rise) is consistent with a learned temporal signature.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match against label feature summaries (raw matching and preliminary scoring):\",\n    \"  - Label 3 (F-14, wings opened): Feature summary describes strong low-frequency early downward swing around t\u224810\u201326, a deep trough near t\u224848\u201354, mid sequence small wiggles, a pronounced positive pulse ~t\u224892\u2013106, and final sustained rise.

The SHAP narrative for label 3 indicates strong low-frequency positive attribution in the same early and t\u224892\u2013106 windows. The test sample contains all these features with very close timing, amplitude and STFT/SHAP alignment.

There is some overlap: the early fall and late trough/recovery + final rise appear in our sample. However label-2 emphasizes a trough earlier (t\u224825\u201330) and somewhat different mid-window hump timing; also the distinctive deep trough at t\u224848\u201352 and the strong positive pulse at t\u224892\u2013106 match label-3 more closely. So label 2 is similar but not the best match.\\n  -> Similarity: 3 (moderate)\\n\\n- Label 0 (Mirage): description emphasizes strong low-frequency positive attribution in a mid-window roughly t\u224826\u201365 (a slow rise from trough at ~25 to peaks around 50\u201375), and final broad rises; model favors smooth upward mid windows. Our sample has a deep negative trough at ~50 rather than a sustained mid-window smooth rise; though it shares the final endpoint rise and low-frequency dominance, the mid-window sign/pattern differs. Partial match but weaker.\\n  -> Similarity: 2 (low)\\n\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): description focuses on a dominant mid-segment slow asymmetric cycle (rise to a large positive bulge around t\u224872 then fast fall) and less emphasis on an early descent. Our sample lacks that large mid positive hump (it has a deep trough instead) so mismatch.\\n  -> Similarity: 1 (no/very low)\\n\\n- Label 4 (Harrier): key discriminative event is a large mid-segment positive hump (t\u224852\u201371 peak \u2248+2.6). Our sample does not show that positive mid hump (instead shows a deep negative trough there). So mismatch.\\n  -> Similarity: 1 (no)\\n\\n- Label 5 (F-22) and Label 6 (F-15): both emphasize positive mid-humps or twin peaks at mid times near t\u224836\u201370; our sample shows negative troughs there, so both are poor matches.\\n  -> Similarity: 1 for each (no)\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 cross-check with provided reference samples and SHAP patterns (verification):\\n\\n- The four highly similar reference samples shown are all labelled 3.0; their traces, STFTs and SHAP heatmaps are visually almost identical to the test sample: same early high -> descent, same deep trough at t\u224848\u201352, same cluster of low-amplitude mid oscillations, strong positive low-frequency SHAP mass at early and near t\u2248104, and a terminal rise. The SHAP patterns of those reference label-3 examples show the same concentrated red in the lowest-frequency rows at the early and t\u2248104 columns as we see for sample 32. This strongly supports the label-3 assignment.\\n\\n- The two dissimilar samples (label 4) emphasize a large mid positive hump (STFT & SHAP concentrated in the mid window low frequencies) and their SHAP maps show strongest red in a different time window; they differ visually from the test sample where that mid positive hump is absent and replaced by a deep negative trough. This rules out label 4.\\n\\n- Consistency check: the label-3 textual summary explicitly lists the early large downward deflection, the deep trough near t\u224848\u201354, the positive pulse around t\u224892\u2013106, and the final rise \u2014 all of which match sample 32 in amplitude, time range, shape (broad low-frequency lobes), and SHAP attribution. The STFT alignment (energy concentrated at lowest-frequency rows during those windows) also matches the label-3 description and the reference examples. Therefore the scoring of 4 for label 3 is justified.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification:\\n- Based on the detailed mapping of SHAP red blocks to specific trace features (early broad descent, deep trough at ~50, broad upward pulse at ~100\u2013106, final rise), the STFT low-frequency energy in the same windows, and the near one-to-one match with multiple reference samples labelled 3 (F-14 wings opened), the most accurate classification is label 3 (F-14 wings opened).

      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label_3\"],\n  \"score\": 4,\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local (red-SHAP) feature interpretation: I first located the strong red regions in the SHAP heatmap: they are concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows (near 0 Hz) around the early-mid window (~t \u2248 13\u201326) and again in a late-mid window (~t \u2248 100\u2013116). Using those time windows on the raw trace and the STFT, I read the fine-grained waveform details: (a) Early window (~t = 0 \u2192 26, strongest attribution \u224813\u201326): the series begins very high (~+2.5 to +2.6 at t=0), declines through ~t=10 to near zero and continues down to a broad trough around t\u224818\u201322 with amplitude about \u22121.4 to \u22121.6. The descent is smooth (low volatility) and relatively steep over the interval (average slope roughly \u22120.15 to \u22120.22 units/step across the initial drop). STFT shows most energy for this event in the bottom frequency row; SHAP positive mass is concentrated in those lowest-frequency rows, indicating the classifier is using this broad, low-frequency downward lobe as positive evidence. (b) Mid window (~t \u2248 46\u201354): although slightly less red, the trace contains a pronounced broad negative trough near t\u224848\u201352 (amplitude \u2248 \u22121.8 to \u22122.0). This trough is wide and smooth (low local volatility) and STFT again concentrates energy at very low frequencies there. (c) Late-mid positive pulse (~t \u2248 92\u2013108, strong positive SHAP at low freq near ~104): the series exhibits a rapid, large upward swing from about \u22121.8 (around t\u224892\u201396) to a positive peak near +1.3 to +1.5 by t\u2248104\u2013108 (net change ~+3.0 over ~12\u201315 steps, average slope ~+0.2 units/step). This rise is smooth at the large scale (dominated by low-frequency content in STFT) and aligns with a strong positive SHAP block in the lowest-frequency rows, indicating a strong supportive cue. (d) Terminal window (t\u2248125\u2013143): a final smooth climb from a small negative/near-zero value to a large positive endpoint (~+2.4 to +2.6) is present; the SHAP low-frequency signal is modest there. Through all these windows the STFT confirms the discriminative energy lives in the lowest-frequency bins and the SHAP map shows the model rewards slow large-scale lobes (red at bottom rows) and either neutral or negative SHAP for mid-frequency bands during sharper transitions. Volatility is low inside the broad lobes; higher-frequency small wiggles appear in the 60\u201390 range but carry little positive SHAP attribution.\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Global/overall feature summary and temporal dependence: The sample is dominated by a small number (3\u20134) of large, slow low-frequency lobes spaced across the 144 points (early large descent \u2192 early trough, mid/later deep trough, pronounced late-mid upward pulse, final rise to endpoint). The trace is quasi-periodic at a low fundamental frequency: broad peaks and troughs appear roughly every 30\u201350 steps. Large-scale changes are smooth (low volatility) inside each lobe but the transitions between lobes can be relatively steep (and these steeper transitions show some mid-frequency STFT energy and typically reduced or mixed SHAP). The classifier\u2019s SHAP map indicates additive temporal combination: multiple separated low-frequency lobes (at the specific times observed) collectively strengthen the prediction. There is clear time-order dependence \u2014 the early descent and trough precede the mid trough and the late-mid rapid rise; the pattern and ordering of these broad lobes are what the model uses.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries (initial mapping): I compared the sample features with the label summaries: (a) Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): the label_3 description explicitly lists a strong low-frequency downward swing early (t\u224810\u201326), a pronounced deep trough around t\u224848\u201354, a pronounced late-mid large upward swing around t\u224892\u2013106, and a final sustained rise toward the end. Those time-localized low-frequency events, shapes, magnitudes and slopes match this sample almost exactly. (b) Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): also describes multiple low-frequency humps/troughs and early decline, so it shares some similarity (the F-14 closed pattern can be similar in having several lobes). (c) Other labels (0,1,4,5,6): they emphasize different dominant time windows or distinct dominant mid-segment shapes (e.g., label_4 Harrier has a single dominant mid positive hump around t\u224852\u201371 which is not the primary pattern here; label_1 emphasizes a large mid-window oscillation ~39\u201395 but with a different asymmetry; label_0 and label_5/6 have other distinctive timing/amplitude patterns). Therefore initial matching ranks label_3 highest.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Quantified similarity (preliminary): based on the match between the sample\u2019s exact time-located low-frequency lobes, their amplitudes, slopes and the SHAP frequency localization, I give preliminary similarity scores: label_3 = 4 (high similarity), label_2 = 3 (moderate similarity \u2014 shares multi-lobe low-frequency behaviour but timing/ordering differences), labels 0,1,4,5,6 = 2 (low similarity \u2014 they share the overall low-frequency emphasis but differ in the key timing, main hump locations or asymmetry that the model uses for those classes).\",\n    \"Step 5 \u2014 Reference-sample cross-check: I rechecked the four similar reference samples provided \u2014 all are labeled 3 and their raw traces, STFTs and SHAP heatmaps are nearly congruent with the test sample: identical early high start then smooth early descent into a trough near t\u224818\u201325, a mid deep trough near t\u224848\u201354, small higher-frequency wiggles mid-sequence, a pronounced late-mid upward pulse near t\u2248104 and a final positive endpoint. Their SHAP maps show strong red at the same bottom-frequency rows and same time windows. The two dissimilar references (both label 4) show a contrasting dominant mid positive hump around t\u224865\u201378 and different SHAP localization and STFT magnitude patterns; they therefore do not match the test sample. This confirms the earlier mapping and scores and suggests the classifier will favor label 3 for the test trace.\",\n    \"Final decision and justification: The test sample matches label_3 (F-14 wings opened) with high confidence. The decisive evidence is the near-exact alignment of three strongly SHAP-attributed low-frequency events (early broad descent and trough at ~10\u201326, the mid deep trough ~48\u201354, and the late-mid rapid low-frequency rise ~92\u2013106) plus the final terminal rise \u2014 this exact combination, ordering, amplitude and low-frequency dominance is what the label_3 pattern description highlights and what the model\u2019s SHAP map picks out.

Volatility here is mixed: the trough and recovery are low-frequency, but the small oscillations in the 60\u201385 region have slightly higher relative frequency (visible as small mid-frequency content in STFT) and SHAP is weaker/more neutral in those rows. The model down-weights the higher-frequency ripples relative to broad lobes.\\n\\nWindow C: t \u2248 92\u2013108\\n- Manifestation: a rapid large upward swing from a deep trough (~-1.9 around t\u224892) to a positive peak \u2248 +1.4 by t\u2248106 (net change \u2248 +3.3 over ~14 steps; average slope \u2248 +0.22 units/step).

These lobes are smooth, have low internal volatility, and the model's SHAP heatmap attributes most positive weight to the very-low-frequency rows aligned with those lobes.

Typical spacing between major extrema is ~30\u201340 time steps.\\n- Volatility: Low inside the large lobes (smooth ramps). Higher instantaneous slopes occur during transitions (e.g., the steep rise t\u224892\u2013106 and the early drop t\u22480\u201320), which are still mainly low-frequency content but with higher slope magnitude. Small high-frequency ripples between t\u224860\u201385 are present but low amplitude and carry little positive SHAP weight (model discounts them).\\n- Frequency content: STFT shows concentrated energy in the bottom frequency bin during the major lobes; mid-frequency power rises slightly during sharper transitions and the small oscillatory cluster (t\u224860\u201385). The model\u2019s SHAP aligns with the lowest-frequency bins as the principal positive evidence.\\n- Temporal dependence: The model appears to require the particular ordering of lobes (early descent \u2192 mid troughs and pulses \u2192 late big rise).

This maps very closely and specifically to this test sample\u2019s described windows (Window A early drop, Window B mid trough, Window C upward pulse, Window D end rise). The shapes, timings and SHAP low-frequency alignment match strongly.\\n  - Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): also describes multiple low-frequency troughs and humps and positive attribution at low frequencies in several windows; there are similarities (early trough, mid/late troughs), but label-2 patterns emphasize a different arrangement and timing of the main supporting humps/troughs (and the strongest label-2 positive SHAP regions in the summary are at different time windows). The match is decent but not as precise as label 3.\\n  - Other labels (0,1,4,5,6): all emphasize dominant low-frequency content in places, but their specific temporal signatures differ \u2014 e.g., label 4 (Harrier) centers a single dominant mid-segment positive hump that peaks ~52\u201370; label 1 centers a mid-window asymmetric large hump; label 0 and 5/6 have their characteristic timing and asymmetries that do not align as closely with the exact sequence of early trough \u2192 mid trough \u2192 late upward pulse \u2192 final rise that we observe here.\\n\\nPreliminary selection: label 3 has the highest match by timing, shape, low-frequency attribution positions, and the multi-lobe order. I therefore select label 3 as the predicted class.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against reference samples and re-evaluate similarity scoring:\\n- Reference samples 14, 43, 46, 25 are all labelled 3 and their plots are visually nearly identical to the test sample: same large positive start, smooth early descent to a trough ~t\u224818\u201325, large negative trough around t\u224848\u201352, small mid oscillations, a deep trough then a strong rise around t\u2248100, and final large positive endpoint. Their STFTs and SHAP maps likewise show concentrated low-frequency energy and red attribution at the same time windows. This close match confirms the selection of label 3.\\n- Dissimilar reference samples (label 4 shown) have a clear single dominant central positive hump around t\u224852\u201372 and different SHAP localization \u2014 these do not match the multi-lobe trough/pulse structure of the test sample and reinforce that label 4 is not the correct class.\\n\\nQuantified similarity to each label (1\u20134 scale, reasoning):\\n- label 0 (Mirage): 3 (moderate). Some global similarities (low-frequency lobes, early high-to-low-to-high behavior) but the specific timing and the emphasis on mid-window broad peaks in label-0 descriptions are not as tightly matched as label-3.\\n- label 1 (Eurofighter): 2 (low\u2013moderate). Eurofighter emphasizes a mid-window asymmetric rise \u2192 sharp fall pattern; our sample\u2019s dominant events are arranged differently and the mid-window is not the same ordered small-hump\u2192large-hump signature.\\n- label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 3 (moderate). There are shared characteristics (multiple low-frequency troughs/humps) and some temporal alignment, but the precise ordering and the strong SHAP alignment in our sample match label 3 more closely.\\n- label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 4 (high). Timing of early large low-frequency descent (t\u224810\u201326), deep mid trough (~48\u201352), strong late positive pulse (~92\u2013106), and final rise all match the label-3 description and the reference examples almost exactly; STFT and SHAP low-frequency localization match too.\\n- label 4 (Harrier): 1 (no similarity). Harrier shows a single dominant mid hump around t\u224852\u201371 that is not present here as the principal feature; the test sample\u2019s multi-lobe trough/pulse sequence differs strongly.\\n- label 5 (F-22): 2 (low). Some low-frequency lobes occur in both, but the relative magnitudes, timing and SHAP localization differ.\\n- label 6 (F-15): 2 (low). Both emphasize low-frequency envelope but the F-15 patterns and the penalty on mid-frequency abrupt transitions do not align as well with the specific multi-lobe ordering in the test sample.\\n\\nFinal verification and reasoning summary:\\n- Multiple independent checks (timeseries shape, STFT low-frequency localization, and SHAP positive attribution windows) all point to the same characteristic signature described under label 3 (F-14 wings opened). The provided similar reference samples are label-3 and are nearly identical in waveform, STFT and SHAP layout, strengthening the conclusion.\\n- Therefore the most accurate classification is label 3 with high similarity (score 4). The per-label similarity scores above justify why alternative labels were given lower scores.\\n\\nConclusion: predicted label = label 3 (F-14 wings opened). Similarity score for this label: 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}"

Using those time ranges on the time-series: (a) Early window (\u224810\u201326): the series falls from a high start (~+2.6 at t=0) through ~0 at t\u224812 into a smooth low trough near t\u224818 with amplitude \u2248 \u22121.4 to \u22121.6. The descent is largely monotonic and low-volatility (few small wiggles), average slope over the main descent ~ \u22120.15 to \u22120.22 units/step (relatively steep for this sample). STFT shows most energy in the very-low-frequency rows for this interval, consistent with a broad slow downward curvature (a low-frequency lobe) \u2014 and SHAP marks it as positive evidence. (b) Late-mid / late positive pulse (\u2248100\u2013110): the series after mid-section small oscillations undergoes a rapid large-scale rise from a deep negative trough (around t\u224892\u201396, amplitude \u2248 \u22121.6 to \u22121.9) up to a pronounced positive peak near t\u2248104\u2013110 (amplitude \u2248 +1.2 to +1.4). The rise is relatively fast in magnitude (net \u2248 +3.0 over ~12\u201314 steps; average slope \u2248 +0.20 to +0.25 units/step) but the spectral energy remains concentrated at the lowest frequency rows during the main portion of the rise/peak \u2014 the SHAP map therefore attributes that large low-frequency pulse positively. Substructure elsewhere: between ~52\u201390 there are smaller amplitude oscillations (roughly \u22120.5..+0.6) with higher relative local volatility, and the STFT shows weaker but non-zero mid-frequency content there; those mid-frequency components are neutral-to-slightly-negative in SHAP. The final segment (t\u2248125\u2013143) contains a smooth terminal rise back to the high endpoint (~+2.6), with low-frequency energy and modest positive SHAP at the very end, but the two earlier low-frequency events (early trough and late rapid rise) are the dominant positively attributed features.\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Global / overall description and temporal dependence: The trace is dominated by a sequence of large, slow undulations (low-frequency lobes) interleaved with a short window of small, higher-frequency oscillations in the middle. Key global pattern: a high positive start \u2192 sharp broad descent to an early trough (t~10\u201326) \u2192 recovery into a mid positive hump (~t~30\u201338) and then a deep negative trough around t~45\u201352 \u2192 a band of small oscillations around t~55\u201388 (higher relative volatility though small amplitude) \u2192 a deep trough near t~92\u201396 followed by a rapid, large low-frequency rise to a positive peak near t~104\u2013110 \u2192 fall then final smooth rise to the endpoint. Periodicity is quasi-regular at a low fundamental frequency (broad lobes spaced ~30\u201350 steps), not high-frequency repeated cycles. Volatility is heterogeneous: low inside broad lobes (smooth ramps) and higher during the small mid-segment oscillations; the classifier's SHAP prefers the smooth, large-scale lobes and penalizes localized higher-frequency content. The features combine additively in time: early low-frequency descent + mid/late low-frequency pulses and their ordering (early trough then later large rise) form the class-defining signature in this sample.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label patterns (quick mapping): Compare the extracted, attributed patterns with the label feature summaries: (a) Label 3 (F-14 wings opened) summary emphasizes a strong early low-frequency downward swing around t\u224810\u201326, a pronounced deep trough near t\u224846\u201354, a mid window of small higher-frequency oscillations (~60\u201385) that are not strongly attributed, and a rapid, strongly attributed rise/peak around t\u224892\u2013106 with final rise toward the end. That mapping is a near one-to-one match with the sample\u2019s dominant positively attributed events (early trough, mid small oscillations, late rapid low-frequency rise). Therefore label 3 is the best match. (b) Other labels: several (0,1,2,5,6) also rely on low-frequency lobes but differ in the specific timing, sign and ordering of those lobes (for instance label 4 / Harrier expects a single dominant mid positive hump around t\u224852\u201371, which is absent here). Based on feature alignment the highest matching degree is label 3. I therefore choose label 3 with high confidence.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Quantified similarity to each label and cross-check with reference samples: I rechecked the decision against the provided similar and dissimilar reference samples. The four similar references are all labeled 3 and their plots, STFT and SHAP heatmaps are essentially the same waveform motifs as the test sample (early large descent to trough ~t\u224818\u201325, broad deep trough ~48\u201352, band of small oscillations ~60\u201388, and a strong positively attributed rapid rise around ~100\u2013110 with a final rise to the end). The SHAP low-frequency red blocks align in the same time columns across those references and the test sample, confirming the classifier is using the same discriminative features. The two dissimilar samples (labels 4) show a clear central dominant positive hump around ~50\u201370 (Harrier signature) and different SHAP attribution \u2014 those do not match the test sample. Based on that verification I assign similarity scores (1\u20134) relative to each label as follows: label 0: 2, label 1: 2, label 2: 2, label 3: 4, label 4: 1, label 5: 1, label 6: 2.

This is a long-wavelength, low-frequency downward curvature (confirmed by STFT energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins in the same time window).\\n- Substructure & volatility: very low local jitter inside the descent (no sharp spikes), so STFT shows bottom-row energy and SHAP is strongly positive there.\\n\\n2) Mid-sequence deep trough (SHAP positive at low freq around t\u224846\u201356):\\n- Time range: roughly t=44 to t=52 (peak trough at \u224848).\\n- Amplitude & shape: the trace reaches a deep, broad negative minimum (\u2248 -2.0 around t\u224848).

STFT confirms most signal energy in the bottom-most frequency bins during the principal events (early descent, mid trough, late pulse and terminal rise). High-frequency content is weak and small-scale wiggles are either neutral or slightly negative in SHAP.\\n- Periodicity & envelope: the series exhibits a quasi-periodic, multi-lobe envelope: an early large descent, a deep mid trough, a middle stretch of small oscillations, a pronounced late-mid positive pulse, and a final broad rise. The spacing of major extrema (early descent \u2192 trough at ~48 \u2192 late pulse at ~100 \u2192 final rise) shows a consistent low-frequency pattern rather than rapid oscillations.\\n- Volatility: volatility is heterogeneous \u2014 low (smooth) during large-scale ramps and troughs, and slightly higher (small-amplitude wiggles) in the central 50\u201390 window. The classifier's SHAP penalizes mid-frequency volatility while rewarding sustained low-frequency lobes.\\n- Temporal dependence & sequence: important discriminative information is in the ordering: an initial large positive baseline followed by a deep low-frequency descent/trough early-to-mid, then recovery and small oscillations, then a strong late-mid positive pulse, and a final upward bulge. These time-ordered low-frequency lobes combine additively in the model\u2019s evidence (SHAP). The relative timing and sign (positive/negative) of these lobes appear critical to the model decision.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label feature lists and initial similarity scoring:\\n- Compare with label_3 (F-14 wings opened): label_3's description explicitly lists: (a) strong low-frequency downward swing early (t\u224810\u201326) from a high positive start to a deep trough; (b) a pronounced deep trough centered near t\u224848; (c) a prominent positive pulse / rapid rise in the late-mid around t\u224892\u2013106; (d) a final sustained rise near t\u2248130\u2013143. All of these are present in sample 63 with very similar timing, amplitude and low-frequency character. Therefore label_3 is a near-exact match. Similarity score = 4 (high similarity).\\n- Compare with label_2 (F-14 wings closed): label_2 also emphasizes multiple low-frequency troughs and peaks across the series (early fall to trough around t\u224825\u201330, repeated humps, late trough around t\u2248104\u2013120). Sample 63 shares some multi-lobe low-frequency structure, but the precise timings and particularly the strong early descent + trough at \u224848 and the late pulse match label_3's description more closely than label_2. Similarity score = 3 (moderate).\\n- Compare with label_6 (F-15): label_6 describes a persistent low-frequency envelope across the middle of the series with early positive offset and final rise; but it also notes that mid-frequency sharp drops (78\u2192104) are negative evidence for F-15. Sample 63 has some similar envelope behavior but its prominent deep troughs and the ordering match label_3 more closely. Similarity score = 3 (moderate).\\n- Compare with label_0 (Mirage), label_1 (Eurofighter), label_4 (Harrier), label_5 (F-22): these classes emphasize different mid-window signatures \u2014 e.g., label_4 expects a dominant mid positive hump around t\u224852\u201371 (Harrier) which sample 63 does not show (it shows a trough there). The Eurofighter and Mirage patterns emphasize different mid-window asymmetries and rises. F-22 has a primary hump in 36\u201370 and repeated smaller lobes; sample 63\u2019s pattern does not match those as closely. Assign low similarity scores: label_0=2, label_1=2, label_4=1 (low), label_5=2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Rechecking against the provided similar and dissimilar reference samples:\\n- The four 'similar' references are all labeled 3.0 and their raw traces, STFTs and SHAP maps are visually and quantitatively very close to sample 63: same early high start, smooth early decline, pronounced trough at ~48, small central oscillations, late-mid positive pulse near t\u2248104, and terminal rise \u2014 and all emphasize low-frequency energy & red SHAP at the same time windows. This strong agreement with multiple independent labeled examples supports a confident classification as label 3.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' references are labeled 4 (Harrier). Those show a dominant, single big mid positive hump (\u2248t=52\u201371) with positive SHAP concentrated there; sample 63 lacks that dominant mid positive hump and instead has a deep trough in that region, so label 4 is inconsistent with the sample.\\n- Fairness and scoring logic: I weighted exact temporal alignment of major low-frequency lobes, amplitude sign (positive vs negative bulge), width (broad vs narrow), and whether SHAP low-frequency attribution aligns with those lobes. The provided label_3 description matches all these criteria very closely; labels 2 and 6 share some coarse similarities but diverge on key timing/shape points; labels 0/1/4/5 differ more markedly. Therefore assigning label 3 with the highest similarity score 4 is coherent and consistent with reference examples and the feature summaries.\\n\\nFinal conclusion: The sample\u2019s dominant low-frequency features (early strong smooth decline from a high start, deep trough near t\u224848, small central oscillations, a strong late-mid upward pulse around t\u224892\u2013106, and a final terminal rise), the STFT concentration at the lowest frequency bins during those windows, and the SHAP attribution pattern precisely match the label_3 (F-14 wings opened) pattern.

      "{\n    \"result\": [\"label 3\"],\n    \"score\": 4,\n    \"rationale\": [\n        \"Step 1 \u2014 Local (red SHAP) feature inspection and precise description:\\n- Identify red SHAP blocks: The SHAP heatmap shows the strongest positive attribution concentrated at the lowest-frequency rows in two main time windows: an early-to-mid block roughly spanning time steps ~10\u201340 (most intense near the tick positions around 13\u201326\u201339) and a second positive low-frequency block around the late-mid / late window roughly ~100\u2013116 (most visible near the tick at ~104). Smaller/weak positive low-frequency contributions also appear toward the very end but are much weaker.\\n- Map to the time-series trace and describe each red window in detail:\\n  1) Early-to-mid low-frequency block (approx t \u2248 10\u201340):\\n     - Amplitude & trend: The trace starts high (~+2.5 at t=0) and shows a large, smooth downward sweep through this window: it crosses toward zero near t\u224810\u201313 and continues into a wide trough around t\u224818\u201325 (local negative minimum near -1.4 to -1.6). After that trough the series rises smoothly to a pronounced positive local peak around t\u224834\u201338 (peak ~+1.4 to +1.6). This whole event therefore is a broad trough\u2192slow rise\u2192peak low-frequency cycle.\\n     - Change rate & volatility: The descent into the trough is fairly smooth (moderate negative slope), the trough is broad and low-volatility (no sharp spikes), and the recovery to the mid peak is also smooth with a moderate positive slope (~+0.05\u20130.15 units/step on the rise segment). The STFT shows concentrated energy in the lowest frequency bins during this period, confirming the component is a long-wavelength/low-frequency event.\\n     - Substructure & shape: Substructure is low-volatility: a clear large-scale convex-down curvature into the trough, then a single broad convex-up ramp to the mid peak; no strong high-frequency ripples dominate here. This matches the SHAP low-frequency red attribution.\\n  2) Late-mid positive block (approx t \u2248 100\u2013116):\\n     - Amplitude & trend: In the trace around t\u224892\u2013106 there is a large positive pulse: a relatively fast and high-amplitude rise from a negative/near-zero level to a local positive peak around t\u2248104\u2013110 (peak ~+1.2 to +1.5), followed by a descent. SHAP attributes this rising-and-peak portion (low-frequency rows) strongly positive.\\n     - Change rate & volatility: This rise is steeper than the earlier slow ramps (higher instantaneous slope on the ascent, though still dominated by low-frequency energy). STFT again concentrates energy at the lowest frequencies in this time band, supporting the SHAP attribution.\\n  3) End-sequence rise (t \u2248 125\u2013143):\\n     - Amplitude & trend: From about t\u2248125 onward the series climbs to a large endpoint (~+2.6 at 143). SHAP shows only modest low-frequency positive attribution here (weaker than the two main red blocks). STFT shows low-frequency content reappearing toward the end.\\n- Neutral/negative aspects: There are small higher-frequency oscillations (short wiggles) in the 60\u201390 region and a sharper negative dip around 46\u201352 (a deep trough near -2.0 around t\u224848\u201352) which correspond to some mid/high-frequency STFT energy but those are not strongly positively attributed in SHAP. In fact, SHAP is neutral/mixed there; the model emphasizes the large low-frequency lobes described above.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and relationships between features:\\n- Dominant behavior: The series is dominated by large-scale, low-frequency undulations (several broad lobes across 144 steps). The STFT confirms most signal energy relevant to SHAP resides in the lowest frequency bins; higher-frequency energy is sparse and localized to sharper transitions.\\n- Sequence & temporal dependence: The key events are temporally ordered and phase-consistent: an early large descent into a wide trough (t\u224810\u201325), a smooth broad recovery to a mid positive peak (t\u224834\u201338), a later deep negative trough (t\u224848 with the deepest around 48\u201352), small-amplitude mid oscillations (t\u224860\u201390) and a strong late-mid positive pulse (t\u2248100\u2013116) followed by a final large rise toward the end. The classifier\u2019s SHAP map emphasizes the early-to-mid and late-mid low-frequency bulges, showing the model is using both timing and amplitude of these broad contour features.\\n- Volatility profile: Low volatility inside the major lobes (smooth ramps), with higher instantaneous slopes during the ascent into the late-mid pulse and during the final rise. Small high-frequency jitter appears in the mid sequence but carries little positive attribution.\\n- Combination: The model\u2019s positive evidence arises from multiple separated low-frequency lobes combining additively (early broad trough\u2192rise plus the late-mid positive pulse and final rise). Rapid or higher-frequency components tend to be neutral/negative for the label score.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching against provided label feature summaries and choosing the best label:\\n- Compare to label descriptions:\\n  - Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): Its summary emphasizes several large slow oscillations (early downward swing t\u224810\u201326, deep trough mid, a late large upward swing near t\u224892\u2013106 and a final sustained rise). The SHAP pattern described for label 3 is very similar to what we observe: positive attribution concentrated at the lowest-frequency band during early descent and the late-mid/late rises and pulses. The test sample\u2019s dominant low-frequency events (early decline into trough, broad recovery to mid peak, deep trough later, late-mid positive pulse and final rise) closely match label 3\u2019s pattern.\\n  - Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): Also shows multiple low-frequency trough/hump structure with strong positive attribution at several windows (early fall and repeated humps). There are some similarities (multi-lobe low-frequency behavior), but label 2 descriptions put particular emphasis on different timing (e.g., different alignment of mid humps and a strong late trough around 104\u2013120). The test sample aligns better with the timing and combination described for label 3 than label 2.\\n  - Labels 0,1,4,5,6: Each of these emphasizes different primary signatures: e.g., label 4 (Harrier) centers on a dominant mid-segment large positive hump around t\u224852\u201371 which our sample does not have (our mid large hump is earlier/structured differently); label 1 emphasizes a mid-segment asymmetric large hump (timing and ordering differ); labels 0,5,6 emphasize other specific patterns (different timing, amplitude ordering, or penalize the sharper events we see). Overall, these other labels show only partial or weak overlap with sample 63's pattern.\\n- Preliminary similarity scoring per label (1\u20134):\\n  - label 0 (Mirage): 2 \u2014 shares low-frequency emphasis but timing/shape (three broad undulations with different placement) do not match well.\\n  - label 1 (Eurofighter): 2 \u2014 some broad mid cycles in common but the distinctive mid-window asymmetry/ordering for label 1 is not the dominant feature here.\\n  - label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 3 \u2014 moderate similarity (multi-lobe low-frequency structure), but the particular relative timing and the strong late trough described for label 2 differ slightly from sample 63; still moderately similar.\\n  - label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 4 \u2014 high similarity: early large slow descent into a wide trough, multiple separated low-frequency lobes, a pronounced late-mid positive pulse and a final rise are all described in label 3\u2019s summary and are present in the sample; reference examples for label 3 closely match the sample.\\n  - label 4 (Harrier): 2 \u2014 Harrier expects a dominant mid-window single big hump (~t=52\u201371), which sample 63 lacks in the same form; therefore low similarity.\\n  - label 5 (F-22): 2 \u2014 F-22 patterns emphasize a different mid-hump shape and endpoint behavior; only generic low-frequency behavior is shared.\\n  - label 6 (F-15): 2 \u2014 again shares the low-frequency envelope idea, but specific shapes/timing differ.\\n- Chosen label: label 3 has the highest match (score 4). This is consistent with the strong alignment of the sample\u2019s early-to-mid and late-mid low-frequency bulges with label 3\u2019s described prototypical signature.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against the provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The 4 similar reference samples (samples 14, 89, 43, 39) are all labeled 3 in the reference set and their plotted time-series, STFT, and SHAP maps are visually extremely close to sample 63: they show the same early high start \u2192 deep early trough \u2192 broad recovery to a mid peak \u2192 deep trough around 48\u201352 \u2192 small mid wiggles \u2192 a strong late-mid positive bulge around 100\u2013110 \u2192 final rise. Their SHAP maps show the same concentrated red at the lowest frequencies in the early and late-mid windows. This near one-to-one match supports label 3 strongly.\\n- The dissimilar samples (label 4 examples 85 and 45) show a very different dominant mid hump (strong positive around t\u224860\u201375 in those samples) and their SHAP low-frequency emphasis is localized to different time windows; they do not match the distinctive early trough + late-mid pulse ordering we see in sample 63. This reduces the plausibility of label 4.\\n- Consistency and fairness: The scoring logic favored timing, number and ordering of large low-frequency lobes (the key discriminative elements in the dataset background). Given that sample 63\u2019s exact timing and low-frequency attribution match the label 3 prototypes and training examples, assigning label 3 with highest similarity (4) is consistent and fair. Label 2 is the second-closest due to multi-lobe similarity but differs in the relative placement and prominence of the late trough/peak features.\\n\\nFinal conclusion: The sample is best explained as label 3 (F-14 wings opened). The model\u2019s SHAP attribution highlights the exact low-frequency events that define this class and the provided reference examples for label 3 match sample 63 very closely. Therefore the final classification is label 3 with similarity score 4 (high similarity).\"\n    ]\n}",

These are the time windows the classifier relies on.\\n- Corresponding waveform details for the early-mid red window (~13\u201339): the series begins very high (~+2.5 at t\u22480) then falls steadily to a wide trough around t\u224820\u201326 (amplitude \u2248 -1.4 to -1.6). After that trough there is a smooth, low-volatility upward sweep reaching a local positive peak near t\u224834\u201338 (amplitude \u2248 +1.4\u20131.6). Change rates: the initial fall is relatively steep (large negative slope across ~12\u201315 steps), while the subsequent rise is moderate and smooth (~+0.08\u2013+0.12 units/step). STFT confirms that energy in this interval is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins (broad-scale shape); the SHAP positive attribution aligns with those low-frequency bins, indicating the model is using this slow trough\u2192rise motif as positive evidence.\\n- Corresponding waveform details for the later red window (~104\u2013117): the plot shows a deep negative trough slightly earlier (~t\u224892\u201396, amplitude \u2248 -1.8 to -2.0) followed by a rapid, large low-frequency upward pulse between ~t\u224896 and ~t\u2248110 rising to \u2248+1.2\u2013+1.4. This upward pulse (broad but relatively brisk) carries strong low-frequency STFT magnitude and strong positive SHAP in the lowest bins. The final segment after ~t\u2248125 shows another pronounced smooth rise to the end (~+2.4 at t=143) with some positive low-frequency SHAP but weaker than the two main blocks.\\n- Volatility and substructure: within the red-attributed windows volatility is low (smooth ramps, few high-frequency wiggles). Between those windows (approx t\u224852\u201392) there are small amplitude, higher-frequency oscillations (short wiggles of amplitude \u22480.1\u20130.5) with low STFT energy at mid/higher frequencies; these are neutral-to-slightly negative in SHAP and do not drive the classification.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Dominant mode: the trace is dominated by large, low-frequency lobes (broad peaks/troughs) and a final strong end rise. There are roughly 3\u20134 large-scale undulations across the 144 points: early high \u2192 deep trough (t~0\u219225), smooth rebound to a mid positive hump (~25\u219238), a deep mid/late trough (~48\u219252 and again ~92), and a final strong terminal ascent (~125\u2192143).\\n- Frequency content: STFT shows most energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during the key windows (early-mid and late pulses). Mid/high frequencies are weak overall and the SHAP map penalizes mid-frequency content in some ranges \u2014 the model prefers smooth, broad contour features rather than sharp edges.\\n- Temporal dependence: the positive SHAP windows occur at consistent, separated locations (early-mid and late) and combine additively to push the prediction toward a class. The ordering (early trough\u2192rise, mid troughs, late strong rise) and low volatility within lobes are salient.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and selection of best label:\\n- Compare to label_3 (F-14 wings opened): the label_3 description emphasizes multiple large low-frequency oscillations (early downward deflection ~t\u224810\u201326, pronounced mid troughs, late large upward pulses), low volatility in lobes, and strong SHAP at lowest frequency bands in the same time windows. The test sample matches these items closely: timing, sign and amplitude of troughs/peaks, STFT low-frequency concentration, and SHAP positive blocks align with label_3's prototypical signature. => High similarity.\\n- Quick comparisons to other labels: label_2 (F-14 wings closed) also emphasizes several low-frequency troughs/peaks and a late rise \u2014 moderately similar but the wings-closed pattern in the summary places slightly different emphases/timings; label_0/1/5/6/4 have low-frequency components but their characteristic mid-window signs (e.g., label_4 expects a dominant mid positive hump) do not match as well. Quantified similarity (1\u20134) judged from feature alignment: label_0:2, label_1:2, label_2:3, label_3:4, label_4:1, label_5:2, label_6:2.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four provided 'similar' reference examples are all labeled 3 and their waveforms, STFT energy concentration, and SHAP heatmaps are visually and quantitatively near-identical to the test sample: same early decline-to-trough around t\u224820\u201330, similar mid low-frequency humps, same late trough\u2192rise and concentrated lowest-frequency SHAP blocks near ~13\u201339 and ~104\u2013117. The two dissimilar examples (label 4) show a dominant mid positive hump (~52\u201371) not present in the test sample, confirming that label_4 is a poor match. The minor differences between sample 63 and the label_3 references are within expected intra-class variability (amplitude offsets and slight timing shifts) and do not contradict classification.\\n\\nConclusion: The test sample matches the label_3 (F-14 wings opened) pattern very closely (high similarity). Final assigned label: label 3 with similarity score 4 (high similarity). The per-label similarity estimates used in validation were: label_0:2, label_1:2, label_2:3, label_3:4, label_4:1, label_5:2, label_6:2.\"\n  ]\n}"

There is also modest low-frequency positive mass toward the final edge (t \u2248 130\u2013143).\\n- Corresponding time-series features (fine-grained):\\n  - t \u2248 10\u201330: the trace shows a large, smooth downward swing from a high start (~+2.6 at t=0) through a zero crossing near t\u224812 to a broad trough near t\u224818\u201326 at about -1.4 to -1.6. Change rate: large negative average slope over ~12\u201318 steps (fast relative to other ramps). Volatility inside the trough is low (smooth). STFT: strong energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins for this interval, confirming a slow, large-scale curvature. This block aligns with the strongest positive SHAP, so the model treats this broad descent + trough as highly supportive.\\n  - t \u2248 46\u201354: the series reaches another pronounced negative minimum near t\u224848\u201354 (~-2.0) after a preceding rise; STFT again shows low-frequency power; SHAP gives modest positive attribution at bottom rows here (a reinforcing low-frequency trough). This trough is wide (8\u201312 steps) and smooth \u2014 another low-frequency discriminative lobe.\\n  - t \u2248 92\u2013108: there is a rapid, large low-frequency upward pulse from a deep negative (~-1.8 around t\u224892) up to a positive peak (~+1.3 at t\u2248104\u2013108) and then a fall. This segment has strong low-frequency STFT energy and aligns with a second clear red SHAP block, indicating the classifier values this large upward pulse (magnitude \u22483.0 over ~12\u201316 steps; average slope positive large). Volatility within the rise is low (smooth ramp) but the ascent is relatively steep compared with earlier ramps.\\n  - t \u2248 120\u2013143 (end): the series drops again (~t=115 trough ~-1.2) then shows a sustained final rise to ~+2.6 at t=143. The STFT shows low-frequency energy and SHAP shows modest positive attribution near the end \u2014 a supportive terminal bulge.\\n- Frequency detail: STFT confirms that all highly SHAP-attributed events are dominated by the lowest-frequency bins (coarse, long-wavelength shape). Mid/high-frequency bins show little energy during these windows; where mid-frequency energy is present (transitions), SHAP tends to be neutral or slightly negative. Thus the discriminative cues are broad smooth lobes (not rapid spikes).\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall series features and temporal relationships:\\n- Global trend & periodicity: the series exhibits a quasi-periodic, low-frequency envelope composed of 3\u20134 large-scale lobes (early large descent/trough, mid trough around t\u224848\u201354, late positive pulse around t\u2248100\u2013108, final rise to the end). These lobes are separated by ~30\u201350 time steps and are the dominant pattern. There is no persistent high-frequency oscillation; most variability is slow and smooth.\\n- Volatility: within the large lobes volatility is low (smooth ramps). Steeper transitions occur when the series climbs rapidly (e.g., the late-mid rise to t\u2248104), but these are still dominated by low-frequency energy. Small higher-frequency wiggles occur in the 60\u201385 range but carry little STFT power and near-neutral SHAP, so they are not primary.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: the classifier appears to sum evidence from multiple separated low-frequency events. The early deep trough + later big upward pulse + final terminal rise together form a temporally ordered signature.

The test sample does not show a single dominant mid hump in that window; instead it shows a deep trough around t\u224848\u201354 and a separate later large pulse around t\u2248100\u2013108. Therefore the test sample differs significantly from label 4's key mid hump pattern.\\n- Labels 0,1,2,5,6: their summaries emphasize different temporal patterns (e.g., label 0 & 1: mid-window gradual rises with different phasing; label 2: early decline and particular trough timing; label 5 & 6: different positions/amplitudes of lobes). None of these match as closely as label 3 does in timing & structure.\\nConclusion from Step 3: label 3 is the best match (highest degree). I assign the chosen label (label 3) a similarity score of 4 (high similarity) because nearly every distinctive event described in label-3\u2019s pattern (early descent to trough, mid deep trough, late big upward pulse, final rise; all low-frequency) appears in the test series with matching timing, amplitude and SHAP attribution.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Recheck against provided reference samples and fairness check:\\n- The four similar reference plots (Samples 14, 89, 67, 104) are all labeled 3 and are visually nearly identical to the test sample: same early high \u2192 drop to trough near t\u224818\u201326, large trough near t\u224848\u201354, small mid oscillations around 60\u201385, deep trough ~90\u201395 then big rise ~100\u2013110 and final edge rise. Their STFTs also show concentrated energy at the lowest frequency bins in the same time windows, and their SHAP heatmaps show the same low-frequency red bands at t\u224813\u201330 and t\u2248100\u2013120. This confirms the test sample belongs to the same pattern cluster as those label-3 references.\\n- The two dissimilar reference samples (label 4) highlight a strong central hump near t\u224850\u201370 with strongest SHAP attribution there \u2014 this is not present in the test sample. That reinforces the decision that label 4 is unlikely for the test sample.\\n- Scoring fairness: all distinguishing criteria used (timing of lobes, sign and amplitude of extrema, low-frequency dominance per STFT, SHAP red alignment) are consistent across the test sample and label-3 references. There is no apparent bias in scoring \u2014 the test sample matches label 3 strongly on multiple independent axes (time, amplitude, frequency, SHAP attribution). Other labels lack the same multi-aspect match.\\nFinal decision: label 3 (F-14 wings opened). Similarity score: 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

Amplitude span in this window is ~4.0 units (from start +2.6 down to -1.5 and back up to ~+1.5). The change rates are large on the initial fall (\u2248 -0.15 to -0.22 units/step over ~12\u201318 steps) and moderate on the subsequent smooth rise (\u2248 +0.08\u2013+0.12 units/step). Volatility inside the trough and the rising flank is low (no sharp spikes) \u2014 STFT shows concentrated energy in the lowest frequency bins during this interval, confirming that this is a slow, broad, DC-like curvature rather than high-frequency detail. This low-frequency trough\u2192rise shape is precisely the structure producing the strong positive SHAP values in that time/frequency region.\",\n    \"2) Secondary positive SHAP block #2 (lowest-frequency rows, centered near time tick ~104\u2013130): corresponds to a large late positive pulse and the final rise. In the time plot there is a pronounced upward swing between roughly t\u224892\u2013106: the signal climbs from a deep negative value (~-1.8 near t\u224892) up to a clear positive peak (~+1.3\u2013+1.4 around t\u2248104\u2013110). After that the series falls somewhat and then executes a final sustained climb from roughly t\u2248125 to the end (t=143) reaching another very large endpoint (~+2.6). The main late pulse (t\u224892\u2013106) average slope is high (~+0.18\u2013+0.24 units/step across the rise) and the terminal rise (125\u2013143) is also fast and large in amplitude (~+0.15\u2013+0.2 units/step). STFT again shows that these events are dominated by energy in the lowest frequency bins, matching the red low-frequency SHAP at these columns. Volatility during the late positive pulse is moderate to low (smooth large-scale change), with the most rapid change occurring at the onset of the pulse.\",\n    \"3) Intervening mid-segment (roughly t\u224850\u201390) shows small-amplitude, higher-frequency oscillations (several quick wiggles around zero, amplitude \u00b10.4\u20130.6). The SHAP map in these columns is neutral or weak (no strong red) and STFT shows comparatively more mid-frequency energy there \u2014 these features are not positively attributed and sometimes slightly negative, indicating the classifier discounts sharp, higher-frequency local texture in favour of the slow lobes described above.\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 overall time-series summary and dependence:\",\n    \"4) Global shape & periodicity: the sample is dominated by a small number (3\u20134) of large, slow undulations (low-frequency lobes) spaced across the 144 points: an early high\u2192deep trough\u2192broad mid-rise cycle (0\u201339), a mid trough around t\u224848\u201352, small rapid fluctuations in the middle (\u224852\u201390), and a strong late negative\u2192positive pulse and terminal rise (\u224892\u2013143). This produces concentrated STFT energy at the very low frequency bins during the early and late lobes and weaker higher-frequency content in the mid region. There is quasi-periodic structure (broad half-cycles spaced \u224830\u201350 steps) but not rapid repetition \u2014 the signal is best described as low-frequency, multi-lobe contour waveform with intermittent higher-frequency texture.\",\n    \"5) Volatility and change-rate summary: volatility is heterogeneous \u2014 very low (smooth ramps) inside major lobes and troughs, higher (small wiggles) in the mid-segment. Large slopes occur at the early fall and the later rises; the classifier rewards slow, wide curvature (low-frequency) and penalizes sharper/fast transitions at mid frequencies (matching SHAP penalizations at mid-frequency rows).\",\n    \"6) Temporal dependence and combination: the classifier\u2019s positive evidence accumulates where broad low-frequency bulges/troughs occur (early trough\u2192rise and the late positive pulse + final climb). The ordering (early trough then mid small oscillations then late pulse then terminal rise) matters: the model appears to treat that sequence as a composite signature rather than independent isolated spikes.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 match to label feature summaries and selection:\",\n    \"7) Compare to provided label patterns: Examining the per-label summaries, label 3 (F-14 wings opened) is described as: strong low-frequency early downward swing (t\u224810\u201326), a deep mid trough around t\u224848\u201354, mid-segment small higher-frequency oscillations (~60\u201385), and a prominent late positive pulse/rapid rise (t\u224892\u2013106) plus a final sustained rise toward the end. Those textual features match the test sample 66 closely: the same early large downward deflection, a deep trough near t\u224850, small mid wiggles, and a pronounced late positive pulse followed by an end rise. The SHAP heatmap for sample 66 shows positive attribution concentrated exactly on the low-frequency bands in the early and late windows emphasized in the label-3 summary. The four retrieved similar reference samples are all label 3 and their time-plots, STFTs and SHAP maps are visually and structurally nearly identical to sample 66 (same timing of low-frequency red bands at ~13\u201339 and ~104\u2013130 and similar waveform morphology).\",\n    \"8) Exclude other labels: - Labels 0,1,2,5,6 share the general property of low-frequency lobes in places, but their characteristic timing/ordering and shapes differ. For example label 1 (Eurofighter) focuses on a dominant mid-segment asymmetric cycle (t\u224839\u201395) as primary evidence, but sample 66\u2019s strongest SHAP mass is early and late rather than the central mid-only bulge. Label 4 (Harrier) has a dominant single central hump near t\u224852\u201371 which is not the main positive SHAP region for sample 66 (sample 66\u2019s central hump is weaker and not the strongest positive attribution). Labels 0,2,5,6 have their own distinctive timing/amplitude patterns that do not match the exact early trough + mid wiggle + late pulse ordering seen here.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 verification with reference examples & fairness check:\",\n    \"9) The reference samples provided (Samples 14, 89, 67, 104) are all annotated label 3 and are extremely similar to the test sample in waveform shape, STFT low-frequency hotspots, and SHAP attribution layout (same low-frequency red blocks at the early and late windows). Dissimilar examples (label 4 samples 85 and 45) show a different main positive SHAP locus (strong central hump) and different waveform timing \u2014 these contrast examples confirm the test sample is not label 4. The similarity scores and logic are consistent: visual/quantitative matches on timing, amplitude, slope, volatility and frequency content are strong between sample 66 and label 3 exemplars.\",\n    \"Conclusion and final decision:\",\n    \"10) Given the near-complete match in (a) location of SHAP positive blocks (low-frequency early and late windows), (b) the precise time-domain morphology (early large fall and smooth recovery, mid small oscillations, a late large positive pulse and terminal rise), and (c) matching STFT low-frequency concentration, the sample best matches label 3 (F-14 wings opened). I assign a high similarity score (4/4) to label 3 because a nearly identical feature description exists in the label-3 summary and the four retrieved reference samples are visually and spectrally almost indistinguishable from the test sample. The sample shows only minor, expected within-class variability (slight differences in exact amplitudes or minor mid wiggles) and no strong evidence supporting any alternate label.\"\n  ]\n}",

The order and relative timing of these lobes matter (e.g., the early descent preceding the mid hump and the late positive pulse preceding the final endpoint rise).

Manifestation: a monotonic, low-volatility downward ramp (very low-frequency / DC-like curvature). Average local change rate is large negative (~ -0.13 to -0.22 units/step during the descent). STFT: strong energy concentrated in the lowest-frequency bin in the same window, confirming the event is a broad, slow change. SHAP: strongly positive there \u2014 the model treats this smooth broad descent (a major concavity in the contour) as positive evidence.\",\n    \"b) Mid / central low-frequency contributions (smaller red at lowest-frequency rows around t\u224852\u201370): In the time series there is a large, smooth negative peak near t\u224850\u201352 (amplitude \u2248 -2.0) followed by a recovery and a broad positive hump roughly t\u224852\u201370 that reaches moderate positive values (~+0.5 to +0.8). Manifestation: a wide, low-frequency trough centered ~50 followed by a slow rise to a moderate positive lobe. Volatility inside these lobes is low, and STFT shows low-frequency energy across this block. SHAP assigns moderate positive weight to the low-frequency rows here, indicating the model uses the timing of this deep trough + recovery pattern as evidence.\",\n    \"c) Late-mid to late positive pulse (strong SHAP red at low frequencies around t\u2248100\u2013130): On the plot this maps to a relatively rapid large upward swing beginning near t\u224892 (trough \u2248 -1.7), rising to an intermediate positive peak around t\u2248104\u2013110 (\u2248 +1.1 to +1.3), then a further descent to a shallow valley ~t\u2248118\u2013125 before a final strong ascent to the end. The SHAP red emphasis is on the low-frequency band during the rising portions ~104\u2013130 and also weaker at the final rise (t\u2248130\u2013143). STFT again concentrates energy at the lowest frequencies in these windows, confirming these are broad-scale bulges rather than high-frequency spikes. The change rates here include a fairly rapid rise from trough to local peak (average slope up to \u2248 +0.18\u2013+0.25 units/step) but the spectral energy remains low-frequency because it is a large-amplitude, sustained swing.\",\n    \"Summary of Task 1: All strongly red (positive) SHAP regions align with broad, low-frequency events: an early large descent into a trough (\u2248t\u22488\u201326), a central deep trough and recovery (\u2248t\u224848\u201370), and a late rising pulse (\u2248t\u2248100\u2013143).

The global range is large (~ -2.0 to +2.6).\",\n    \"2) Periodicity and frequency content: The signal is dominated by very-low-frequency / long-wavelength components (STFT concentrated at bottom rows at the times of interest). The behavior is quasi-periodic at long timescales with roughly 2\u20133 large-scale lobes across 144 points rather than many rapid cycles.\",\n    \"3) Volatility & change rates: Volatility is low inside the broad lobes (smooth ramps), with intermittent faster transitions between lobes (notable around the late rise) that produce modest mid-frequency energy but are not the primary features. Faster mid-frequency bursts (where visible in STFT) tend to coincide with sharper transitions and are not strongly supported by SHAP (often neutral or slightly negative at mid freqs).\",\n    \"4) Temporal dependence & combination: The classifier appears to use the sequence and timing of broad lobes (early descent \u2192 deep mid trough \u2192 recovery/hump \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise). The ordering is important: early trough then mid trough then late rise form a distinctive signature; SHAP highlights these windows additively (multiple positive low-frequency blocks strengthen the label score).\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match against provided label feature lists and selection:\",\n    \"I compared the observed features to each label's summary.

Other labels (for example label_4 Harrier) emphasize a dominant central positive hump (a big mid positive bulge) which the current series does not have as the primary mid feature; instead the mid feature here is a deep trough.

Corresponding raw trace: a large, smooth downward deflection that begins at a high positive value near +2.6 at t\u22480, crosses zero around t\u224812, and reaches a wide trough near t\u224816\u201320 with amplitude about \u22121.3 to \u22121.6.

STFT: strong energy concentrated at the bottom frequency rows during this interval, confirming the event is a low-frequency / large-scale contour change.

Raw trace: a deep negative trough centered \u2248t\u224848\u201352 reaching \u2248\u22122.0 (the sample's global minimum). Feature details: trough width \u2248 8\u201312 steps (broad), low volatility inside the trough, STFT energy again concentrated at very low frequencies.

STFT: low-frequency dominance in this window. Feature details: the ascent is large-amplitude and low-frequency (broad pulse) though a little faster than the earliest descent.

Between those events there are lower-amplitude, faster wiggles but they carry little positive SHAP attribution.\",\n    \"  - Periodicity & frequency: The dominant energy (STFT) concentrates in the lowest frequency bins during the three main macro-events. The waveform is quasi-periodic at a long timescale (~40\u201360 step spacing between major extrema) rather than rapidly oscillatory. Shorter, higher-frequency ripples exist between major lobes but are low-power and either neutral or slightly negative in SHAP.\",\n    \"  - Volatility & change rates: Volatility is low inside the broad lobes (smooth monotonic ramps). Change rates are larger during the sharper transitions (e.g., the large up-swing near t\u2248100 is faster than the earliest descent), and these sharper transitions show slightly more mid-frequency energy but the classifier still primarily attributes the low-frequency component positively.\",\n    \"  - Temporal dependence / ordering: The order of events matters.

I identify the strongest positive SHAP windows (approximate indices by the tick marks shown): early block around t\u224810\u201330 (strongest), a mid/late block around t\u224860\u201378 (weak\u2013moderate), a clear strong block around t\u2248100\u2013108, and a modest positive block again toward the very end t\u2248130\u2013143.\\n- Corresponding plot features for each red window (exact numerical descriptions):\\n  1) Early window ~t=0\u201330 (SHAP red centered ~13\u201326): the series starts very high (~+2.6 at t=0), declines through ~0 by t\u224812 then continues down to a local trough near t\u224818 at about \u22121.4 to \u22121.6. This descent is smooth and low-volatility (no high-frequency jitter), with an average slope over the initial drop of roughly \u22120.18 to \u22120.22 units/step (fast in global terms). STFT for this window shows concentrated energy at the lowest frequency bins, confirming a large-scale low-frequency ramp. Shape: long monotonic downward curvature (broad concave segment).\\n  2) Mid window ~t=36\u201356 (SHAP moderate around the low freqs near the 52 tick): the trace rises from negative values after the early trough to a broad positive hump (peak near t\u224834\u201336 around +1.4\u2013+1.5) then falls to a deep trough centered roughly at t\u224848\u201352 (min \u2248 \u22122.0). The hump and trough are broad (widths ~10\u201320 steps) and low-volatility inside each lobe; STFT again places most power at the bottom frequency rows. Shape: a large smooth peak followed by a broad trough (low-frequency lobe).\\n  3) Late-mid window ~t=92\u2013108 (SHAP strong at lowest freq around the 104 tick): there is a pronounced, relatively rapid upward swing from a negative baseline (\u2248 \u22121.8 around t\u224892) to a positive peak around t\u2248104\u2013106 (\u2248 +1.3 to +1.4). Net change \u2248 +3.0 over ~12\u201314 steps (average slope \u2248 +0.20 to +0.25 units/step). Although the rise is faster than the broad lobes, STFT still shows dominant low-frequency content in that block and the SHAP bottom-row is strongly positive \u2014 the classifier treats this large low-frequency pulse as highly supportive. Shape: broad low-frequency pulse with fairly steep ascent.\\n  4) Final window t\u2248130\u2013143 (smaller but positive SHAP at lowest freq): the series makes a steady final climb from near 0 (or slightly negative) to a terminal maximum about +2.5 at t=143. This final rise is smooth, low-volatility and dominated by low-frequency energy; average slope is ~+0.18\u2013+0.20 units/step across the final ~13 steps. Shape: terminal broad convex rise.\\n- Frequency-domain corroboration: the STFT shows the majority of discriminative magnitude in the lowest-frequency bins during these same intervals (bottom rows bright in STFT at matching times). Higher-frequency rows show only small energy (and correspond in SHAP to near-neutral or weak negative contributions), confirming the classifier is relying on slow, large-scale contour components in these windows.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and dependence between features:\\n- Global trend & periodicity: the time series is dominated by a small number (3\u20134) of broad, low-frequency lobes (large-scale undulations) spaced across the 144 points: an early large descent, a mid positive hump then deep trough, a late-mid strong positive pulse, and a final broad rise to the endpoint. The effective low-frequency \u2018\u2018period\u2019\u2019 between large extrema is on the order of 35\u201355 time steps. This yields a quasi-periodic low-frequency envelope rather than rapid repeated oscillations.\\n- Volatility: volatility is heterogeneous \u2014 within broad lobes volatility is low (smooth ramps), while transitions between lobes can be steeper (notably the late-mid rise). Small higher-frequency oscillations of low amplitude are visible in the middle of the sequence (\u2248t=60\u201380) but they carry little STFT energy and near-neutral SHAP, so they are treated as incidental texture rather than primary cues.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: the classifier appears to use the relative timings and ordering of these broad lobes (early descent \u2192 mid hump & trough \u2192 late positive pulse \u2192 final rise) as a composite signature. The low-frequency events are temporally separated and combine additively in the model's attribution (multiple positive low-frequency blocks increase the overall class logit). Mid-frequency or sharp transitions around t\u224878\u201395 correspond to negative/neutral SHAP and slightly reduce confidence when present, but they do not override the overall low-frequency signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and initial label selection:\\n- Compare the observed pattern with each label summary (key matches):\\n  * Label 0 (Mirage): emphasizes multiple broad low-frequency lobes (e.g., trough\u2192slow rise mid-window and strong terminal rise). Some elements (terminal rise, low-frequency lobes) are shared but the Mirage summaries focus on different timing (notably strong mid-window rise 26\u201365). Similarity: low\u2013moderate (score 2).\\n  * Label 1 (Eurofighter): emphasizes a dominant mid-segment asymmetric low-frequency cycle in ~39\u201395 and a late rise but specifically a pattern of a smaller hump then larger hump at ~72. Test sample has broad mid trough and later pulse but lacks the exact small-then-large hump mid pattern. Similarity: low\u2013moderate (score 2).\\n  * Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): includes an early large decline and pronounced troughs at several windows and a late rapid rise \u2014 some overlap with the test (early fall, multiple troughs). However label-2's timing and repetition differ (and the test has the distinctive big late positive pulse around ~104 associated with label_3). Similarity: moderate (score 3).\\n  * Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): description strongly matches the test: large early low-frequency downward segment (t\u224810\u201326), a pronounced trough near t\u224848\u201354, small higher-frequency oscillations in the 60\u201385 region, a prominent positive pulse around t\u224892\u2013106, and a final sustained rise at the end. The STFT/SHAP emphasis on bottom-frequency rows in the same windows is explicitly described for label 3. Similarity: high (score 4).\\n  * Label 4 (Harrier): characterized by a dominant mid-series large positive hump roughly t\u224852\u201371; the test does not show a single dominating mid hump there \u2014 instead it has a trough in that area. Similarity: low (score 1).\\n  * Label 5 (F-22): emphasizes a broad positive hump in the mid 36\u201370 region and repeated smaller lobes \u2014 test differs because its mid region contains a deep trough rather than a dominant positive hump. Similarity: low (score 1).\\n  * Label 6 (F-15): describes persistent low-frequency envelope with twin peaks around 65 and 78 and penalizes abrupt mid-frequency transitions; test shares the persistent low-frequency envelope but its particular sequence of troughs and the strong pulse at t\u2248104 better match label 3. Similarity: low\u2013moderate (score 2).\\n- Based on the direct alignment of temporal positions, shapes (broad low-frequency lobes, a deep trough near t\u224848\u201354, a strong late-mid positive pulse near t\u224892\u2013106, and final rise), STFT concentration at the lowest frequencies, and the SHAP positive blocks exactly where label_3 descriptions expect them, the best match is label 3 (F-14 wings opened). I therefore select label 3 as the predicted class.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with the provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four similar reference samples supplied (samples 43, 46, 104, 59) are all labeled 3 and their plots are visually almost identical to the test trace: same early high then decline, similar deep trough around t\u224848\u201354, similar small oscillatory center region, a pronounced positive pulse near t\u2248104\u2013106, and a final rise toward the end. Their STFTs also show the same bottom-row energy concentrations and their SHAP maps highlight the same low-frequency windows (strong red in bottom rows near the same time positions). This is a strong confirmation that the observed pattern belongs to the label-3 cluster.\\n- The two dissimilar references (label 4 examples) emphasize a large mid-series positive hump (t\u224852\u201371) which is not present in the test; their STFTs/SHAP differ accordingly. This contrast supports rejecting label 4.\\n- Considering (i) direct match of timing & shape of the large low-frequency events, (ii) STFT agreement (low-frequency energy in the same windows), (iii) SHAP alignment (positive attribution concentrated in those exact time\u2013frequency tiles), and (iv) multiple near-identical labeled-3 reference examples, the classification as label 3 is robust and well supported.\\n\\nFinal per-label similarity scores (1\u20134) used to justify the decision:\\n- label_0: 2\\n- label_1: 2\\n- label_2: 3\\n- label_3: 4\\n- label_4: 1\\n- label_5: 1\\n- label_6: 2\\n\\nConclusion: The sample's dominant discriminative properties (sequence of low-frequency lobes, deep mid trough around t\u224848\u201354, strong late-mid positive pulse \u2248t=92\u2013106, terminal rise) match the label_3 (F-14 wings opened) pattern almost exactly; therefore the model should classify this sample as label 3 with high confidence. The returned score (4) denotes high similarity to that label's documented pattern.\"\n  ]\n}"

Overall volatility is low inside the main lobes and higher at the faster transition segments.\",\n    \"3) Temporal dependence & combination: the classifier\u2019s positive evidence is dominated by the centrally-timed, large, smooth hump; additional supportive evidence comes from smaller low-frequency rises later and to a lesser extent the initial baseline.

This indicates the classifier is using slow, large-scale waveform content in that mid-sequence window as positive evidence.\\n- Corresponding waveform window (t \u2248 52\u201378): In the raw time series this window contains the dominant, smoothly varying positive bulge that defines the sample. Precise characteristics:\\n  - Amplitude: the peak occurs near t \u2248 72 with an amplitude \u2248 +2.5\u2013+2.6 (the largest positive value in the whole trace). The base before the rise is near ~0 to +0.9, so the rise-to-peak is ~+1.6\u2013+1.8 above the preceding local level.\\n  - Time range: the main ascent begins around t \u2248 58\u201362 (values \u2248 +0.9), reaches the maximum at t \u2248 70\u201375, and the descent is visible by ~t \u2248 80\u201388. So the full bulge occupies roughly 15\u201325 time steps (approx t=60\u201385), with the most informative band (by SHAP) focused on the central 20 steps.\\n  - Trend & change rate: the rise into the peak is smooth and moderately steep: roughly +1.6 over ~12\u201314 steps (average slope \u2248 +0.11 to +0.14 units/step). The subsequent fall is somewhat faster (steeper negative slope) over fewer steps \u2014 an asymmetric shape (gradual rise, quicker fall).\\n  - Volatility / substructure: volatility inside the bulge is low \u2014 the trace is a single, clean convex hump without high-frequency wiggles. STFT for this time window shows concentrated energy at the very lowest frequency bins and little mid/high-frequency energy, matching the low-volatility observation.\\n  - Shape: a single, dominant broad convex peak (low-frequency, large-scale curvature), slightly asymmetric (rise slower than decline). This smooth bulge is the main positive driver identified by SHAP.\\n- Additional SHAP/red context: weaker low-frequency positive at very early times and weak positive toward the end (small low-frequency contributions) are present but far smaller in magnitude. The early trough (t\u224816\u201328) and the late trough (t\u2248110\u2013120) are visible in the time series but the strongest positive attribution remains the central broad peak.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series description, periodicity and relationships between features:\\n- Global shape and extrema:\\n  - Start: the series begins positive (~+1.3) and declines through a couple small inflections into a deep early trough around t \u2248 24\u201328 (minimum \u2248 -1.8 to -2.0).\\n  - Mid: a modest hump around t \u2248 36\u201344 (small positive rebound near 0 to +0.1), followed by the major mid bulge described in Step 1 (peak near t \u2248 70 at \u2248 +2.6).\\n  - Later: after the major peak the series drops into a negative interval (troughs near t \u2248 92\u2013104 around -0.9 to -1.0, then a deeper trough near t \u2248 116 at \u2248 -1.8), then recovers with a steady final rise to the end value (~+1.3 at t=143).\\n- Periodicity / frequency content: The sequence is dominated by slow, quasi-periodic undulations (broad peaks/troughs spaced ~40\u201350 time steps apart). STFT across the series shows most energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins; mid/high frequencies have low power except for small localized transitions. This confirms the sample is a low-frequency dominated waveform.\\n- Volatility & local transients: Most of the series is low-volatility within each large-scale lobe; sharper transitions (more mid-frequency energy) appear in a few descent/ascent flanks (e.g., the fall right after the main peak and the late recovered rise), but these are relatively small in power compared to the main low-frequency components. SHAP shows negative (blue) at some mid-frequency rows where slightly sharper transitions occur, meaning those faster components slightly reduce confidence for the positive class feature but do not override the dominant low-frequency peak.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: The classifier appears to combine multiple large-scale features in order: an initial high\u2192deep trough, a small mid rebound, the dominant broad mid bulge (most decisive), and a later deep trough followed by final rise. The mid bulge's timing and amplitude are the principal evidence, with earlier and later lobes acting as supporting context.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature summaries and preliminary label selection:\\n- Compare to label summaries:\\n  - Label 4 (Harrier) summary specifically calls out a strong low-frequency, large-amplitude rising bump between roughly t\u224852\u201371 with a peak \u2248+2.6, preceded by a shallow valley and followed by a descent into another valley and a later recovery. It emphasizes a single dominant asymmetric central hump (slow rise, quicker fall), low-frequency dominance in STFT, and concentrated positive SHAP at the mid time window. This is an almost exact match to the sample features above.\\n  - Other labels (0,1,2,3,5,6) also emphasize low-frequency features in some windows, but their prototypical patterns differ in detail: some have different mid-window phasing (e.g., label 1 has a two-hump mid-cycle pattern with a smaller hump earlier), or more/less prominent trough emphasis (labels 2 and 3), or different amplitude/time centering (label 5\u2019s primary hump tends to be earlier and lower amplitude; label 6 emphasizes a persistent low-frequency envelope plus sharper transitions that are penalized). The best feature-level and timing concordance is with label 4.\\n- Preliminary classification: Label 4 (Harrier) is the best match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with the provided reference examples and finalize similarity scores:\\n- The four given 'similar' reference plots are all labeled 4 and are visually and quantitatively extremely close to our test sample: they share (a) the deep early trough near t\u224825, (b) a small rebound in the 36\u201352 range, (c) the dominant mid-sequence bulge peaking near t\u224870 at \u2248+2.4\u2013+2.6, (d) a mid-late trough near 110\u2013120, and (e) a final rise to positive endpoint. Their STFTs and SHAP heatmaps also place strongest low-frequency, positive attribution in the same mid window. This strong confirmation from multiple training examples supports a high-confidence classification to label 4.\\n- Dissimilar samples (labels 3.0 shown) have different mid/early phasing and stronger alternating high-frequency texture in places; their SHAP maps emphasize different time-frequency regions. They do not match the defining mid bulge that we see here.\\n\\nFinal decision and similarity scoring (1\u20134) for each label (justification summarized):\\n- label 0 (Mirage): score 2. Some broad low-frequency lobes appear in common, but overall timing, amplitude and the single dominant mid bulge match only weakly with the Mirage descriptions \u2014 low similarity.\\n- label 1 (Eurofighter): score 3. Shared traits: mid-segment low-frequency energy and an asymmetric mid bulge are present in both; however Eurofighter descriptions emphasize a two-stage mid hump (smaller hump then larger hump) and different attribution of early/late rises which the sample only partially shows. Moderate similarity.\\n- label 2 (F-14 wings closed): score 2. While there are slow humps and troughs that could partially overlap with label-2 patterns, the precise mid bulge amplitude/timing and the overall shape here better match label 4 than label 2.\\n- label 3 (F-14 wings opened): score 1. The F-14(wings opened) patterns emphasize multiple separated negative lobes and different mid-window structure; the sample's dominant positive mid bulge is not consistent with the key label-3 signature.\\n- label 4 (Harrier): score 4. High similarity: the canonical Harrier description explicitly matches the strong low-frequency mid bulge (t\u224852\u201371, peak \u2248+2.6), the preceding trough and the later descent and recovery. The provided reference samples labeled 4 are nearly identical in waveform, STFT and SHAP attribution. This is the best and most specific match.\\n- label 5 (F-22): score 2. F-22 has mid-sequence positive hump(s) but usually of smaller amplitude and with different timing/substructure; partial but weak match.\\n- label 6 (F-15): score 2. Some broad, persistent low-frequency envelope aspects are shared, but the exact mid hump magnitude and asymmetric profile here more strongly indicate label 4.\\n\\nConclusion (final output):\\n- Predicted label: label 4 (Harrier).\\n- Confidence/score: 4 (high similarity to label 4 patterns and multiple near-identical training references).\"\n    ]\n}"

I therefore inspect the raw trace and STFT in that same mid-range.\\n- Mid-segment positive hump (primary discriminative event): Time range ~52 \u2192 ~78 (most intense 60\u201376). Raw amplitude: the signal rises from roughly +0.9 at ~60 to a sharp broad peak \u2248 +2.3 to +2.6 near ~72\u201376. Change rate: the ascent is relatively steady over ~12\u201316 steps, average slope \u2248 +0.10\u2013+0.20 units/step (faster near the final ascent portion). Volatility & shape: the hump is low-volatility (smooth monotonic rise into a single broad peak), then a somewhat faster descent after the peak (asymmetric: slower rise, quicker fall). STFT: strong energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins during this window, confirming the event is low-frequency / large-scale rather than a high-frequency spike.\\n- Supporting earlier trough (secondary positive context): Time range ~10\u201330 (not as strongly red but present). Raw amplitude: early descent from ~+1.3 at t\u22480 down to a deep trough \u2248 -1.8 around t\u224826. Shape: broad, smooth negative trough (low volatility inside trough). STFT: low-frequency energy aligned with the trough. This early trough provides contrast (valley \u2192 mid hump) that boosts the mid-hump\u2019s discriminative power in the model.\\n- Late trough & final rise (tertiary positive cues): Time range ~104\u2013125 (trough) then ~125\u2013143 (recovery). Raw amplitude: a deep late trough near t\u2248118 reaching \u2248 -1.8, followed by a fairly steep recovery to \u2248 +1.2\u2013+1.3 at the sequence end. The end rise is relatively quick compared with mid hump and shows low-frequency energy in STFT and light positive SHAP near the end. Volatility: the late trough-to-rise is steeper (higher instantaneous slope) and has slightly more short-scale variability during the transition, but its dominant energy is still at low frequency.\\n- Additional small substructure: there is a modest mid-small hump around t\u224836\u201344 (amplitude near 0 to +0.1) preceding the main mid hump; it is low magnitude and low SHAP compared with the main hump. Small high-frequency wiggles are present occasionally but STFT and SHAP show these are low-energy and neutral/weak in attribution.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and relationships between features:\\n- Dominant pattern: The series is a sequence of a large early descent (high positive \u2192 deep trough), a strong central broad positive hump (the main low-frequency bulge), a later deep trough, and a final rise to a positive endpoint. In other words: trough (early) \u2192 strong mid peak \u2192 trough (late) \u2192 final rise.\\n- Frequency content and volatility: STFT and SHAP agree that most discriminative energy lies in the very-low-frequency bins (bottom rows). Volatility within the main lobes is low (smooth ramps); transitions between lobes (especially the descent after the mid-peak and the late recovery) are steeper and slightly higher-frequency but still low-frequency dominant. High-frequency noise is minimal and not positively attributed.\\n- Temporal dependence: The ordering (early trough \u2192 mid hump \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise) is preserved and seems critical \u2014 the classifier\u2019s SHAP focuses on the mid window but also uses the surrounding troughs to confirm the shape. The mid hump is asymmetric (slower build, faster descent), which matches what the model treats as characteristic for some classes.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping these features to the provided label pattern summaries and initial label selection:\\n- Label 4 (Harrier) summary key points: strong low-frequency large mid-segment positive hump around ~52\u201371 with peak \u2248 +2.6; an early negative trough preceding it; a later descent and recovery; classifier emphasizes the mid hump at lowest frequencies. This aligns very closely with Sample 24: the timings, amplitudes (mid peak \u2248 +2.3\u20132.6), low-frequency dominance, early trough near t\u224826, and late trough+final rise are all present.\\n- Comparison to other labels (brief):\\n  \u2022 Label 0 (Mirage): also emphasizes low-frequency structure but the Mirage pattern often has multiple broad lobes with strongest positive attribution at times ~13\u201330 and 26\u201365 etc. Mirage mid-window emphasis is somewhat different in phasing and includes several broad undulations; Sample 24\u2019s dominant central single large hump fits Harrier more specifically.\\n  \u2022 Label 1 (Eurofighter): mid-segment low-frequency cycle is important but Eurofighter pattern often shows a smaller hump preceding a larger hump with distinct asymmetry and a mid-window zero crossing anchor; Sample 24 has a single dominant mid hump rather than the Eurofighter two-stage hump pattern.\\n  \u2022 Label 2 (F-14 closed), Label 3 (F-14 open), Label 5 (F-22), Label 6 (F-15): each have distinct timing/amplitude signatures described in the summaries; among them, labels 2/3 emphasize trough timing or negative-dominant patterns at different places; F-22/ F-15 mid-lobes are smaller or different in placement. None match as closely as label 4.\\n- Initial selection: label 4 is the best match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples (sanity check):\\n- All four \u2018similar\u2019 reference samples shown are labeled 4 and are visually and spectrally nearly identical to Sample 24: they show the same early drop to a trough (~t\u224826), a smooth moderate hump around ~36\u201344 then the dominant mid hump peaking \u224870\u201376 with amplitude \u2248+2.3\u20132.6, followed by a mid-late trough (~105\u2013120) and a final rise. Their STFTs display the same concentration of energy in the lowest-frequency rows during the mid window; their SHAP heatmaps also place strong red mass at the lowest-frequency bin in the mid window (\u224852\u201378). This close match confirms the model would treat Sample 24 the same way and strengthens the Harrier label assignment.\\n- The two \u2018dissimilar\u2019 references are label 3 (F-14 wings opened). Those have different global shapes (e.g., deeper/earlier troughs or different mid-lobe phasing and SHAP activation patterns) and show positive SHAP at somewhat different time segments; they do not match Sample 24 as well.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Quantified similarity reasoning and final decision:\\n- Given the near one-to-one correspondence of the primary discriminative event (mid-segment large low-frequency hump peaking \u2248+2.3\u20132.6 at ~70\u201376), the presence of the early trough (~t=26), the late trough and recovery, the matching STFT low-frequency concentration and identical SHAP localization, Sample 24 matches the label 4 (Harrier) pattern at a high level.\\n- I therefore assign final label: label 4 (Harrier) with similarity score 4 (high similarity).\\n\\n(Per-label quick similarity notes used during decision \u2014 integers 1..4):\\n- label 0 (Mirage): 2 (low similarity \u2014 some low-frequency features are shared but phasing/amplitude differs)\\n- label 1 (Eurofighter): 2 (low similarity \u2014 both emphasize mid-low-frequency but Eurofighter expects a two-hump asymmetry that is not present)\\n- label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 2 (low similarity \u2014 F-14 closed patterns emphasize trough timing differently)\\n- label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 1 (no similarity \u2014 dissimilar timing/shape and SHAP patterns)\\n- label 4 (Harrier): 4 (high similarity \u2014 near match in mid-peak timing, amplitude, STFT and SHAP)\\n- label 5 (F-22): 2 (low similarity \u2014 smaller mid-lobes and edge amplitude pattern differences)\\n- label 6 (F-15): 2 (low similarity \u2014 F-15 has repeated smooth envelope across a broader region which differs somewhat)\\n\\nConclusion: After detailed local feature analysis, global pattern assessment, and verification against reference samples and SHAP/STFT evidence, Sample 24 should be classified as label 4 (Harrier).\"\n  ]\n}",
      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 4\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local (red SHAP) feature description:\\n- SHAP highlights: concentrated positive (red) mass at the very-low-frequency rows (closest to 0 Hz) centered on the mid-sequence time window. The strongest red block maps roughly to time steps \u224850\u201380 (most intense around \u224860\u201378). There are weaker low-frequency positive patches elsewhere but the mid-window block is dominant.\\n- Corresponding time-series manifestation (fine-grained): the mid-window (\u224852\u201378) is a smooth, large-amplitude, single-peaked hump. Measured features: baseline at the start of the hump \u2248 +0.9 around t\u224860, rising to the peak \u2248 +2.4 to +2.6 at \u2248t=72\u201376 (net rise \u2248 +1.5). The rise is mostly smooth (low local volatility) spanning \u224812\u201320 steps (average slope ~ +0.08\u20130.15 units/step), with the ascent somewhat slower than the descent immediately after the peak (asymmetry: slower rise, somewhat quicker fall). STFT confirms concentrated energy in the lowest frequency bins during that same window (bright band at bottom rows) so the event is a genuine low-frequency/large-scale feature rather than high-frequency noise.\\n- Secondary positive contributors: small low-frequency support near the beginning (t\u22480\u20136) and at the very end (t\u2248130\u2013143) contribute modestly (smaller amplitude positive lobes); these are visible but much weaker in SHAP. Between the big mid hump and the end there is a deep trough around t\u224824\u201328 (min \u2248 -1.8 to -1.9) that precedes the mid hump \u2014 this trough shows some low-frequency attribution earlier but is not the strongest red region.\\n- Volatility/substructure: the positively attributed mid hump is low-volatility (smooth ramp, no rapid oscillations). STFT shows minimal high-frequency energy in the red window, consistent with SHAP focusing on low frequencies. The large positive SHAP values align with broad convex shape (single wide bulge) rather than multiple narrow spikes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and temporal relationships:\\n- Global pattern: sample 24 is dominated by a sequence of slow, large-scale undulations (low-frequency envelope) across 144 points: (1) an early decline from a positive start down to a deep trough near t\u224826 (\u2248 -1.8), (2) a modest small hump around t\u224836\u201344, (3) the dominant mid-sequence large hump centered \u224872\u201376 (+2.4 to +2.6), (4) a later descent to another deep trough around t\u2248116\u2013120 (\u2248 -1.8 to -1.9), and (5) a final recovery to positive values by t=143 (\u2248 +1.2\u2013+1.4).\\n- Periodicity & frequency content: energy is concentrated at very low frequencies (STFT bright band at bottom rows during the mid window and other large swings). There is quasi-periodic large-scale spacing of extrema (~40\u201350 time steps between major troughs/peaks). Within the big lobes volatility is low; transitions (rise/fall) can be steeper and introduce modest mid-frequency energy (visible as slightly broader low-frequency spread in STFT during transitions), but overall the series is smooth.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: the classifier appears to use the ordered combination trough (early) \u2192 large mid hump \u2192 trough (later) \u2192 final rise as a composite signature. The mid hump is the single most discriminative event (strongest SHAP). Smaller lobes (start/end) provide supportive evidence but are secondary.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label feature summaries (which label best matches?):\\n- Compare to label_4 (Harrier) summary: label_4 descriptions emphasize a dominant mid-segment large low-frequency positive bump around t\u224839\u201370 (trough\u2192big rise\u2192peak), asymmetric slow rise / quicker fall, preceding trough and later recovery. Sample 24 matches these key elements closely: strong central hump amplitude (~+2.4\u2013+2.6), low-frequency dominance in STFT, preceding deep trough at \u224826, later trough near \u2248118 and final recovery. The SHAP attribution pattern (very low-frequency positive in the mid window) is essentially the canonical Harrier signature described in label_4. => High similarity (score 4).\\n- Quick comparison to other labels (similarity scores and brief reasons):\\n  - label_0 (Mirage) = 2: also relies on low-frequency lobes, but Mirage summaries emphasize a different timing (strong positive at early and late edges and multiple specific low-frequency lobes at t\u224813\u201330, 48\u201356, 64\u201392). Sample 24 shares low-frequency multi-lobe structure but the dominant mid hump timing, shape and asymmetry better match Harrier than Mirage.\\n  - label_1 (Eurofighter) = 3: Eurofighter has a pronounced asymmetric mid-cycle (small hump then larger hump near \u224872 and faster fall). Sample 24 has a single dominant mid hump (not clearly the two-stage smaller hump + larger hump pattern), so moderate similarity but less exact than label_4.\\n  - label_2 (F-14 wings closed) = 2: label_2 emphasizes early steep fall into a trough and a later deep trough at \u2248104\u2013125; sample 24 has an early trough and later trough but the central large positive bulge and its precise timing/shape align more with Harrier, so only low similarity.\\n  - label_3 (F-14 wings opened) = 2: label_3 shows several separated low-frequency negative lobes and a late positive pulse; sample 24 contains both troughs and positive pulses but the strong mid positive hump and its shape are more consistent with Harrier than with the wings-open F-14 pattern.\\n  - label_5 (F-22) = 3: F-22 features a broad mid-sequence positive lobe (\u224836\u201370) but typically smaller amplitude and slightly different substructure; sample 24\u2019s mid hump is very similar in position but larger in amplitude and with the exact asymmetry described for Harrier, so moderate similarity.\\n  - label_6 (F-15) = 2: F-15 shows persistent low-frequency envelope and twin peaks; sample 24 has low-frequency envelope but the single dominant central hump timing and asymmetry match Harrier best.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Recheck vs. provided reference samples:\\n- The four provided similar reference samples (IDs 42, 92, 53, 84) are all labeled 4 and are visually almost the same as sample 24: same early decline to a trough ~t=26, similar small hump around 36\u201340, a strong central peak near t\u224872\u201376 with amplitude \u2248+2.4\u2013+2.6, then a descent and late trough \u2248118 and final rise. Their STFTs and SHAP heatmaps show the same concentrated low-frequency positive attribution in the mid window. This close match confirms the initial mapping to label_4 and supports the high-similarity assignment.\\n- The two dissimilar reference samples (IDs 17, 57 labeled 3) show different global shapes (different mid-lobe arrangements and somewhat different SHAP spatial patterns). They do not match sample 24 as closely, which further supports selecting label_4.\\n\\nFinal judgement: sample 24 best matches label_4 (Harrier). The mid-sequence, large-amplitude, low-frequency asymmetric hump (\u2248t=52\u201378, peak \u2248+2.4\u2013+2.6) together with the preceding trough at \u2248t=26 and later descent/ recovery are the decisive, highly matching features. I therefore output label_4 with a high similarity score (4).\"\n  ]\n}",

I therefore inspect the raw trace and STFT at that interval.\\n- Mid-window (primary red block, ~t=52\u201378): the trace shows a smooth, large-amplitude positive bulge. Measured roughly from the local valley just before this window (~t\u224850 at about -1.0) up to the main peak (~t\u224876 at \u2248+2.4\u2013+2.6) gives a rise of ~3.4\u20133.6 units over ~24 steps (average slope \u2248 +0.14\u2013+0.15 units/step). Volatility inside this rise and at the peak is low (no high-frequency jitter); STFT shows concentrated energy in the bottom frequency rows at these times, confirming the feature is a slow/low-frequency bulge. SHAP assigns strong positive weight to these lowest-frequency bands here, so this slow large hump is the main positive evidence for the model.\\n- Early segment (~t=0\u201330): the series begins positive (~+1.2 at t=0) and falls to a pronounced trough near t\u224825\u201328 (\u2248 -1.9 to -2.0). This is a wide, smooth negative excursion (low volatility inside trough). STFT shows low-frequency power there as well and SHAP contains weaker but clearly positive low-frequency attribution in the early drop/trough region \u2014 i.e., the model uses this early trough as supporting context.\\n- Mid-to-late trough (~t=100\u2013120): after the big mid-peak the series declines to another deep trough near t\u2248115\u2013120 (~-1.6 to -1.8) before recovering. This trough is broad and smooth; SHAP in the lowest frequency rows in neighboring windows is neutral-to-slightly negative for some mid frequencies but low-frequency SHAP near the trough is modestly positive/neutral. STFT again shows low-frequency energy associated with the trough.\\n- Final rise (t\u2248125\u2013143): the sequence climbs from the late trough back up to a positive endpoint (~+1.2 at t=143). This rise is relatively fast compared with the earlier slow bulge but is still dominated by low-frequency energy in STFT; SHAP shows small positive low-frequency contributions near the end.\\n- Additional frequency detail: STFT confirms that the dominant magnitudes for the highlighted positive SHAP windows are in the lowest frequency bins (bottom rows). There are brief mid-frequency increases during the steeper transitional slopes (e.g., decline right after the mid peak), and SHAP tends to give neutral-to-negative values to those mid-frequency bands \u2014 indicating the model discounts sharp high-frequency content while rewarding slow, large-scale lobes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and combination of features:\\n- Global shape: the trace is dominated by a small number of broad, low-frequency lobes: an initial positive level followed by a deep early trough (~t~25), then a smooth recovery and a dominant mid-sequence positive bulge peaking near ~t~75, then a decline into a late trough (~t~115), and finally a recovery to a positive endpoint. In short: trough (early) \u2192 large mid peak \u2192 trough (late) \u2192 final rise.\\n- Periodicity / frequency content: the pattern is quasi-periodic at a low fundamental frequency (STFT energy concentrated near 0 Hz); the main discriminative events are slow and wide (tens of time steps). High-frequency detail is minimal and not positively attributed.\\n- Volatility: within the main lobes volatility is low (smooth ramps); sharper slopes occur during transitions and align with increased mid-frequency STFT energy where SHAP is neutral or negative (model does not favor sharp edges).\\n- Temporal dependence: the order of these broad events matters \u2014 the early deep trough, then a later dominant mid bulge, followed by a late trough and final rise \u2014 the classifier appears to combine these temporally ordered low-frequency features additively when forming its decision (as indicated by multiple separated red low-frequency patches in SHAP).\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and selection:\\n- The extracted local and global features match very closely the label_4 (Harrier) description: label_4 emphasizes a pronounced mid-segment slow rising hump (peak near t\u224865\u201370 in the summary) preceded by an early trough (~t\u224816\u201326) and followed by a later trough and final recovery. The SHAP + STFT pattern described for label_4 is essentially the same (strong low-frequency positive attribution concentrated in the mid segment). The sample\u2019s mid hump amplitude (~+2.4\u2013+2.6), early trough (~-1.9 to -2.0), and late trough/recovery closely mirror the label_4 pattern.\\n- Comparing with other labels: other classes (e.g., labels 0,1,2,5,6) also rely on low-frequency features, but their characteristic temporal placements, asymmetries and shapes differ (for instance label_1 emphasizes mid-window two-lobe structure with earlier zero-crossing; label_2 and label_6 show different trough/peak timings and sequences). The sample\u2019s precise ordering and amplitude proportions map most directly to the label_4 pattern.\\n- Therefore the best matching label is label 4 (Harrier). I give a high similarity score of 4 (high similarity) because both the detailed local events (timing, amplitude, slope, low volatility) and the SHAP + STFT attribution strongly align with the reference description for label_4.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples:\\n- The four similar reference samples (Samples 42, 44, 84, 53) labeled 4 display extremely similar traces: early drop to a deep trough around t\u224826, a moderate hump around t\u224840, then a dominant mid-sequence peak near t\u224875 (\u2248+2.4\u2013+2.6), a trough near t\u2248115\u2013120, and final recovery to a positive endpoint. Their STFTs show the same low-frequency concentration in the mid window and their SHAP heatmaps show the same strong red low-frequency block around the mid-segment. The test sample reproduces these elements nearly identically.\\n- The two dissimilar reference samples (labels 3) show notably different temporal structure (different timing of large lobes, different SHAP mid-frequency attributions), so they are not good matches.\\n- There is therefore strong consistency between the sample\u2019s features, the label_4 feature summary, and the label_4 reference examples. The scoring logic (4 = high similarity) is fair: the match is near one-to-one in event timing, amplitude, frequency content and SHAP attribution.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 4 (Harrier) with similarity score = 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

The STFT confirms strong energy in the very-low-frequency band over the same interval. This tells us the model is relying on a broad, slow component in that mid-segment.\\n- Corresponding time-series manifestation (precise local description): a large, smooth positive bulge centered near t\u224875. Measured features: peak amplitude \u2248 +2.3\u2026+2.6 at \u224875\u201378; the rising flank begins near \u224860 (\u2248+0.8) and the fall back through zero completes by \u224895 (\u2248-0.9 to -1.1). Local volatility inside the bulge is low (no high-frequency spikes), the rise is relatively steady then accelerates to the peak, and the descent is somewhat faster (asymmetric shape: slower build, sharper drop). Estimated mean slope on the main ascent \u2248 +0.12\u2013+0.18 units/time-step, descent slope larger in magnitude.\\n- Other local features outside the main red block used by the model: an early deep trough around t\u224824\u201328 (min \u2248 -1.9 to -2.0) preceded by a moderate positive start (~+1.2 at t=0) and a late deep trough near t\u2248116\u2013120 (min \u2248 -1.7) followed by a final recovery to \u2248+1.2 at the end. The SHAP map shows weaker positive low-frequency contribution at endpoints but the dominant positive evidence is the mid-segment bulge.\\n- Frequency corroboration: STFT has strongest magnitude at the bottom frequency rows during the mid-window and much weaker mid-to-high frequency energy overall, confirming the SHAP low-frequency attribution. Small higher-frequency oscillations (visible briefly around t\u2248100) correspond to neutral/slightly negative SHAP and low STFT power in higher rows.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and dependencies:\\n- Global shape: the series is dominated by a small number of large, low-frequency lobes (early high \u2192 deep early trough at ~25 \u2192 mid large positive bulge ~75 \u2192 late trough ~118 \u2192 final rise). This gives quasi-periodic, slow undulations rather than rapid oscillations.\\n- Volatility: low within the broad lobes; steeper transitions (higher instantaneous slope) occur at the boundaries of lobes (notably descent after the mid-peak and the late recovery). Higher-frequency micro-variations are minimal and not emphasized by SHAP.\\n- Temporal dependence & ordering: the sequence of features matters \u2014 an early trough followed by a pronounced mid positive bulge, then a late trough and final recovery. The classifier\u2019s positive attribution concentrates on the mid bulge, indicating that presence, amplitude and timing of that bulge relative to earlier trough are key discriminants.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature patterns (selection & scoring rationale):\\n- Label 4 (Harrier): The label-4 summary and the four similar reference samples show a strongly matching signature: dominant mid-segment large positive hump centered ~t\u224852\u201371 with peak \u2248+2.6, preceded by an early trough and followed by a late trough and recovery. Aspects matching: (1) timing of main hump (mid-sequence), (2) amplitude of hump (~+2.3\u2013+2.6), (3) low-frequency dominance and low volatility within the hump, (4) asymmetric slow rise / faster fall. The provided reference samples (Samples 42,44,84,53) are visually almost identical to the test sample in waveform and STFT/SHAP patterns. Therefore high similarity -> score 4.\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): Also shows mid-segment low-frequency energy and a major hump near ~72\u201378 in its summary. Differences: Eurofighter descriptions emphasize an asymmetric mid cycle often with a preceding zero crossing and sometimes less extreme absolute peak amplitude; SHAP for Eurofighter often discounts late endpoint rises. Our sample has the exact large amplitude mid bulge and endpoint behavior more consistent with Harrier. Similarity moderate-to-high but not as precise as label 4 -> score 3 (not chosen).\\n- Label 5 (F-22): F-22 has mid lobes but typically smaller primary hump amplitude (~+0.6\u2013+0.8 in examples) and stronger emphasis on a peak nearer t\u224855; our sample\u2019s hump amplitude is substantially larger and matches Harrier\u2019s main hump amplitude. Similarity low-to-moderate -> score 2.\\n- Labels 0,2,3,6 (Mirage, F-14 closed, F-14 opened, F-15): these classes share low-frequency components across samples, but each has distinct multi-lobe timing or penalizes faster transitions differently. While our sample contains some features (early trough, multiple lobes) that appear in these summaries, their prototypical patterns (timing, amplitude, or presence of multiple separated strong troughs instead of a single dominant mid hump) do not align as closely. Similarity low -> score 1 for each of these labels.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four reference samples labeled 4 are near-identical in overall waveform (early moderate positive, deep trough near 25\u201328, smooth mid hump peaking ~70\u201378 at ~+2.5, subsequent trough ~115\u2013120, final rise) and their SHAP heatmaps concentrate positive attribution in the same lowest-frequency rows during the same mid window. The test sample\u2019s STFT and SHAP align tightly with those references.\\n- The dissimilar samples (labels 3 in provided dissimilar set) show different mid/late structure (different phasing of lobes, different SHAP distribution), reinforcing that label 4 references are the best match.\\n- The model explanation (SHAP) directly pinpoints the same mid low-frequency bulge used by label-4 summary as primary evidence; amplitude, timing and asymmetry match very closely. No contradictory evidence in STFT or SHAP suggests a different label.\\n\\nConclusion (final decision): label 4 (Harrier) is the best match. Rationale: near-perfect alignment of the dominant mid-segment, low-frequency, large-amplitude asymmetric hump (timing, amplitude, low volatility), the presence of early and late troughs in the same relative positions, and the identical SHAP/STFT localization all match the Harrier pattern and the four provided label-4 reference samples.

The STFT shows large energy in the bottom rows over the same mid window, confirming these events are low-frequency/long-wavelength features.\\n- Corresponding time-series manifestation (fine-grained):\\n  * Early trough: t\u224820\u201330, the trace reaches a deep negative trough near t\u224826 with amplitude \u2248 -2.0. This is a wide, smooth valley (low local volatility inside the trough) produced by a gradual descent from the early positive baseline (t=0 ~ +1.2) to the trough (change \u2248 -3.2 over \u224825 steps, relatively steep compared with later ramps).\\n  * Mid-to-dominant rise (main red-attributed region): from about t\u224852 (local valley \u2248 -0.9) the signal rises smoothly through t\u224865 (\u2248+0.95) to a pronounced peak at t\u224872\u201378 (peak \u2248 +2.4 to +2.6). The rise from \u2248-0.9 (t\u224852) to \u2248+0.95 (t\u224865) is \u2248+1.85 over \u224813 steps (avg slope \u2248 +0.14 per step). The further rise to the main peak (\u2248+1.55 over 10 steps) has a similar moderate slope (~+0.15 per step). Volatility during the rise is low (smooth ramp), and no substantial high-frequency spikes appear in STFT for this interval; energy concentrates at the lowest frequencies as SHAP indicates.\\n  * Mid-peak shape & asymmetry: the dominant hump is broad and asymmetric \u2014 a somewhat gradual rise into the peak and a slightly faster descent afterward (the down-slope after the peak is steeper than the up-slope), matching the SHAP emphasis on the low-frequency band during the ascent/peak.\\n  * Later trough and recovery: after the descent from the main peak there is another negative region roughly around t\u2248110\u2013120 (a broad trough near \u2248 -1.8 to -1.9), then a final smooth recovery and rise toward the end (t\u2248130\u2013143) reaching positive values \u2248 +1.2 at the series end. The final rise contains low-frequency energy (STFT bottom rows) and light positive SHAP at low frequency.\\n- Frequency detail: STFT confirms the mid-window events are dominated by the very lowest frequency bins; higher-frequency rows show minimal energy during the main hump (consistent with SHAP positive attribution being concentrated at the bottom frequency rows). Localized higher-frequency activity is negligible in the main red region, so the classifier is reacting to broad contour-scale structure rather than short spikes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall feature summary and temporal dependence:\\n- Overall trend & periodicity: the series shows a slow quasi-periodic low-frequency envelope with 2\u20133 broad lobes across 144 points: (1) early descent to a deep trough (~0\u201330), (2) mid positive bulge culminating in a strong peak (~52\u201378), (3) later descent to trough (~100\u2013120) and final recovery (~130\u2013143). These are long-wavelength events (~tens of steps apart), not fast oscillations.\\n- Volatility: low within the large lobes (smooth ramps), higher during transitions between lobes (moderate slopes). There are a few small high-frequency wiggles but they have low amplitude and STFT power and negligible SHAP attribution.\\n- Combination / temporal dependence: the classifier\u2019s SHAP explains the decision by summing positive contributions from separated low-frequency bulges (notably the central dominant hump and supportive early trough / final recovery). The timing/order matters \u2014 the early trough followed by the mid hump and later trough + final rise form a distinctive sequence (valley \u2192 big hump \u2192 valley \u2192 rise) the model recognizes. The mid hump is the single strongest positive cue; additional low-frequency support from the final rise strengthens the label evidence.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature summaries (initial scoring):\\n- Label 4 (Harrier): The reference pattern for label 4 emphasizes a dominant mid-segment large positive hump (t\u224839\u201371 or similar), a preceding trough and later recovery, low-frequency dominance and asymmetric slow rise with a somewhat faster fall. The test sample matches this very closely: same central strong low-frequency hump around t\u224865\u201378 reaching \u2248+2.4\u20132.6, earlier deep trough near t\u224826, and a later trough + recovery; STFT + SHAP patterns align (strong red at lowest frequencies in mid-window). Therefore match = High (score 4).\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): label 1 has a strong mid-segment low-frequency oscillation (small hump near ~50 then larger hump ~72 then faster fall). Our sample shares the two-stage mid-structure (smaller pre-hump then larger hump) and low-frequency emphasis, so moderate similarity exists. However Eurofighter references emphasize a particular asymmetric mid-cycle and de-emphasize late rises; our sample has a stronger singular central hump and a clear late recovery that the Eurofighter pattern did not consistently weight. Match = Moderate (score 3).\\n- Label 0 (Mirage): Mirage patterns focus on several low-frequency lobes including mid and late wide peaks/troughs; some elements overlap (low-frequency lobes, final rise). But Mirage examples emphasize multiple broad lobes across different windows (and penalize mid/high-frequency content). While our sample shares low-frequency dominance, the specific central hump amplitude/shape and the particular ordering match label 4 better than Mirage. Match = Moderate (score 3).\\n- Labels 2 & 3 (F-14 closed / opened): Both F-14 variants often show pronounced troughs and repeated low-frequency events, but their reference SHAP patterns and waveform shapes place stronger positive attribution on different time windows (e.g., multiple significant troughs and different relative timings) than the mid-dominant positive hump in this sample. The F-14 patterns also sometimes show more separated trough emphasis. Our sample has some overlapping features (troughs present) but the central large positive hump is less characteristic of F-14 references. Match = Low (score 2 for label 2, score 2 for label 3).\\n- Label 5 (F-22): F-22 references show broad low-frequency lobes too, but usually the primary mid hump is smaller in amplitude and the pattern of supporting lobes differs (F-22 examples had a less extreme central peak and different edge behavior). Our sample's very pronounced mid peak and the precise trough\u2013peak ordering fit Harrier better than F-22. Match = Low\u2013Moderate (score 2).\\n- Label 6 (F-15): F-15 description highlights a persistent low-frequency envelope across a wide middle band with occasional sharper transitions that are penalized. Our sample has strong low-frequency events but a very pronounced isolated mid hump (and less persistent envelope across the whole middle) so it is not as close as label 4. Match = Low\u2013Moderate (score 2).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with the provided reference examples (verification):\\n- The four similar reference samples shown (Samples 42, 92, 84, 66) are all labelled 4 and are visually almost identical to test Sample 30: same early decline to trough near t\u224826, same small mid pre-hump around 40\u201352, same dominant central peak around 65\u201378 with amplitude ~+2.4\u20132.6, same later trough and recovery. Their STFT panels also concentrate energy in the bottom frequency rows at the mid window exactly as for the test sample; their SHAP heatmaps highlight the same low-frequency mid-window rows in red. This is strong confirmation that the classifier learned and applies the Harrier signature in this temporal/frequency region.\\n- The two dissimilar references (Samples 67 and 17, labelled 3) differ substantially: they show multiple small higher-frequency oscillations in mid-to-late sections, different relative positions of peaks and troughs, and their SHAP maps emphasize different low-frequency time windows (and display greater spread of positive attribution across early windows). These differences reduce the plausibility of Label 3 for the test sample. This supports the earlier scoring that label 4 is the best match.\\n- Fairness & scoring consistency check: the scoring logic gives highest weight to (a) precise timing of the dominant hump, (b) amplitude and asymmetry of that hump, (c) concordant STFT low-frequency energy at same times, and (d) SHAP low-frequency attribution in the same time band. The reference label-4 examples match all four criteria, while other labels either lack the central hump magnitude or show different ordering/SHAP emphasis. Thus assigning label 4 with a high similarity score (4) is consistent and justified.\\n\\nFinal classification decision: label 4 (Harrier), similarity score = 4 (high similarity). The test sample's dominant mid-segment low-frequency hump (t\u224852\u201378, peak \u2248 +2.4\u20132.6), preceding deep trough (~t26), and later trough+final recovery \u2014 together with STFT low-frequency energy and SHAP positive attribution concentrated in the same mid-window lowest-frequency rows \u2014 closely match the label-4 patterns and the provided label-4 reference examples.\"\n  ]\n}"

      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 4\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local feature description (focus on red SHAP region):\\n- SHAP shows the strongest positive attribution concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows (near 0 Hz) between roughly time steps ~52 and ~78, with positive contributions extending across ~39\u201391. I therefore inspect the raw trace and STFT in that interval.\\n- Time-range & amplitude: From ~52 to ~78 the series moves from a local negative value (~-1.1 at ~52) through a smooth monotonic rise to a pronounced peak (~+2.5 at ~74\u201376). Peak-to-trough magnitude in this block is about 3.6 units (approx -1.1 \u2192 +2.5).\\n- Trend & change rate: The rising portion is largely low-volatility and sustained: the average slope from ~52 to ~74 is roughly +0.20\u2013+0.25 units per time step (a clear, dominant upward ramp). Immediately after the peak there is a faster downward phase (peak -> descent to near 0 by ~92) with a larger instantaneous negative slope than the rising flank.\\n- Volatility & substructure: Within the ~52\u201378 window the signal is smooth (very low high-frequency jitter). There are no sharp spikes or high-frequency oscillations superimposed on this hump. STFT for the same time window shows concentrated energy in the bottom frequency bins, confirming the hump is a low-frequency (broad) feature.\\n- Shape and significance: The mid-sequence event is a large, asymmetric broad hump (slow/clean rise, somewhat faster fall) that aligns exactly with the strongest positive SHAP attribution. This indicates the classifier treats this low-frequency bulge as the primary evidence pushing the decision toward the associated class.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and feature combination:\\n- Global structure: The time series contains several large-scale low-frequency lobes across the 144 points: an early decline to a deep trough (~0\u2192~25), a recovery and small hump around ~36\u201340, the dominant mid hump at ~52\u201378 (described above), a subsequent descent to a trough around ~92\u2013100, a deeper trough near ~118\u2013122, and a final strong low-frequency rise to a positive endpoint by 143.\\n- Frequency content: STFT shows most energy concentrated at the very lowest frequencies, especially through the mid window (approx 39\u2013104). Higher frequency bands are low-power overall; small higher-frequency wiggles appear between larger events but carry little energy and are not SHAP-highlighted.\\n- Volatility & asymmetry: Large events are smooth and low-volatility; transitions (especially the descent after the mid-peak and the later trough-to-end rise) are relatively steeper. The mid hump is asymmetric (gradual build-up, quicker fall), matching a repeated pattern in the reference Harrier examples.\\n- Temporal dependence: The classifier appears to combine multiple separated low-frequency lobes additively: early trough(s) provide context, the mid-sequence broad hump supplies the strongest positive evidence, and the final rise is additional supporting evidence. The ordering (early trough \u2192 mid hump \u2192 later trough \u2192 terminal rise) is consistent and important for classification.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label patterns (which label best fits?):\\n- The provided label-4 (Harrier) summary explicitly lists a dominant mid-segment low-frequency large-amplitude hump between approx t\u224839\u201370 (peak ~2.6) preceded by a trough (~t\u224816\u201326) and followed by another trough and a late recovery. It emphasizes: (1) a trough\u2192large mid hump centered ~52\u201371, (2) strong low-frequency energy, (3) asymmetry (slow rise / faster fall). These points align strongly with the test sample: the test has an early trough near 25, a dominant mid hump ~52\u201376 reaching ~+2.5, a later trough around 104\u2013120, and late recovery to a positive endpoint.\\n- Other labels (0 Mirage, 1 Eurofighter, 2 F-14 wings-closed, 3 F-14 wings-open, 5 F-22, 6 F-15) also rely on low-frequency components in places, but their characteristic timing/shape patterns differ: e.g., Mirage and F-14 variants emphasize other time windows (early or multiple different lobes) or different asymmetries; Eurofighter has a two-lobe mid pattern (smaller then larger hump) but the Harrier description and the provided reference plots match the single dominant mid hump and timing seen here.\\n- Based on the strong alignment in timing, amplitude, low-frequency dominance and asymmetry with the label-4 description and the near-identical appearance of multiple provided reference samples marked as label 4, label 4 is the best match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final decision justification:\\n- The four provided \\\"similar\\\" reference examples are all labeled 4 and their raw traces, STFTs and SHAP maps show a nearly identical signature: a large, dominant mid-segment low-frequency hump (~52\u201378) with strong SHAP positive attribution in the lowest-frequency rows, earlier trough around ~25, and late trough + recovery. The test sample is visually and spectrally almost the same as those references.\\n- The two dissimilar examples (both label 3) show different global shapes: they emphasize different timing of peaks/troughs and more pronounced intermediate high-frequency substructure in places. Their SHAP maps also highlight different time windows. This further supports that the test sample is not best described by label 3.\\n- Similarity scoring: given the near one-to-one correspondence of the test sample's key discriminative features (dominant mid low-frequency hump timing/amplitude/asymmetry, preceding trough, low volatility within hump, STFT low-frequency energy, SHAP alignment) with the label-4 pattern and with the provided label-4 reference samples, I assign the highest similarity (score = 4) to label 4.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 4 (Harrier), similarity score 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

Immediately prior to the bulge the series shows a deeper trough around t\u224822\u201328 (\u2248 -1.8 to -2.0) and a modest local hump near t\u224836\u201340; after the main bulge the series falls to another trough around t\u2248115\u2013120 (\u2248 -1.7) and then recovers toward the end.

Change rates differ by segment: large but smooth rises (moderate slope) and somewhat faster descents (steeper negative slopes) after peaks. Local high-frequency noise is minimal and carries little spectral energy or SHAP importance.\",\n    \"3) Temporal dependence / composition: The sequence of events matters \u2014 an early trough \u2192 mid large hump \u2192 late trough \u2192 end rise forms a temporal signature. The classifier\u2019s SHAP attribution confirms it weights the mid bulge most strongly (the red block).

That description matches the test sample very closely: same mid-window low-frequency large-amplitude hump, similar timings and magnitudes, early trough and later trough/ recovery pattern.\",\n    \"2) Candidate labels: Several labels (0,1,2,5,6) also use low-frequency lobes as discriminative features, but Harrier\u2019s description specifically calls out a single dominant mid-window hump with the same timing/amplitude characteristics. The test sample\u2019s strongest SHAP and STFT energy is exactly on that mid hump.\",\n    \"3) Final classification choice: label 4 (Harrier) best matches the sample pattern (highest agreement in timing, amplitude, asymmetry, and SHAP attribution).

The STFT confirms elevated energy at the very lowest frequency bins over that same interval (i.e., the event is a slow/low-frequency feature). Mapping to the trace: this corresponds to a large, smooth positive hump that begins from slightly negative/near-zero values near t\u224852, rises monotonically and steeply to a prominent peak at roughly t\u224870\u201375 (peak amplitude \u2248 +2.4 to +2.6), then declines again after the peak. Quantitative/shape details: amplitude change from about -0.9\u20130.0 up to \u2248+2.5 (\u0394 \u2248 2.4\u20133.5), average ascent slope on the main rising flank \u2248 +0.15\u2013+0.25 units per time-step (faster near the end of the rise), very low local volatility inside the hump (no high-frequency jitter), and the shape is a broad, asymmetric convex peak (slower rise then somewhat faster fall).\\n\\n- Secondary positively-attributed low-frequency support: Small positive SHAP also appears at the lowest frequencies near the sequence start (t\u22480\u201312) and weak positive at the very end (t\u2248130\u2013143). On the plot the series begins at a positive level (\u2248+1.2 at t=0) and then falls; the end segment shows a renewed positive climb from \u2248 -1.7 (around 118) up to \u2248+1.2 by t=143. STFT shows low-frequency energy at sequence edges as well; SHAP positive mass there is smaller than the central hump but supportive.\\n\\n- Negative / neutral frequency bands: Mid-frequency rows around several time windows are neutral-to-slight-blue in SHAP (weak negative). These align with sharper transitions (e.g., the drop into the early trough near t\u224820\u201328 and the fall after the central peak) where STFT shows a little more mid-frequency content. Interpretation: sharper, quicker changes slightly detract from the label score while broad, slow lobes strongly support it.\\n\\n- Other local features visible in the waveform (and how they contribute):\\n  - Early descent: from t\u22488\u201326 the series falls from \u2248+0.9 down to a deep trough near t\u224824\u201328 (minimum \u2248 -1.8 to -2.0). This trough is broad and low-frequency (SHAP low-frequency rows show some positive attribution there as well, weaker than the central hump). The descent is relatively smooth; slope magnitude is moderate to high (\u2248 -0.15 to -0.22 per step).\\n  - Small mid-plateau / small hump around t\u224836\u201344: A modest recovery from the early trough up to a small positive bump around t\u224838\u201340 (\u2248 0.0 to +0.1) before falling slightly again \u2014 low amplitude and low-frequency.\\n  - Late-mid trough then recovery: after the central peak the trace declines through t\u224892\u2013118 to another deep trough near \u2248 -1.8 around t\u2248118, then a strong final rise from ~118 to 143 finishing positive. SHAP treats the final rise as weakly supportive (low-frequency positive) but the trough in 92\u2013118 can reduce confidence if not paired with the central hump.\\n\\nSummary of Task 1: The key discriminative event (the SHAP red block) is the broad, low-frequency, high-amplitude mid-sequence hump centered \u2248 t=70 with peak \u2248 +2.4\u20132.6, low volatility inside the hump, asymmetric rise/fall (rise slower \u2192 fall somewhat faster), and strongly concentrated energy in the lowest STFT bins. Secondary supporting low-frequency features are the early positive baseline and the final recovery; sharper transitions and mid-frequency content are neutral or slightly negative for class support.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal dependence:\\n- Global structure and periodicity: The sample is dominated by a small number (2\u20133) of large, slow oscillations (low-frequency components) across the 144 points rather than many fast cycles. Main global lobes appear early (positive start \u2192 deep trough around t\u224824\u201328), central (large positive hump centered t\u224870), and late (deep trough around t\u2248110\u2013118 then final rise to the end). STFT shows most power in the lowest frequency rows during the central and edge windows, confirming dominance of broad-scale contour features.\\n- Volatility: Volatility is heterogeneous \u2014 low volatility (smooth ramps) inside the main lobes, and moderate-to-higher slopes during transitions (especially the early fall into the first trough and the rise into the central hump). There are no significant high-frequency spikes; small local wiggles are low amplitude and carry little SHAP weight.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: The classifier appears to combine multiple separated low-frequency events additively (SHAP red masses in multiple windows). The central low-frequency hump is the strongest single positive contributor; the early trough and final rise act as reinforcing context features when present in the learned temporal order. The sequence/order (early trough \u2192 mid large hump \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise) matches a composite contour signature rather than isolated peaks.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Comparison to label feature summaries and initial label choice:\\n- Which label summary best matches the sample? The Harrier (label 4) summary explicitly describes a dominant mid-segment, large-amplitude low-frequency rising bump (trough \u2192 big rise up to \u2248 +2.6 around t\u224852\u201371), preceded by an early trough and followed by a descent and later recovery \u2014 and emphasizes that the classifier strongly attributes highest SHAP to that mid-window low-frequency hump. That description matches the test sample's morphology, timing, amplitude and SHAP activation nearly exactly.\\n- Preliminary classification: label 4 (Harrier).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference examples and assign per-label similarity scores (1\u20134):\\nI inspected the provided reference samples. Four 'similar' references are all labeled 4 and their waveforms, STFTs and SHAPs are nearly identical to the test sample: same early positive start then deep early trough at ~25, a strong smooth mid-segment hump centered around t\u224865\u201375 with peak \u2248 +2.4\u20132.6, neutral-to-negative SHAP at mid frequencies, and a late trough then final rise. The SHAP patterns also concentrate strongly in the lowest-frequency rows at the same mid time window. Dissimilar references (both labeled 3 in the examples) show different mid-sequence patterns (different phasing and stronger low-frequency positive mass at different windows or different local microstructure). Based on these checks, the Harrier match is very strong.\\n\\nPer-label similarity quantification (1\u20134):\\n- label 0 (Mirage): 3 (moderate). Mirage summaries emphasize low-frequency multi-lobe shapes as well, and some Mirage examples show mid-sequence low-frequency energy \u2014 but the characteristic timing and the specific dominant central hump amplitude/asymmetry of the test sample match Harrier more closely than Mirage.\\n- label 1 (Eurofighter): 2 (low). Eurofighter descriptions emphasize an asymmetric mid-cycle but with somewhat different ordering (smaller hump then larger hump pattern and neutral/negative attribution at sequence edges). The test sample's single dominant central hump and edge patterns fit less well.\\n- label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 2 (low). F-14 closed shows multi-stage trough/hump patterns but with different timing emphasis and multiple deep trough blocks; the test sample shares only some trough/hump features but the mid-segment dominant hump and SHAP concentration timing differ.\\n- label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 2 (low). F-14 opened has separated negative lobes and positive pulses but the detailed phasing/shape differs; provided dissimilar references for label 3 also differ visibly from the test sample.\\n- label 4 (Harrier): 4 (high). The test sample matches the Harrier reference descriptions and the four Harrier reference examples almost identically in waveform shape, timing of the central huge low-frequency hump (\u2248t=52\u201378), amplitude (peak \u2248 +2.4\u20132.6), and SHAP concentration on the lowest-frequency bins. This is the best match.\\n- label 5 (F-22): 2 (low). F-22 examples emphasize a different mid-lobe amplitude/timing profile (smaller mid hump around ~36\u201370 and repeated smaller lobes). The test sample's very large central hump is unlike typical F-22 patterns.\\n- label 6 (F-15): 2 (low). F-15 has a broad low-frequency envelope across a longer middle window and sometimes twin smaller peaks; although superficially similar in low-frequency dominance, the test sample's prominent single central hump and its exact timing/amplitude match Harrier closer than F-15.\\n\\nFinal verification against the four provided similar references labelled 4: each of those four reference plots (Samples 76, 44, 42, 53 in the references) overlays the same major features as the test sample \u2014 nearly identical central hump timing, amplitude and SHAP bottom-row concentration. The two dissimilar references (label 3) show different SHAP timing and different mid-segment shapes. Thus the classification as label 4 is consistent with both the feature summary for Harrier and the reference examples.\\n\\nConclusion: The model explanation (SHAP) and STFT align with a dominant low-frequency mid-segment hump (\u2248t=52\u201378) that is exactly the discriminative feature described for label 4 (Harrier). After detailed local feature analysis, global pattern comparison and cross-check against reference samples, the most accurate classification for Test Sample 53 is label 4 (Harrier). The match is high: score = 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

I therefore inspect the raw trace and STFT at those times. \\n- Time window ~52\u201378 (primary red region): the trace exhibits a smooth, large-amplitude upward bulge. Quantitatively: the signal rises from about -0.9 at t\u224852 to a clear peak near +2.3\u2013+2.4 around t\u224872\u201376. The net change is \u2248+3.1 to +3.3 over ~20\u201324 steps (average slope \u2248 +0.13 to +0.16 units/step, locally a little larger on the final ascent). Volatility inside this interval is low \u2014 the curve is smooth and single-peaked (no high-frequency jitter). STFT shows elevated energy concentrated at the very lowest frequency bins during this interval, confirming the feature is a slow (low\u2011frequency), broad hump. This slow large positive hump is precisely the portion driving positive SHAP attribution.\\n- Surrounding structure that reinforces this hump (also relevant because SHAP extends mildly earlier/later): preceding the hump there is a modest negative plateau around t\u224838\u201352 (values \u2248 -0.2 to -0.9) forming a clear trough\u2192peak contrast that increases low-frequency energy. After the peak (t\u224878\u201395) the trace falls smoothly back through zero into a moderate negative region (~-0.8 to -1.0) before a deeper trough later. These adjacent smooth transitions are low-volatility and low-frequency (STFT confirmation).\\n- Other notable local features (contextual but less strongly SHAP-positive): an early deep trough near t\u224826 (~-1.9) created by a prior steep decline from the start, and a deep late trough near t\u2248116\u2013118 (~-1.8) followed by a fast recovery to a positive endpoint (~+1.25 at t=143). These are larger-scale lobes (low-frequency) but the central mid hump (\u224852\u201378) has the strongest positive SHAP mass.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall feature summary and time-dependence:\\n- Overall trend & periodicity: the series is dominated by a small number (2\u20133) of broad, low-frequency undulations across the 144 points: (1) an early descent to a deep trough around t\u224826, (2) a dominant mid-sequence broad hump peaking \u224872\u201376, (3) a mid/late negative trough cluster around t\u224892\u2013118, and (4) a final recovery to a positive endpoint. These are long-wavelength cycles (STFT energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins). There is no rapid periodic oscillation\u2014rather quasi-periodic, widely spaced lobes.\\n- Volatility & change rates: volatility is generally low within lobes (smooth rises and falls). The steepest local slopes occur on transitions into/out-of the big troughs/peaks (e.g., the early drop into the t\u224826 trough and the final rise after t\u2248118). The mid hump rise is relatively smooth but moderately brisk (average slope \u2248 +0.13\u2013+0.16), and its fall is somewhat quicker in places \u2014 a mild asymmetry.\\n- Combination and temporal dependence: the discriminative signature for this sample is the ordering and timing of these coarse lobes \u2014 an early trough, then the strong mid hump, then late trough(s) and final rise. The STFT confirms these features are low-frequency and temporally localized; SHAP shows the classifier attributes positive weight to the mid hump low-frequency content and to some extent to the final rise/endpoint low-frequency energy. This indicates the model leverages both amplitude and time-position of broad contour features rather than small high-frequency details.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching to label descriptions and preliminary classification:\\n- Compare to the per-label summaries: Label 4 (Harrier) summary describes a dominant mid-segment slow large-amplitude rising bump around t\u224852\u201371 (trough\u2192peak contrast), an early negative trough, and a later descent then recovery. That is an almost one-to-one match with the features extracted for this sample: same mid-window strong low-frequency positive hump, similar early trough near t\u224826, and later trough/recovery structure. The STFT/SHAP agreement described in Label 4 (strong low-frequency, primary mid-window red block) is present here as well.\\n- Compared to other label summaries: Labels 0,1,2,5,6 also emphasize low-frequency lobes but their distinctive timing/asymmetry patterns differ. For example, Label 1 emphasizes a mid-segment asymmetric two-lobe cycle but its SHAP focus and temporal anchors differ (and label 1 samples in references had different emphasis on early/late patterns). Label 3 (F-14 wings opened) shows multiple negative troughs and different SHAP placement and relative timings. The four most similar training examples provided are all labeled 4 and show near-identical structure (mid hump ~t65\u201378, early trough ~t26, late trough ~t118, final recovery), confirming a very strong match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Verification with reference samples and final decision reasoning:\\n- The four similar reference samples (samples 53, 84, 42, 45; all label 4) show essentially the same waveform: early decline to deep trough near t\u224826, a modest rise to small hump around t\u224838\u201352, then a large mid hump peaking ~65\u201378, followed by a mid/late trough ~104\u2013118 and recovery to a positive endpoint. Their STFTs and SHAP heatmaps show the same concentrated low-frequency red block in the mid window. Sample 58 replicates these exact characteristics (timing, amplitude, low volatility inside lobes, and the dominant SHAP low-frequency block). \\n- The two dissimilar examples (labels 3) emphasize different mid/early patterns (and their SHAP heatmaps show other low-frequency blocks and sometimes stronger positive weight at other positions); they do not align as closely in waveform shape and timing with sample 58.\\n- Given the near-identical timing of the dominant mid hump, matching amplitude ranges (peak \u2248 +2.3 to +2.6, troughs \u2248 -1.8 to -2.0), the same low-frequency concentration in STFT and near-identical SHAP attribution locations, the evidence strongly supports classifying sample 58 as label 4 (Harrier). The match is very close to the provided Label 4 feature descriptions and to the reference-label-4 examples, so I assign the highest similarity rating.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 4 (Harrier) with similarity score 4 (high similarity).\"\n    ]\n}",

On the raw trace this corresponds to a smooth, large-amplitude upward sweep from about ~0 (or slightly negative) near t\u224852 to a very clear central peak at t\u224872\u201376 with amplitude \u2248 +2.3 to +2.6. Manifestation: low volatility inside the rise and at the crest (no high-frequency ripples), a sustained monotonic rise over ~20 time steps, average local slope during the main ascent \u2248 +0.10\u20130.18 units/step (moderate, steady). STFT: energy is concentrated in the bottom frequency rows for this same time window, confirming this is a low-frequency broad bulge.\\n- Secondary positive SHAP support: smaller low-frequency positive patches appear earlier (t \u2248 0\u20136, weaker) and near the end (t \u2248 130\u2013143) where the series has a final rise to ~+1.2. The end-region rise is positive but smaller amplitude and shorter than the main central hump (slope larger than the central rise but less time). STFT again shows low-frequency energy at the end but at lower magnitude than the main mid-window.\\n- Negative/neutral SHAP elsewhere: SHAP is neutral or slightly negative at some mid-frequency rows during the rapid drops (e.g., the descent after the central peak and the deep trough around t\u224826 and the trough near t\u2248117); the STFT shows some increased mid-frequency energy during those sharper transitions, consistent with the model slightly penalizing faster (higher-frequency) changes.\\n- Local time windows of interest in the raw trace (mapped to SHAP/time-frequency):\\n  * t\u22480\u201326: initial decline from about +1.2 down to a deep trough \u2248 -1.9 at t\u224826 \u2014 fairly smooth descent, concentrated low-frequency energy (weak-to-moderate positive SHAP overlapping the early trough). Change rate here is relatively large negative (steep initial drop).\\n  * t\u224826\u201340: recovery / small hump around t\u224838\u201340 (modest positive value ~0.0\u2013+0.1) \u2014 smaller low-frequency hump, low volatility.\\n  * t\u224852\u201378: dominant trough\u2192peak rise culminating in the large central peak (~+2.3\u2013+2.6) \u2014 main discriminative feature with strongest low-frequency SHAP.\\n  * t\u224879\u2013118: descent from the central peak down to a second deep trough near t\u2248117 (\u2248 -1.8 to -1.9). This descent is somewhat quicker than the rise (asymmetry) and shows slightly more mid-frequency content in STFT (hence weaker/neutral SHAP in mid bands).\\n  * t\u2248118\u2013143: final recovery and terminal rise to ~+1.2 at the end (low-frequency but smaller amplitude than central peak).\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall signal characterization and time\u2013frequency summary:\\n- Dominant behavior: the series is dominated by large, slow-scale (low-frequency) undulations: an early high\u2192deep trough, a prominent mid-sequence trough\u2192large peak, a later deep trough and a final rise. Most discriminative energy (and SHAP) is concentrated in the lowest-frequency bins, indicating the classifier relies on broad contour-scale features rather than short spikes.\\n- Periodicity & structure: quasi-periodic with roughly two large-scale half-cycles (trough\u2192peak\u2192trough\u2192peak) across the 144 points. The spacing of extrema is consistent (early trough near 26, main peak near 72, late trough near 117, final rise to end), so temporal ordering/phase is important.\\n- Volatility & asymmetry: volatility is low inside the slow ramps and lobes; sharper (faster) transitions\u2014notably the falls after peaks\u2014show more mid-frequency content and are down-weighted (or neutral/negative) by SHAP. The main ascent is smoother and slower than the descent from the peak (asymmetric rise/fall), a trait the model treats positively where the low-frequency rise exists.\\n- Combination/time dependence: the classifier appears to integrate multiple separated low-frequency lobes additively (early trough + dominant mid hump + later trough + terminal rise) to form a strong class cue. The main mid hump is the principal positive contributor and the other low-frequency lobes act as supporting context.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries (which label best explains observed features):\\n- Quick mapping of the sample's key motifs to label summaries:\\n  * Label 4 (Harrier) summary explicitly describes a dominant mid-segment low-frequency large-amplitude bump between ~t\u224852 and t\u224871 (rise from ~ -0.9 to +2.6), an early trough (~t=16\u201326), and a later trough followed by recovery \u2014 this is a near-token match to the sample. SHAP + STFT patterns (strong low-frequency positive area centered at the mid window) are also identical to the label-4 examples. High similarity.\\n  * Label 0,1 (Mirage, Eurofighter) also emphasize low-frequency mid/late structures in their summaries, but the specific patterning differs: Mirage often highlights multiple broad low-frequency lobes but with different timing/amplitude; Eurofighter emphasizes an asymmetric mid-cycle but with different relative sizes (smaller first hump then larger) and less pronounced single central peak as the primary cue. These show some similarity (same frequency band) but do not match the exact central-bump + early trough pattern as tightly as label 4. Moderate similarity.\\n  * Label 2,5,6 (F-14 closed, F-22, F-15) share low-frequency dominance in parts, but their canonical temporal placements and substructure details (e.g., locations of strongest troughs/peaks, asymmetry patterns and which windows the classifier weights most) are less consistent with this sample than label 4. Low-to-moderate similarity.\\n- Choose final label: label 4 (Harrier) is the best match \u2014 the main mid-segment broad hump (timing, amplitude and low-frequency content), the early trough around t\u224826, the later trough around t\u2248117 and the final recovery map very closely to label-4 descriptions and to the reference examples.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference examples and re-evaluate similarity/scoring:\\n- The four provided similar reference examples (samples 53, 84, 42, 45, all labelled 4) show nearly identical time-series waveforms: an early decline to a deep trough near t\u224826, a small mid recovery around t\u224840, a strong central peak around t\u224872\u201376 to \u2248 +2.5, a fall to a trough near t\u2248117 and a final rise toward the end. Their STFTs also concentrate energy at the same lowest-frequency bins during the mid-window and their SHAP heatmaps highlight the same bottom-row red block (mid-window). The test sample replicates those features closely (shape, amplitude, timing, STFT and SHAP alignment). This validates a high-confidence assignment to label 4.\\n- The two dissimilar references (samples 17 and 46, label 3) differ visually: they have multiple smaller mid-sequence oscillations and different SHAP patterns (more distributed or additional mid-frequency attributions). The test sample lacks those small high-frequency mid oscillations and instead has a dominant single central hump; therefore label 3 is not consistent with this sample.\\n\\nStep 5 \u2014 Similarity quantification (per-label qualitative scores, 1\u20134) \u2014 used to sanity-check and explain the final scalar score included above:\\n  * label 0 (Mirage): 3 (moderate). Shares low-frequency, multi-lobe behavior but timing/amplitude arrangement is not as tight a match as label 4.\\n  * label 1 (Eurofighter): 3 (moderate). Also emphasizes a strong mid low-frequency cycle, but the canonical two-stage hump/timing differs slightly from this sample's single dominant hump.\\n  * label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 2 (low). Some shared trough/peak occurrences exist but the precise mid-window emphasis and SHAP pattern mismatch reduces confidence.\\n  * label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 2 (low). Dissimilar in SHAP/time-frequency detail (their examples show more separated negative lobes and different mid-frequency signatures).\\n  * label 4 (Harrier): 4 (high). Best match \u2014 near one-to-one correspondence in mid-window dominant low-frequency bump (timing/amplitude), early trough and later trough/recovery; reference samples are visually almost identical.\\n  * label 5 (F-22): 2 (low). Some mid-lobe similarity but reduced amplitude/time-placement correspondence.\\n  * label 6 (F-15): 2 (low). Overall low-frequency envelope partly similar but model summary penalizes some mid-frequency transitions that this sample exhibits differently.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification:\\n- Final label: label 4 (Harrier). Rationale: the strongest SHAP attribution aligns with a large low-frequency mid-window bump (t\u224852\u201378) whose amplitude, smoothness, and timing are essentially the same as the label-4 pattern described in the reference summaries and exemplified in the four similar training samples; the early trough near t\u224826 and later trough ~t\u2248117 plus terminal rise further match label-4 structure. STFT confirms the discriminative features lie in the lowest-frequency band. Reference examples labelled 4 are visually and spectrally nearly identical to the test sample, supporting a high-confidence assignment. The similarity score for the selected label is 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

Near the end (t\u2248120\u2013144) small low-frequency positive attribution aligns with the final recovery and sequence of modest positive peaks (t\u2248120\u2013143: values ~+0.5 to +1.2). STFT at edges shows some low-frequency energy but much lower magnitude than the central hump.\",\n    \"c) Other important windows (contextual): strong negative troughs appear at early-mid times (t\u224812\u201316, min \u2248 -1.9 to -2.0) and again in the mid-late region (t\u2248102\u2013110, min \u2248 -1.6 to -1.9).

Their STFTs show the same concentrated low-frequency energy in the mid window and their SHAP heatmaps highlight the same low-frequency mid-window region. The two dissimilar references (labels 3: samples 102 and 46) differ: they present other mid-sequence patterns (more mid-window oscillatory detail and SHAP red at different time blocks) and do not place their strongest positive attribution on the same central low-frequency hump.

Mapping that to the time series: there is a single dominant, smooth, low-frequency positive hump from about t \u2248 58 up to \u2248 74 with the peak near t \u2248 70. Quantitative/qualitative description: amplitude rises from near ~+0.95 at t\u224858 to a maximum \u2248 +2.4 at t\u224870 then declines to \u2248 +0.9 by t\u224878. The rise between ~58 and ~70 is fairly steady and moderately steep (roughly +1.4 amplitude over ~12 steps \u2192 avg slope ~+0.12 units/step), volatility within the hump is low (no rapid oscillations), and the STFT confirms energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins in this window (bright low\u2011frequency band). The hump is asymmetric: relatively steady/accelerating rise and a slightly more rapid fall after the peak. This low-frequency, large-amplitude mid-segment bulge is the single most positively contributing feature to the classifier per SHAP.\",\n        \"Step 1 \u2014 Other local features (additional SHAP/plot correspondences): Additional, smaller low-frequency structures are present and align with weaker positive SHAP: an early-to-mid trough around t\u224818\u201328 reaching \u2248 -1.9 (preceded the mid hump), a modest mid-earlier rise around t\u224834\u201342 (amplitude near 0 to +0.1) and a broad late trough around t\u2248110\u2013118 reaching \u2248 -1.9 followed by a recovery and final rise to \u2248+1.2 at the end (t=143). STFT shows low-frequency energy at those windows as well; higher-frequency rows remain low-power. SHAP outside the main mid-block is weak-to-neutral, indicating the model primarily relied on the mid hump for positive evidence.\",\n        \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and temporal dependence: The time series is dominated by slow, large-scale undulations (quasi\u2011periodic low-frequency envelope) with ~3 main large lobes across 144 points: (1) early descent into a deep trough (t~8\u201328), (2) the dominant mid positive hump (t~58\u201374), and (3) a later deep trough then recovery to a positive endpoint (t~110\u2013143). Volatility is low inside the broad lobes and higher only during transition flanks (descent to troughs and ascent from troughs). The ordering matters: a deep early negative trough \u2192 smooth mid positive bulge \u2192 mid-late negative trough \u2192 final recovery pattern is clear.

This matches the test sample very closely in timing, amplitude, shape (asymmetric slow rise and faster fall), and SHAP localization. Other labels (0,1,2,5,6) also emphasize low-frequency lobes in various windows, but their characteristic timing/amplitude patterns differ: e.g., label 5 (F-22) has a smaller mid hump (lower amplitude), label 6 (F-15) shows repeated smaller peaks across a longer mid-interval and penalizes sharper mid-frequency transitions, label 3 (F-14 wings opened) has somewhat different trough/peak placement and the dissimilar reference examples differ visually. Thus label 4 is the closest match.\",\n        \"Step 3 \u2014 Numeric similarity scoring per label (1\u20134): I compared the test sample's exact temporal positions, amplitudes, asymmetry, volatility, STFT support and SHAP localization to each label summary and to the provided reference samples.

The two dissimilar references are label 3 and show different mid-structure (different phasing and SHAP localization); the test sample clearly matches the label\u20114 group rather than label\u20113.

In the raw trace this corresponds to a single, large, smooth positive hump: the signal climbs from about -0.9 near t\u224852 to a pronounced peak \u2248+2.4\u2013+2.6 at t\u224868\u201372 (net change \u2248+3.3 to +3.5).

I therefore focus on the mid-segment hump in the raw trace as the discriminative event.\\n- Precise manifestation in the time series: From about t\u224852 the signal starts a smooth, low-volatility ascent from roughly -0.9 to a pronounced peak near t\u224870 with amplitude \u2248+2.4\u2013+2.6 (net change \u2248+3.3 to +3.5). The rise spans ~18 steps (average slope \u2248 +0.18\u20130.20 units/step). Following the peak there is a sharper decline spanning ~10\u201315 steps toward zero/negative values (the descent is faster than the preceding ascent, i.e., asymmetric). Volatility during the rise and at the peak is low (no high-frequency jitter), consistent with STFT low-frequency dominance for that window. Substructure: a short preceding small valley/plateau around t\u224838\u201352 (~-0.2 to -0.9) provides a clear trough\u2192big-hump contrast that amplifies the low-frequency energy; the hump itself is single-peaked and smooth (no fine-grained ripples). This mid hump exactly overlaps the red/bottom-frequency SHAP block and is the main positive contributor to the classifier decision.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall time-series characterization:\\n- Global shape: The series shows 3\u20134 broad low-frequency lobes across 144 steps: an early positive offset (t\u22480 \u2248 +1.4), an early-to-early-mid deep trough around t\u224820\u201330 (min \u2248 -1.8), the dominant mid-segment hump (t\u224852\u201372, peak \u2248+2.4\u20132.6), a later deep trough around t\u2248116\u2013118 (min \u2248 -1.8 to -1.9), and a final recovery/rise toward the end (t\u2248130\u2013143 to \u2248+1.3\u2013+1.4). Range is large (~ -1.9 to +2.6). Volatility is generally low inside broad lobes; sharper slopes occur at transitions (notably the ascent into the main mid hump and the later descent). STFT shows most energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bin during the main mid window and moderate low-frequency energy at edges; higher-frequency bands are weak overall except during a couple sharper transitions where STFT shows slight mid-frequency content (these correspond to negative/neutral SHAP in mid-frequency rows). Temporal dependence: features are ordered and phase-linked (trough \u2192 large mid hump \u2192 trough \u2192 final rise). The mid hump is the dominant, class-determining event.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label descriptions and initial label selection:\\n- Compare to provided label patterns: The described mid-segment large, smooth positive hump (t\u224852\u201371, peak \u2248+2.6), concentrated low-frequency STFT energy there, and strong low-frequency positive SHAP attribution match the label_4 (Harrier) description closely. Label_4 summary explicitly calls out a dominant mid-segment trough\u2192peak slow rise reaching \u2248+2.6 centered around t\u224852\u201371 with strongest positive SHAP at lowest frequencies \u2014 that is essentially identical to this sample's main discriminative event. Other labels: label_1 and label_5 also emphasize mid/late low-frequency structure but their mid-window patterns differ in specific timing, asymmetry and amplitude; label_2 and label_6 present more repeated trough-peak-trough sequences or different trough timing; label_3 emphasizes different negative lobes and multiple negative excursions. Therefore the highest match is label 4.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- Reference samples 42, 53, 24, 84 (all label 4) show nearly the same waveform: an early small trough, a dominant, smooth mid hump peaking ~65\u201375 with amplitude \u2248 +2.4\u20132.6, then a post-peak decline and a late trough followed by recovery. Their STFTs show the same concentrated bottom-row energy in the mid window and their SHAP heatmaps highlight the identical low-frequency mid-segment region. The test sample's shape, timing, amplitudes, volatility profile and SHAP/STFT alignment are visually and quantitatively consistent with those references.\\n- Dissimilar examples (label 3) show different mid/late sign or multiple negative lobes and different SHAP allocation; they do not match the strong positive mid hump here.\\n\\nConclusion and scoring:\\n- The test sample's discriminative features (dominant mid-segment low-frequency hump centered ~52\u201372 with peak \u2248+2.4\u2013+2.6, low local volatility, asymmetric rise/fall, and matching STFT/SHAP signatures) are effectively identical to the label_4 (Harrier) pattern and to the provided label-4 reference examples. Thus the sample is classified as label 4 with high confidence.\\n- Similarity score: 4 (high similarity) because a nearly one-to-one correspondence exists between the sample's main features and the label_4 feature description and reference samples.\"\n  ]\n}"

The red block aligns roughly with time steps \u2248 39\u201370 (most intense approx. 50\u201365). The STFT shows strong energy in the bottom frequency band in the same mid window, confirming this is a low-frequency (broad, slow) feature rather than a high-frequency spike.\\n- Corresponding time-series manifestation (detailed):\\n  - Time range: approximately t \u2248 52 \u2192 70 (the mid-rise into the main peak), with the broader positive window running from ~39 up to ~78.\\n  - Amplitude: the signal rises from near ~-0.6 (around the early rising flank) up to the central maximum \u2248 +2.3\u2026+2.4 (peak around t\u224868\u201370). This is a large amplitude slow bulge (\u0394 \u2248 2.8\u20133.0 units across the rise).\\n  - Trend & change rate: a broadly monotonic, low-volatility upward ramp for ~15\u201320 steps followed by a faster descent afterward. Average slope during the main ascent is on the order of +0.12\u2013+0.18 units per step (moderate but still in the low-frequency band); the fall after the peak is visibly steeper.\\n  - Volatility & substructure: within the highlighted mid block the waveform is smooth (low local volatility, no high-frequency oscillations). STFT confirms concentration in the very-low-frequency rows; higher-frequency rows have little power here. No short, sharp spikes appear in that SHAP-positive area.\\n  - Shape: an asymmetric broad convex bulge (slow rise into a tall peak then faster decline) \u2014 a single prominent low-frequency peak forming the dominant shape element in the sequence.\\n- Secondary positive cues (weaker red): small low-frequency positive contributions at the start/end of the sequence (modest positive value at t\u22480 and a late upward trend near t\u2248130\u2013143). These provide additional, but secondary, supporting evidence.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall series characterization:\\n- Multi-lobe low-frequency pattern: the series shows several broad, slow undulations across 144 points: (1) an early decline to a deep trough near t\u224824\u201328 (min \u2248 -2.0), (2) the main mid-sequence broad positive bulge centered ~65\u201370 (peak \u2248 +2.3\u20132.4), (3) a mid-late negative excursion near t\u224890\u201395 (\u2248 -0.6 to -1.0), (4) a pronounced deep trough around t\u2248116\u2013118 (\u2248 -1.9 to -2.0), and (5) a final smooth strong rise to a positive endpoint (~+1.0\u2013+1.2 at t=143).\\n- Frequency & STFT summary: most energy is concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during the major events (especially the mid bulge). The STFT image shows bright bottom-row energy localized to the same mid window (confirming the SHAP low-frequency attribution).\\n- Volatility & transitions: the broad lobes are low-volatility (smooth), while transitions between lobes can be sharper (faster slopes) and show slightly more mid-frequency energy. The main discriminative evidence comes from the slow, large-scale bulges rather than any high-frequency jitter.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: the classifier\u2019s positive evidence is additive across separated low-frequency lobes \u2014 the presence and timing of the big mid bulge (plus early trough & final rise) together produce a signature. Order matters: early trough \u2192 mid bulge \u2192 later troughs \u2192 final rise is the observed sequence.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and initial similarity scoring:\\n- Comparing this sample\u2019s features to the label summaries:\\n  - Label 4 (Harrier): feature summary emphasizes a dominant mid-segment large low-frequency rise/peak around \u2248t=52\u201371 with peak \u2248+2.6, preceded by a trough, and followed by another trough and late recovery; SHAP concentrated at low-frequency rows in the mid-window. This is a near-exact match to the test sample (same mid peak timing, amplitude, asymmetry, and SHAP pattern). => similarity = 4 (high).\\n  - Label 1 (Eurofighter): also uses a mid-segment low-frequency asymmetric bulge, but the Eurofighter description down-weights late rises and emphasizes particular mid-segment two-hump structure. Test sample has a single dominant mid bulge and matches less exactly. => similarity = 3 (moderate).\\n  - Label 0 (Mirage): dominated by several low-frequency lobes and important mid-sequence rises/troughs; there is overlap in having multiple broad lobes, but Mirage summaries emphasize slightly different timing and additional low-frequency positive blocks early/late. The match is plausible but not as specific as label 4. => similarity = 3 (moderate).\\n  - Label 5 (F-22): shows a mid-sequence broad hump but generally lower amplitude and different substructure (primary hump is earlier and smaller). The test sample\u2019s central bulge is larger and timing matches label 4 better. => similarity = 2\u20133; conservatively => 3 (moderate but weaker).\\n  - Label 6 (F-15): describes a persistent low-frequency envelope across a broad middle region and penalizes abrupt mid-frequency transitions. The test sample does have a persistent low-frequency envelope but contains a stronger single dominant mid bulge and multiple deep troughs that better match Harrier. => similarity = 2 (low\u2013moderate).\\n  - Label 2 & 3 (F-14, wings closed/open): both emphasize strong troughs and multi-block low-frequency at specific time windows; some elements (early trough, later trough) are present in the test series but the hallmark central large single mid bulge at \u224865\u201370 and its SHAP concentration is described for Harrier in particular. Thus these are a weaker match. => similarity = 2 (low).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference examples (verification):\\n- Four provided \u201csimilar\u201d reference samples (samples 62, 85, 66, 45) are all labeled 4.0 and their plots, STFTs, and SHAP heatmaps are visually nearly identical to the test sample: same early positive start, trough near ~25, a dominant mid bulge peaking \u224865\u201370 around +2.4\u2013+2.6, similar low-frequency STFT energy concentrated in the mid window, and SHAP strong red in the lowest frequency rows there. This confirms the model\u2019s learned Harrier signature is exactly the pattern appearing in the test sample.\\n- Two dissimilar references (labels 3.0) show different mid-late small oscillatory texture and different SHAP distributions (more spread or different timing). They do not match the test sample as well.\\n- Given near pixel-for-pixel correspondence between the test sample and multiple reference label-4 examples across time-series shape, STFT energy localization, and SHAP attribution, the classification as label 4 is robust and consistent.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification:\\n- Final predicted label: label 4 (Harrier). Rationale: The test sample\u2019s dominant discriminative feature is a large, low-frequency mid-segment bulge centered ~52\u201370 with amplitude \u2248 +2.3\u20132.6 and asymmetric slow rise/faster fall; the SHAP map concentrates positive attribution at the lowest frequency rows in that same window and the STFT confirms strong low-frequency energy there. These exact characteristics are the primary hallmarks of the label-4 (Harrier) description and match all four provided label-4 reference examples closely. Thus the highest matching label is 4 with similarity score 4 (high similarity).\\n\\n(For transparency, per-label similarity summary used internally: label0:3, label1:3, label2:2, label3:2, label4:4, label5:3, label6:2.)\"\n  ]\n}",

The STFT confirms strong energy at the very-low-frequency bins over the same time window (bright band at bottom rows), so the model is attributing slowly-varying, large-scale content in that mid window.\\n- Corresponding time-series manifestation (fine-grained): between about t \u2248 54 and t \u2248 72 the signal rises smoothly from roughly +0.8 (mid-flank) to a pronounced broad peak \u2248 +2.4\u2013+2.6 (t \u2248 70\u201372).

Typical spacing between major extrema is ~35\u201350 time-steps, so the series is dominated by long-wavelength structure rather than short-period oscillations.\\n- Volatility & frequency content: volatility is heterogeneous \u2014 very low (smooth) within the large bulges and troughs and higher (relative) during transitions. STFT shows most spectral power in the lowest-frequency bins during the key events (especially the mid bulge), and higher frequencies are weak; this aligns with SHAP focusing on the lowest rows. Thus the classifier relies on coarse contour/shape features (broad peaks/troughs) and penalizes sharp high-frequency components.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: the classifier\u2019s attribution indicates additive and time-ordered evidence: the single most decisive feature is the mid-sequence broad peak (low-frequency, high amplitude).

The SHAP + STFT emphasis on the lowest-frequency band in the mid-window is described identically in label 4\u2019s pattern.\\n- Other labels: several labels (0,1,2,5,6) emphasize low-frequency content too, but their characteristic temporal placements, asymmetries, or additional diagnostic signatures differ. For instance, label 1 (Eurofighter) focuses on a mid-window two-hump asymmetric cycle and down\u2013fast behavior; label 5 (F-22) has mid-lobes but generally smaller central amplitude and stronger endpoint emphasis in its summaries.

Volatility is heterogeneous: smooth low-volatility in main lobes, sharper transitions around troughs and the descent after the central peak. The STFT shows the majority of power in the lowest frequency bins aligned with the main mid-window hump, while higher-frequency bands are weak; this aligns with SHAP (positive at low freq) and indicates the classifier is using large-scale contour features (timing and amplitude of broad lobes) and the ordering of these lobes as discriminative evidence.\",\n        \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching to label patterns (comparison to summary templates): I compared the extracted features with the provided per-label summaries and reference examples.

Mapping that to the time series plot: from ~t=52 the trace is near -0.9 and then rises smoothly to a pronounced peak at about t\u224870\u201372 with amplitude \u2248 +2.6. Detailed attributes of this red-marked event: (a) amplitude: a large low-frequency rise of roughly +3.5 units (from \u2248-0.9 to \u2248+2.6) culminating in the global maximum; (b) time range: the main rising flank spans roughly t\u224852\u201370 (\u224818 time steps) with the full hump visible from ~52 to ~78; (c) change rate: the rise is steady and relatively slow (average slope on the main rising flank \u2248 +0.12\u2013+0.20 units/step), not an abrupt spike; (d) volatility/substructure: the segment is smooth with very low local jitter (no high-frequency ripples) \u2014 STFT confirms concentrated energy at the bottom frequency bins in the same time window; (e) shape: an asymmetric broad peak (gentle/long rise and a somewhat faster descent after the peak). This alignment of strong low-frequency STFT energy with red low-frequency SHAP values shows the model is using this large-scale mid-sequence bulge as the primary positive evidence.\",\n        \"Step 2 \u2014 Additional local/auxiliary features and STFT support: Other time-localized structures that appear in both the plot and supporting STFT/SHAP: an early deep trough centered near t\u224825 (amplitude \u2248 -1.9) preceded by a positive start (~+1.2 at t=0) \u2014 this early trough has low-frequency energy and modest positive SHAP in neighboring low-frequency rows; a moderate small mid-hump around t\u224836\u201352 (peak \u2248 +0.0 to +0.2) with lower attribution; a late deep trough near t\u2248116 (amplitude \u2248 -1.8) followed by a final recovery to roughly +1.0 by t=143 (the final rise shows low-frequency energy and weak positive SHAP).

Volatility is low within these lobes and higher only during the steeper transitional flanks. The classifier's attributions indicate it relies on the presence, amplitude and timing/order of these large-scale bulges/troughs (i.e., phase/sequence matters).

      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 4\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local (red SHAP) feature identification and fine-grained description:\\n- SHAP localisation: The strongest red (positive) SHAP mass is concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows (near 0 Hz) between roughly time steps 39 and 75, with the most intense block centered ~52\u201370. Smaller, weaker positive patches appear near the start and very end but are much less intense.\\n- Corresponding time-series manifestation (mid-window 39\u201375): The trace rises smoothly from a slightly negative/near-zero level at ~t=39 to a pronounced peak at t\u224868\u201370 (peak value \u2248 +2.4 to +2.6). Amplitude change is large: roughly from \u2248 -0.9 at the trough before the rise to \u2248 +2.5 at the peak (\u0394 \u2248 +3.4). The rise is mostly monotonic and low-volatility (no high-frequency jitter) over ~30 time steps, giving an average slope on the main ascent of about +0.10\u2013+0.20 units/step (accelerating a bit in the final ~8\u201312 steps). The STFT confirms this event is dominated by very low frequencies (bright energy in the bottom rows during the same time window). SHAP highlights those low-frequency components as strongly positive, so the classifier is using this broad, high-amplitude central hump as primary evidence.\\n- Other positive-but-weaker SHAP-aligned segments: (a) Early trough (t\u224810\u201326): the series shows a steep decline to a wide trough around t\u224824\u201326 (minimum \u2248 -1.9 to -2.0). SHAP gives modest positive weight at low frequency for the leading portion of this trough, and STFT shows low-frequency energy there. Volatility inside the trough is low. (b) Late recovery (t\u2248117\u2013143): a deep negative valley near t\u2248116\u2013118 (\u2248 -1.8 to -2.0) followed by a fairly rapid sustained rise to a positive endpoint (~+1.1 at t=143). SHAP gives modest positive low-frequency attribution near the final rise as well; STFT again shows low-frequency energy supporting it.\\n- Negative/neutral contributions: Mid-frequency rows in the interval roughly 78\u2013104 show neutral-to-slight negative SHAP (blueish), matching the faster descent from the central peak and some steeper transitions which the model penalizes relative to smooth low-frequency structure.\\n- Unique discriminative description: The classifier is responding to a three-part low-frequency pattern: (1) an early deep trough (~t=16\u201326), (2) a dominant broad mid-sequence positive hump (~t=39\u201375, peak \u2248+2.5), and (3) a later deep trough then recovery to a positive endpoint (~t=116\u2013143). Each of these is smooth (low volatility) and spectrally concentrated at the lowest frequency bins per STFT \u2014 exactly the regions SHAP marks red.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and relationships between features:\\n- Global trend & periodicity: The signal exhibits slow, quasi-periodic large-scale undulations (low-frequency envelope) across the 144 points rather than high-frequency oscillations. There are roughly two or three broad lobes across the sequence: an early descent into a trough, a mid large positive bulge, and a late trough + recovery. STFT energy is concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during these lobes.\\n- Volatility and change rates: Within the major lobes volatility is low and transitions are smooth; the steepest local slopes occur at transitions (early descent and late rise), but these are still low-frequency relative to the sequence length. The classifier prefers the slow rises/peaks (positive SHAP) and downweights sharper mid-frequency content (negative/neutral SHAP around faster drops).\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: The model appears to combine the presence and ordering of the lobes \u2014 an early trough -> big mid hump -> late trough + recovery \u2014 to form a discriminative signature. The mid-hump is the strongest single positive contributor; the early trough and final recovery act as reinforcing context features. This ordering and amplitude asymmetry (slow rise into a large peak, followed by faster descent) are consistent across the series and are what the model uses.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and initial label selection:\\n- Comparing the described features to the label summaries: Label 4 (Harrier) summary repeatedly emphasizes a dominant mid-segment low-frequency large-amplitude hump centered roughly t\u224852\u201371 rising from a trough near t\u224838\u201352 to a peak \u2248+2.6, preceded by an early trough (~t=16\u201326), and followed by a decline into a later valley and a moderate endpoint recovery. The current sample's mid hump (\u2248t39\u201375 with peak \u2248+2.4\u20132.6), early trough (\u2248t16\u201326, \u2248-1.9), and late trough/recovery (\u2248t116\u2013143) align strongly and precisely with that label's pattern descriptions.\\n- Degree of match vs. other labels: Other labels (0,1,2,5,6) also emphasize low-frequency structure but with different temporal placements and asymmetries (e.g., label 1 emphasizes a mid-window asymmetric double hump and late rise but discounts early decline; label 2 emphasizes troughs at different relative times; label 3 patterns often show multiple separated negative lobes). The strongest one-to-one correspondence in timing, amplitude and SHAP-low-frequency concentration is with label 4.\\n- Initial selection: Label 4 (Harrier) is the best match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- Reference samples 1\u20134 are all labeled 4 and their plots and STFT/SHAP maps are visually and quantitatively very similar to the test sample: they show the same early trough (~t\u224816\u201326), a dominant mid hump peaked near 65\u201370 with peak ~+2.4\u2013+2.6, low-frequency STFT energy concentrated in the same mid-window, and strong red SHAP at the lowest frequencies over the mid window. The test sample overlays these features nearly identically (same timing of maxima/minima, similar amplitudes and smooth shape). The provided label-4 feature summary enumerates the exact same discriminative elements (dominant central hump, early trough, later decline and recovery), matching almost verbatim.\\n- Dissimilar samples (labels 3) show different structure: although they also have low-frequency content, their main positive SHAP regions and mid-sequence shapes differ (more scattered peaks, different timing, and SHAP patterns not concentrated in the same mid-window). This further supports that the test sample is not label 3.\\n- Fairness & scoring logic: Given the near one-to-one match in (a) location and amplitude of dominant mid hump, (b) presence and timing of early trough, (c) late trough + recovery, (d) STFT low-frequency alignment, and (e) SHAP attribution concentrated at the same low-frequency & time windows, the match is very strong. According to the provided similarity scale, this is 'High similarity' (4 points).\\n\\nFinal decision:\\n- Predicted label: label 4 (Harrier).\\n- Similarity score: 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}"

I therefore inspect the raw trace at those time ranges and the STFT low-frequency band for frequency confirmation.\\n- Early segment (t \u2248 0 \u2192 20): the trace begins at a very large positive value (~+2.6 to +2.8 at t=0) then falls steeply to a deep trough near t\u224818\u201326 (~ -1.4 to -1.6). Rate and shape: large net drop (~ -3.2 to -4.0 total) with an average slope roughly -0.15 to -0.23 units/step in that initial decline. Volatility: the descent is smooth (low short-term wiggle), and STFT energy here appears concentrated in the lowest frequency bins. SHAP shows only light-to-moderate positive attribution at the very lowest frequency for the earliest times (so the model treats this broad early decline as modestly supportive, but not the dominant cue).\\n- Primary mid hump (t \u2248 48 \u2192 66): a broad, smooth positive bulge peaking near +0.8\u2013+0.95 around t\u224854\u201366. Manifestation: the series rises from near 0 (or slightly negative) up to the hump over ~10\u201318 steps \u2014 average slope roughly +0.05\u2013+0.12 units/step depending on the sub-window \u2014 then falls again, all with low local volatility. STFT: elevated energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins in the same time window. SHAP: very strong positive (deep red) concentrated in the bottom frequency rows here. Interpretation: this broad, low-frequency, asymmetric rise-to-peak is a primary positive driver.\\n- Secondary mid-late hump (t \u2248 76 \u2192 92): a second broad positive excursion peaks near +0.6\u2013+0.8 around t\u224878\u201386, again low-volatility inside the lobe. STFT again shows most energy at very-low frequencies; SHAP is strongly positive at low frequency across this block but slightly weaker than the primary hump. The pair (primary hump then a second hump) forms a multi-lobe low-frequency motif.\\n- Small local micro-structure (t \u2248 62 \u2192 70): tiny higher-frequency wiggles (few points of small amplitude \u00b10.05\u20130.15) appear on the falling flank of the mid hump; STFT shows minimal mid-frequency energy and SHAP there is near-neutral. These micro-wiggles are not positively attributed and are effectively ignored by the classifier.\\n- Late deep trough and final rise (t \u2248 100 \u2192 143): after a mid/late descent the series reaches another deep trough roughly t\u2248110\u2013120 (~ -1.5 to -1.6) and then a sustained, fairly steep final rise from \u2248125 to the endpoint at \u2248+2.6\u2013+2.8 (t=143). STFT shows renewed low-frequency energy at the end; SHAP shows modest positive attribution at the lowest frequencies near the final segment. The final rise's slope (~+0.12 units/step averaged over ~20 steps) provides additional supportive evidence.\\n- Frequency confirmation: across all the SHAP-positive windows, STFT confirms energy concentration in the very-low-frequency bins (bottom rows). Higher-frequency rows show little energy and SHAP in those rows is neutral-to-slightly-negative in places. This supports an interpretation that the classifier is driven by broad contour-scale components rather than short spikes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall sample characterization and dependence of features:\\n- Global trend & periodicity: the signal is quasi-periodic with several broad low-frequency lobes across the 144 points \u2014 an initial large positive to deep trough, then at least two prominent mid-sequence positive lobes, a mid/late trough, and a strong terminal rise. This yields most spectral energy at the lowest frequency bins and repeating low-frequency structure (rough period ~40\u201370 steps between major extrema).\\n- Volatility: volatility is low within each broad lobe (smooth monotonic rises/falls) and higher only during the transitions (the steep early drop and the steep late recoveries). High-frequency jitter is minimal and not emphasized by SHAP.\\n- Temporal dependence / combination: the classifier appears to combine several separated low-frequency events additively \u2014 the mid primary hump (strongest), the secondary hump (supporting), the early large baseline/trough pattern, and the final large rise all together increase the score. The relative ordering matters: the mid-sequence pair of broad positive lobes preceded and followed by troughs forms a distinctive signature.\\n- Concise summary of the pattern: large endpoints (high at both start and end), an early steep descent to a wide trough, then a two-lobe low-frequency mid structure (primary hump ~50\u201366 and a supportive hump ~76\u201392), followed by a late trough and a sharp final ascent.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Compare to label feature summaries and select best match:\\n- Label 5 (F-22) summary highlights: \\\"primary broad positive hump between ~36\u201370 (rise to ~+0.8), a secondary positive lobe around ~78\u201392, plus large endpoint amplitudes at start and end; SHAP positive at low-freq in those mid windows\\\". This aligns almost exactly with the observed sample: same mid-window primary hump, secondary mid-late hump, start/end large positive offsets, and SHAP concentrated at very-low-frequency. Match level: HIGH (4/4).\\n- Label 0 (Mirage): also emphasizes low-frequency mid windows, multi-lobe structure and final rise, but some specifics differ (Mirage notes a different timing emphasis and slightly different relative amplitudes). Reasonable similarity but slightly less precise alignment than F-22. Match level: MODERATE\u2013HIGH (3/4).\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): emphasizes a dominant mid-segment low-frequency asymmetric cycle (39\u201395) with smaller early/late attribution differences. Some similarity exists (mid-window low-frequency hump and asymmetry), but Eurofighter summary downplays start/end amplitudes and emphasizes a specific asymmetry and order of two humps that is similar but not as tight as the F-22 description here. Match level: MODERATE (3/4).\\n- Label 6 (F-15): describes broad low-frequency envelope across middle, twin peaks and a terminal rise, but penalizes certain sharper transitions around 78\u2013104 (mid-frequency negative SHAP). Our sample shows little penalization in that zone and the SHAP is positive there, so less ideal. Match level: MODERATE (3/4).\\n- Label 2 and 3 (F-14 closed/open): both have multi trough/hump low-frequency structure, but their characteristic timing and the presence of very deep early or repeated troughs in specific windows were different from our sample's dominant mid positive lobes and endpoints. Match level: LOW\u2013MODERATE (2/4).\\n- Label 4 (Harrier): has a dominant single mid-segment large bump (t \u2248 52\u201371) and other troughs; some similarity because our sample also has a strong mid bump, but Harrier emphasizes a single dominant mid hump plus less pronounced repeated mid-late hump and a specific trough-to-peak contrast. The presence of two clear mid lobes and strong endpoint symmetry in our sample aligns more cleanly with F-22 than with Harrier. Match level: LOW\u2013MODERATE (2/4).\\n\\nSelection: Label 5 (F-22) has the highest and most specific agreement (primary mid hump at ~36\u201370, secondary hump near ~78\u201392, large start/end amplitudes, and SHAP concentrated at very-low-frequency in the mid-sequence). Therefore final predicted label is label 5 with high similarity.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference examples and final verification:\\n- The four retrieved 'similar' reference samples are all labeled 5 and their plots, STFT images and SHAP maps are visually almost identical to the test sample: identical early large positive start, early decline to trough, primary mid hump (~50\u201366), secondary hump (~78\u201392), deep trough later and large terminal rise; all show red SHAP concentrated in the same low-frequency bottom rows. This strongly confirms that the classifier learned this pattern as the F-22 signature and that our sample matches those reference examples with near identity.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' examples (both labeled 4) show different global shapes and different SHAP distributions (more pronounced single dominant central peak or different mid/high-frequency attribution patterns) \u2014 these differ visually and in SHAP emphasis from our test sample. That supports rejecting label 4 for this sample.\\n- Given the tight visual, spectral and SHAP alignment with the label-5 references and the label-5 feature summary, the classification is robust. I assign label 5 and rate similarity as 4/4 (high similarity). The alternative labels that show some overlap (0,1,6) receive lower scores because they lack the complete match of both the exact mid-window two-lobe pattern plus the strong symmetric endpoints and SHAP concentration that characterize this sample.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 5 (F-22), similarity score 4 (high).\"\n    ]\n}",

Using that time window on the trace yields three clearly identifiable low-frequency events that carry positive attribution:\\n  1) Primary mid hump (\u2248 t 36\u201370, strongest support around t ~50\u201360): the series rises from a local negative valley just before this window (\u2248 -0.9 at t\u224836) up to a broad peak near +0.7\u2026+0.9 (peak \u2248 +0.8 around t\u224854\u201358). The shape is a smooth, low-volatility, low-frequency single-cycle bump (little high-frequency noise on the hump). The rise from trough to peak takes ~15\u201320 steps; average ascent slope ~+0.05\u2013+0.08 units/step. STFT shows concentrated energy at the lowest frequency bins during this interval, consistent with a broad slow bulge.\\n  2) Secondary mid-late hump (\u2248 t 72\u201392, peak around t\u224878\u201386): a smaller broad positive excursion peaking \u2248 +0.6\u2026+0.8. Again low local volatility and low-frequency spectral energy; SHAP also attributes positive weight at the lowest rows here (though slightly weaker than the primary hump).\\n  3) Endpoint rise (\u2248 t 130\u2013143): a strong final slow rise from near 0 (\u2248 t130) to a final value \u2248 +2.7 at t=143. This terminal bulge is low-frequency and receives modest positive SHAP attribution at the lowest rows in the very-right columns of the heatmap.\\n- Complementary negative/neutral features nearby: early rapid descent (t 0\u219220) from \u2248+2.7 down to \u2248 -1.6 is visible but SHAP there is neutral/weak (the classifier rewarded later low-frequency lobes more). Small high-frequency wiggles are visible around the troughs (~t 62\u201368 and ~t 66\u201370 small ripples) but STFT energy there is low compared with the bottom rows; SHAP for mid/higher frequency rows is near neutral. A deep trough around t\u224816\u201322 (\u2248 -1.6) and another trough around t\u2248112\u2013118 (~ -1.6) are present; these troughs are low-frequency and provide contextual shape but the strongest positive attributions are the broad positive lobes described above.\\n- Volatility and change-rate specifics: low volatility inside the broad lobes (smooth ramps), occasional small fast fluctuations only around transitions. The final ascent (t\u2248130\u2013143) is the steepest sustained upward slope in the later sequence (~+0.15\u2013+0.22 units/step), while the mid-hump rises are gentler (~+0.05\u2013+0.08 units/step). STFT confirms the dominant content of the positively attributed windows is at the very-low-frequency bins (bottom rows) with little relative energy at higher frequencies.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall sample-level description and temporal dependence:\\n- Dominant character: the sample is governed by large-scale, low-frequency contour structure (a slow multi-lobed envelope) across the 144 points. There are 2\u20133 broad undulations: an early large descent into a trough, a main mid positive hump, a secondary mid-late hump, a late trough, then a strong terminal rise.\\n- Periodicity & frequency: quasi-periodic at long time scales (periods on the order of 30\u201350 steps). STFT and SHAP both indicate most discriminative energy is in the lowest-frequency bands throughout the mid and end windows.\\n- Volatility: generally low within each broad lobe; higher instantaneous slope during transitional segments (notably the initial drop and the final climb). Small high-frequency wiggles appear only as minor texture and are not attributed as positive evidence by SHAP.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: the classifier appears to treat the combination of mid-sequence broad positive hump(s) plus a large endpoint bulge as a compound signature. The ordering matters: trough \u2192 broad mid hump \u2192 another hump \u2192 trough \u2192 final rise. SHAP shows additive positive attribution across the low-frequency bottom rows when these lobes appear in sequence, indicating the model uses the timing and sequence of broad contour features rather than isolated spikes.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching sample features to label summaries and choosing the best label:\\n- Label 5 (F-22) summary key points: strong positive SHAP at lowest-frequency rows between ~36\u201370 (primary hump), repeated smaller lobes later, and supportive edge amplitudes; classifier emphasis on broad, low-frequency hump(s) mid-sequence with endpoint contributions. This matches the test sample very closely: test has a pronounced mid hump ~36\u201370, additional positive hump ~78\u201392, and strong endpoint rise at the end. STFT/SHAP patterns align closely. => Similarity score for label 5: 4 (high similarity).\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): also emphasizes a dominant mid-segment low-frequency asymmetric cycle (approx 39\u201395) and a late rising trend. The test sample shares the mid-segment low-frequency multi-lobe behavior and a late strong rise, so there is moderate similarity in overall low-frequency emphasis and the mid-window hump structure. However, Eurofighter descriptions emphasize a specific small-hump \u2192 larger-hump asymmetry and typically discount large endpoint extremes; test sample's endpoint bulge is stronger (and label-5 summaries note endpoint support). => Similarity score for label 1: 3 (moderate).\\n- Label 6 (F-15): describes broad low-frequency envelope across the middle of the series, with repeated broad peaks/troughs and endpoint bulge; it also penalizes abrupt mid-frequency transitions. The test matches the broad envelope and endpoint bulge, but label-6 notes penalization of sharp mid-window drops and has slightly different timing/phase of peaks. Test matches parts but aligns better with label-5 specific mid-hump amplitudes and timing. => Similarity score for label 6: 3 (moderate).\\n- Labels 0, 2, 3, 4 (Mirage, F-14 closed, F-14 opened, Harrier): all of these emphasize low-frequency structure too but with characteristic differences (for example, label 0 often highlights strong mid-window trough\u2192rise around 26\u201365 and repeated broad peaks with specific amplitude shapes; label 2/3 have different trough/peak timings or a pattern of early trough then late troughs; label 4 emphasizes a single dominant mid hump near ~52\u201371 often bigger than others). The test sample's mid-hump timing and the presence of several low-frequency lobes plus a very large endpoint rise match label-5 prototypes better than these other labels. Visual comparison to their reference plots reveals shape differences (e.g., label-4 has a single dominant trough\u2192peak at a different location; label-2/3 sequences show troughs/peaks at different relative positions). => Similarity scores: label 0: 2, label 2: 2, label 3: 2, label 4: 2 (low similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four similar references (samples 28, 21, 72, 10 \u2014 all labeled 5) are visually and spectrally almost indistinguishable from the test sample: they share the initial high value then deep early trough, a primary slow mid hump near t\u224850\u201360, a secondary hump later, and a strong terminal rise; their STFTs show strongest energy in the lowest-frequency rows in the same time windows; their SHAP heatmaps show very similar red blocks at the bottom rows in the mid-region. This close match across waveform shape, timing of lobes, STFT energy and SHAP attribution confirms that label 5 is the correct assignment and supports a high similarity score (4).\\n- The two dissimilar references (samples 3 and 84 labeled 4) show noticeably different mid/central structure: sample 3/84 have a single, much larger central peak around ~60\u201370 with different surrounding troughs and more energy in different time bins; their SHAP maps also show distributed attribution across more frequency rows (and different time alignment). Those differences further strengthen the choice of label 5 for the test sample.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification summary:\\n- The test sample matches the label-5 (F-22) feature pattern very closely: mid-sequence broad positive hump (\u224836\u201370) as the strongest discriminative event, one or more supporting broad lobes later (\u224872\u201392), and a strong low-frequency terminal rise \u2014 all with SHAP positive attribution concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows and STFT confirming low-frequency dominance. The provided label-5 reference samples are nearly identical in waveform, STFT, and SHAP pattern. Therefore the predicted label is label 5 with a high similarity score of 4.\\n\\nPer-label similarity scores used in my reasoning (for transparency):\\n- label 0: 2\\n- label 1: 3\\n- label 2: 2\\n- label 3: 2\\n- label 4: 2\\n- label 5: 4 (chosen)\\n- label 6: 3\"\n  ]\n}"

The SHAP shows modest positive low-frequency attribution near the end and the STFT indicates low-frequency energy reappearing at the edges.\",\n    \"  - Local/high-frequency detail: Small high-frequency wiggles are present (for example around t\u224866\u201370 and a few ticks near 100), but the STFT shows these have low energy relative to the bottom-frequency band and the SHAP map is neutral to slightly negative at mid-frequency rows. This indicates those fast small oscillations are not driving the positive class evidence.\",\n    \"Summary of Task 1: The red/positive SHAP regions map to broad, smooth, low-frequency bulges (two main mid-sequence positive lobes) and the low-frequency rising fronts out of wide troughs; amplitudes for the bulges are ~+0.6\u2013+0.8, trough depths ~-1.4 to -1.8, slopes of rises ~+0.07\u2013+0.17 units/step depending on segment, and local volatility within these lobes is low (no sharp spikes).\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and dependencies: The full series is dominated by low-frequency, quasi-periodic large-scale undulations with three main cycles visible over the 144 points: (1) an early descent from a high start (~+2.7 at t=0) into a deep trough (~t=24\u201328), (2) a mid-sequence pair of broad positive lobes (peaks ~t=54\u201360 and ~t=82\u201390) separated by trough-like dips, and (3) a late deep trough (~t\u2248115) followed by a strong terminal rise to an end maximum (~t=143). Volatility is heterogeneous: low inside broad lobes, modest on ramps, and higher only for small localized ticks. The STFT indicates most signal energy relevant to classification lives in the lowest frequency bins (consistent across the positive SHAP windows). Temporal dependence is strong: the classifier\u2019s positive attributions align with the timing and ordering of trough\u2192slow rise\u2192broad peak events rather than isolated spikes \u2014 i.e., sequence and relative timing of broad lobes matter.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Compare observed features to label descriptions and choose label: I compared the above pattern to the feature summaries. Label 5 (F-22) descriptions emphasize: a dominant mid-sequence broad positive hump around ~36\u201370 with a steeper rise into a broad peak, repeated low-frequency lobes, modest supporting endpoint amplitudes, and low-frequency dominance in STFT \u2014 all matching the sample. The provided similar reference samples (Samples 5, 98, 6, 34) are nearly identical in waveform shape, STFT low-frequency signatures, and SHAP low-frequency positive blocks across the mid-window; all are labeled 5. Other labels differ: label 4 (Harrier) focuses on a very large single mid hump of higher amplitude and stronger asymmetry; label 2/3 (F-14) show different trough/peak timing and different arrangements; label 0/1/6 have some overlapping low-frequency traits but not the same mid-window two-lobe pattern with the specific trough and endpoint symmetry seen here. Therefore label 5 is the best match.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Quantified similarity check and sanity with reference samples: I rechecked against the provided reference examples. The four 'similar' references are all label 5 and their time-series, STFT and SHAP patterns match sample 12 extremely closely (same number and timing of broad lobes, endpoint high positives, low volatility inside lobes, and SHAP red concentrated in lowest-frequency rows between ~39 and ~104). The two 'dissimilar' references are label 4 and differ notably (they show a single dominant central peak near t\u224865 with different shape and SHAP patterns). Given these cross-checks, the assignment to label 5 is consistent and robust.\",\n    \"Final scoring rationale: I assign the chosen label 5 a similarity score of 4 (high similarity) because (a) the mid-sequence two broad low-frequency positive lobes, trough timing, endpoint large positive, and low-frequency STFT energy exactly match the label_5 pattern description; (b) the retrieved training references for label 5 are near-identical in shape, STFT, and SHAP layout; and (c) competing labels either lack these specific ordered low-frequency lobes or emphasize different central/peak morphologies. Therefore the most accurate classification is label 5 with high confidence.\"\n  ]\n}",

Mapping that to the time series and STFT gives the following fine-grained features: (a) Primary mid hump (approx. t=50\u201366): a smooth, low-volatility rise from just below 0 to about +0.7\u2013+0.8, peak around t\u224855\u201360, then a gentle fall. Amplitude ~0.7\u20130.8, change rate on the rise ~+0.05\u2013+0.12 units/step, low local volatility (no sharp spikes). STFT: concentrated energy in the lowest frequency bins for this interval, consistent with a slow, broad lobe. (b) Secondary mid/late hump (approx. t=76\u201392): another broad low-frequency positive bulge with peak amplitude ~+0.6\u2013+0.8 near t\u224885\u201390, preceded and followed by troughs (the fall into this hump is somewhat steeper than its preceding small trough). Again low local volatility and low-frequency STFT energy. (c) Small positive bump around t\u2248102\u2013108: lower amplitude (~+0.1\u2013+0.2), short-lived, contributes little compared to the two main lobes. (d) Endpoints: the series begins very positive (~+2.6\u2013+2.8 at t=0) and ends very positive (~+2.6\u2013+2.8 at t=143). STFT shows low-frequency energy at the edges; SHAP gives modest positive attribution at low-frequency near the ends but the dominant SHAP mass is the mid-sequence low-frequency lobes. (e) Contrast windows: deep trough near t\u224820\u201328 (min \u2248 -1.6 to -1.8) and another trough near t\u2248115\u2013120 (~-1.4 to -1.6) form the large-scale valley/peak pattern bracketing the positive lobes. Those troughs have low-frequency content and help define the multi-lobe slow envelope. In short, the red (positive) SHAP region corresponds to two broad, slow positive lobes in the mid-sequence (50\u201366 and 76\u201392) with concentrated very-low-frequency energy and low volatility; these are the classifier's main supporting evidence.\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and temporal dependence: The trace is dominated by low-frequency, multi-lobe structure across 144 points \u2014 quasi-periodic broad oscillations rather than short, sharp spikes. Global pattern: high positive at the start \u2192 steep decline into an early trough (~t=20\u201328) \u2192 recovery into a first mid positive hump (~t=50\u201366) \u2192 dip and rise into a second mid positive hump (~t=76\u201392) \u2192 fall into a later trough (~t=115) \u2192 strong final rise to a large positive endpoint. Volatility is generally low within the large lobes (smooth ramps) with small higher-frequency wiggles only in short windows (these small ripples are low-power in the STFT and have neutral-to-minor SHAP). STFT and SHAP agree that relevant signal energy is concentrated at the very lowest frequencies during the main supporting windows, indicating the classifier relies on large-scale contour/shape features and their order (trough \u2192 hump \u2192 hump \u2192 trough \u2192 final rise). The features combine temporally: the mid-sequence double-hump (timing and relative amplitudes) plus endpoint high values form a composite signature rather than any single isolated spike.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries and selection of best label: I compared the identified local and global features to the provided per-label summaries. The strongest correspondences are: - Label 5 (F-22): description explicitly notes a primary mid hump around ~36\u201370 (broad rise to about +0.8) and a secondary hump ~78\u201392, plus large positive endpoints (~+2.8). SHAP in that label's examples concentrates on the same very-low-frequency mid windows. This is a near-exact match to the sample's two mid low-frequency lobes, low volatility, and high endpoints. - Other labels (0,1,2,6) also emphasize low-frequency broad features, troughs and mid-sequence activity, but the specific combination (two mid positive lobes at ~50\u201366 and ~78\u201392, start/end large positives) matches Label 5 most closely. Therefore the classifier label selected is label 5 (F-22).\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Quantified similarity to each label (1\u20134) and justification: I scored similarity between Sample 12 and each label based on how many distinctive, high-weighted features match (timing, amplitude pattern, STFT/SHAP low-frequency localization, and ordering). Scores: - label 0 (Mirage): 3 (moderate). Rationale: shares low-frequency multi-lobe structure and final large rise, but Mirage examples emphasize different timing/amplitude patterns (strong mid-window trough\u2192rise at ~25\u201365 and other lobes) which are not as close to the double-hump + endpoints as label 5. - label 1 (Eurofighter): 3 (moderate). Rationale: Eurofighter summary emphasizes a large asymmetric mid-cycle around ~39\u201395 \u2014 similar in being low-frequency and mid-located, but Eurofighter's distinguishing asymmetry and lesser emphasis on large symmetric endpoints reduce the match. - label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 3 (moderate). Rationale: F-14 (closed) has multiple low-frequency troughs and humps across the sequence; some timing overlaps exist (early trough + mid humps + late trough), but the specific two mid positive lobes plus very large endpoints align better with label 5. - label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 2 (low). Rationale: label 3 emphasizes deep negative troughs and somewhat different pulse ordering; Sample 12 has troughs but the mid positive double-lobe and endpoint pattern fit F-22 more closely. - label 4 (Harrier): 2 (low). Rationale: Harrier descriptions emphasize a single dominant, large mid-segment hump (amplitude ~+2.6) and strong asymmetry; Sample 12's mid humps are much smaller (~+0.7\u20130.8) so it is not a close match. - label 5 (F-22): 4 (high). Rationale: near-perfect alignment: primary mid hump ~36\u201370, secondary hump ~78\u201392, low-frequency energy in those windows, and large positive endpoints; reference samples provided (samples labeled 5 in the reference set) are visually and spectrally extremely similar to Sample 12 \u2014 same timing, amplitude relationships, STFT low-frequency concentration and SHAP positive localization. - label 6 (F-15): 3 (moderate). Rationale: F-15 summary emphasizes a broad low-frequency envelope across the middle with peaks around +0.6\u20130.8 and troughs near -1.3, similar to Sample 12, but F-15 also penalizes sharper mid transitions (some mid transitions in Sample 12 are moderate) and stresses sustained envelope across many windows; still, similarities are substantial.\",\n    \"Step 5 \u2014 Cross-check with reference examples and fairness check: The four provided similar reference samples are all labeled 5 and are visually almost identical to the test sample: same start and end large positive values, early trough at ~t=20\u201328, two mid positive lobes near the same locations and amplitudes, and similar STFT/SHAP low-frequency attribution patterns. The two dissimilar examples are label 4 (Harrier) and show a notably different dominant central peak shape and different SHAP frequency/time attribution; they do not match Sample 12 well. This cross-check confirms that the selection of label 5 is consistent, the scoring is fair (highest score for label 5), and the per-label similarity scores above reflect real, measured differences in timing, amplitude and spectral/SHAP attributions. Conclusion: the most accurate classification is label 5 (F-22) with high similarity (score 4).\"\n  ]\n}",

This identifies the classifier's most important time\u2013frequency evidence as slow, low-frequency components in that mid segment.\\n- Corresponding time-series manifestation (mid window ~39\u2013104):\\n  - Shape & substructure: The series in this interval is composed of a sequence of broad low-frequency lobes: a modest positive hump around t\u224839\u201345, followed by a larger, smooth positive bulge peaking roughly t\u224852\u201360 (amplitude ~+0.6 to +0.9), then a moderate descent to slightly negative values (~t\u224865\u201372, amplitude about -0.4 to -0.8), and then another broad positive rise peaking around t\u224878\u201390 (amplitude ~+0.6 to +0.8). These lobes are low-volatility (smooth) and appear as multi-stage, long-wavelength undulations rather than sharp spikes.\\n  - Amplitude & trend: Amplitudes of the main mid-lobes are modest compared with endpoints (mid peaks around +0.6\u2013+0.9; nearby troughs around -0.4 to -1.0). The overall mid-segment shows alternating rise/fall cycles (slow ascent -> peak -> slower/medium descent -> second broad ascent) occurring over tens of steps (typical duration 10\u201325 steps per lobe).\\n  - Change rate & volatility: Within each broad lobe slopes are moderate and smooth (average local slopes ~+0.04\u2013+0.15 units/step on rises); volatility inside lobes is low (no large high-frequency oscillations). Small, brief higher-frequency wiggles (amplitude ~0.05\u20130.2) appear in the troughs (notably ~t=65\u201370) but have low spectral power and are not strongly attributed by SHAP.\\n  - Frequency evidence: The STFT confirms most of the energy for the mid-window events is concentrated in the lowest frequency bins (bottom rows). Higher-frequency bins show only small energy during rapid transitions, consistent with SHAP emphasizing the DC/very-low-frequency bands.\\n- Other positively-attributed regions: The SHAP map shows weaker positive attribution near the sequence start and end at low frequencies. In the raw plot the sequence starts high (~+2.6 at t=0) and finishes with a strong final rise (~+2.6 at t=143) \u2014 these large endpoints provide additional low-frequency energy but with smaller SHAP intensity compared with the mid-window block.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 overall-series features and temporal combination:\\n- Global shape & periodicity: The series is dominated by slow, quasi-periodic broad undulations (low fundamental frequency) across the full 144 points. Approximately 2\u20133 large-scale lobes (trough\u2013peak cycles) are visible across the trace: an early steep fall from a high start into a deep trough (~t\u224810\u201326), a mid block of alternating broad lobes (~t\u224836\u201395), and a late trough followed by a strong final rise (~t\u2248104\u2013143). The spacing between major extrema is on the order of 30\u201350 steps, consistent with strong low-frequency content in STFT.\\n- Volatility pattern: Low volatility during the broad lobes (smooth monotonic ramps); occasional localized higher-frequency noise (small wiggles) occurs in troughs/mid-transitions (e.g., ~t\u224865\u201370), but these have low spectral power and neutral/weak SHAP attribution.\\n- Interaction of features (temporal dependence): The classifier\u2019s SHAP attribution gives high positive weight to the mid-window low-frequency bulges (timing and relative amplitudes matter). The pattern of smaller hump \u2192 larger hump \u2192 descent is phase-ordered and exploited by the model (i.e., the presence and ordering of mid-segment slow bulges is decisive). Endpoint bulges reinforce class evidence but are secondary to mid-window morphology.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 matching to label summaries and selection:\\n- Quick label-by-label comparison (high level):\\n  - Label 0 (Mirage): emphasizes strong low-frequency blocks at several positions, early positive baseline and final rise; some overlap but Mirage descriptions emphasize different timing and particular trough\u2192rise patterns; partial match but not best.\\n  - Label 1 (Eurofighter): strong asymmetric mid-cycle around ~39\u201395 but Eurofighter summary downweights late endpoints and places primacy on a specific mid-asymmetric two-lobe pattern; moderate match but less aligned with endpoints and amplitudes seen here.\\n  - Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): characterized by multiple troughs and specific windows (~13\u201326, ~78\u201391, ~104\u2013120). The test series has some similar troughs but the mid positive lobes and overall shape align better elsewhere.\\n  - Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): dominated by deep negative lobes and a late large upward swing; some similarities exist but the mid positive double-lobe timing and mild amplitudes differ.\\n  - Label 4 (Harrier): central big hump around t\u224852\u201371 (large amplitude ~+2.6 in Harrier examples) \u2014 Harrier\u2019s central hump is much larger and asymmetric than observed here; dissimilar amplitude-wise.\\n  - Label 5 (F-22): description explicitly lists a primary broad low-frequency positive hump between ~36\u201370 (rise from ~-0.9 to +0.8), plus a secondary positive lobe near ~78\u201392 and large positive endpoints. The STFT and SHAP emphasis on low-frequency mid-window energy and the time locations of the lobes match this label very closely.\\n  - Label 6 (F-15): persistent low-frequency envelope across mid region with twin peaks and penalties for mid-frequency sharp transitions. Some overlap in low-frequency dominance, but F-15 descriptions include particular trough/peak shapes and negative mid-frequency penalties in slightly different windows.\\n- Best match: Label 5 (F-22). The test sample\u2019s dominant mid-segment broad positive lobe centered ~36\u201370, a secondary broad lobe around ~78\u201392, low-frequency spectral concentration, and high endpoints match the F-22 summary and the provided label-5 reference samples extremely well.\\n- Similarity score justification for chosen label: The sample shares the near-identical multi-lobe low-frequency shape, matching time-locations, comparable amplitudes for mid peaks (~+0.6 to +0.9), low volatility inside lobes, and the same STFT/SHAP pattern seen in the label-5 reference examples. Thus I assign a high similarity score of 4 (High similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- The four similar reference examples (Samples 98, 12, 15, 74) are all labelled 5 and their plots, STFTs and SHAP maps strongly resemble the test sample: same start-high \u2192 deep early trough \u2192 mid positive hump(s) \u2192 later trough \u2192 final rise; their SHAP maps concentrate red in the lowest-frequency rows in the same mid windows. This confirms the classifier uses the same mid-window slow lobes to identify the F-22 pattern. The dissimilar examples (labels 4 shown) have a very different central morphology (a single very large symmetric central peak and different SHAP/frequency signatures) and therefore are inconsistent with the test sample. The match to label 5 is consistent across raw time-series shape, STFT low-frequency concentration, and SHAP attribution patterns.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 5 (F-22) with similarity score = 4 (high similarity).\"\n    ]\n}",

There are repeated broad peaks/troughs rather than many rapid cycles.\",\n    \"- Volatility: Low volatility within the broad lobes (smooth ramps). Localized small-amplitude high-frequency wiggles appear near ~64\u201370 but are low power (seen in the plot and weak in STFT). These higher-frequency components have little positive SHAP weight.\",\n    \"- Temporal dependence & combination: The classifier (per SHAP) is combining evidence from multiple separated low-frequency lobes \u2014 chiefly the mid primary hump and the supporting mid/late hump \u2014 plus the endpoint rise. The order matters: an early drop (t=0\u219220) followed by mid broad hump(s) then late trough then final rise constitutes the recognizable signature.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label descriptions and selection:\",\n    \"- Compare with the provided label feature summaries: The sample's dominant characteristics (start high, broad low-frequency mid hump around 36\u201370, a secondary hump ~78\u201392, deep trough near ~115 and final strong rise to +2.7) match very closely the pattern described for label 5 (F-22).

I use those time windows to inspect the raw trace and STFT.\\n- Primary red window (\u2248t=36\u201378): In the raw trace this is the dominant low-frequency hump: the series climbs from a negative valley around t\u224836 (\u2248-0.9) up to a clear local maximum near t\u224850\u201356 (\u2248+0.7 to +0.9) and then declines slowly afterward. Amplitude of this hump is \u22481.6\u20131.8 peak-to-trough. The rise into the peak is relatively steep for a low-frequency feature (roughly +1.6 over ~18\u201320 steps \u2192 avg slope \u2248 +0.08\u20130.09 units/step), the fall is somewhat slower and smooth. Volatility inside the hump is low (no high-frequency spikes), and STFT shows concentrated energy at the lowest frequency bins during this window \u2014 consistent with a broad, slowly-varying contour bulge.\\n- Secondary red window (\u2248t=78\u201396): The trace shows another broad positive lobe centered near t\u224882\u201392 (amplitude \u2248+0.6\u20130.8) preceded and followed by negative dips. This lobe is lower amplitude than the primary hump, also smooth and low-volatility. SHAP marks the lowest-frequency rows positive here as well; STFT again indicates the energy is at very low frequencies (slightly weaker than the main hump).\\n- Additional supportive red at edges (weak): The series starts very positive (t=0 \u2248 +2.7) and ends very positive (t\u2248143 \u2248 +2.7). STFT shows low-frequency energy at the edges and SHAP has small positive low-frequency attribution there \u2014 these endpoint bulges are supportive but less central than the mid-sequence lobes.\\n- Negligible high-frequency contribution: STFT confirms higher-frequency rows carry little energy in the red-marked windows; the SHAP map also shows little-to-no positive attribution at mid/high frequencies. Short, small-amplitude wiggles (near troughs) produce little SHAP weight and are not driving the classification.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and relationships between features:\\n- Global structure: The series is dominated by slow, low-frequency multimodal undulations (quasi-periodic broad lobes) across the 144 points: an initial large positive level, a deep early trough (around t\u224820\u201325, \u2248-1.4), a primary mid positive hump (t\u224836\u201360, \u2248+0.7\u20130.9), a secondary mid/late hump (t\u224878\u201392, \u2248+0.6\u20130.8), a deep trough near t\u2248115 (\u2248-1.6), and a large terminal rise to \u2248+2.7. This produces an envelope with 2\u20133 broad cycles across the sequence.\\n- Frequency / volatility: Energy is concentrated in the lowest STFT bins during the main events; inside these events volatility is low (smooth monotonic rise/fall). Localized faster transitions (e.g., descent into troughs) have modest mid-frequency energy but these are not strongly attributed positively by SHAP.\\n- Temporal dependence: The classifier appears to care about the ordering and relative amplitudes of these broad lobes \u2014 a deep early trough followed by a strong mid hump and then a supporting later hump, plus large endpoint bulges \u2014 because SHAP highlights these exact low-frequency windows. The mid hump is the strongest single cue, the later hump and endpoint bulges provide reinforcing evidence.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries: comparison and selection\\n- Label 5 (F-22) summary (from provided library): dominant low-frequency primary hump roughly centered ~36\u201370 with amplitude ~+0.8, repeated lower-amplitude lobes later, edge positives also present; STFT energy concentrated at very low frequencies; SHAP positive at lowest-frequency rows in mid windows. This matches the sample closely: the sample's primary hump timing, amplitude (~+0.7\u20130.9), secondary hump near ~80\u201392, low-frequency STFT energy and SHAP pattern, and positive endpoints correspond directly to the described F-22 signature.\\n- Other labels (brief contrasts):\\n  - Label 0 (Mirage), Label 1 (Eurofighter), Label 2 (F-14 closed), Label 3 (F-14 opened), Label 4 (Harrier), Label 6 (F-15) have their own characteristic patterns (e.g., some emphasize troughs at different positions, stronger asymmetries, or other timing). The provided label-4 (Harrier) and label-2/3 (F-14 variations) patterns typically show different timing or amplitude distributions (and the dissimilar reference examples provided are centered on a large single peak around the middle with different SHAP mid/high frequency patterns). In particular, the dissimilar samples (label 4) show stronger single central peaks at different absolute time positions and have SHAP distributions across more frequencies; they do not match the dual mid-lobe + endpoint bulges pattern seen here.\\n- Therefore the best-matching label is label 5 (F-22). I assign a high similarity score (4/4) because: (a) the temporal locations of the main positive low-frequency attributions align with the F-22 description; (b) amplitudes and asymmetries of the primary and secondary lobes are almost identical to the reference F-22 examples; (c) STFT & SHAP frequency localization match the F-22 pattern (strong lowest-frequency energy, little high-frequency positive attribution).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference examples provided:\\n- The four 'similar' reference samples are all labeled 5 and show near-identical trace shapes: large positive endpoints, deep early trough, primary mid hump around t\u224836\u201370 at \u2248+0.7\u20130.9, a secondary hump near t\u224878\u201392, low STFT energy concentrated at lowest bins in the same windows, and SHAP positive concentrated at low frequencies in the mid windows. Sample 25's trace, STFT and SHAP are visually and quantitatively consistent with those reference examples.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' provided examples (label 4) show different mid-sequence behavior (a single very large central peak at different positions and broader SHAP activity across more frequency rows), confirming that sample 25 is not similar to those labels.\\n- Taken together the internal consistency checks (raw trace \u2194 STFT \u2194 SHAP \u2194 reference samples \u2194 label descriptions) all point to label 5 with high confidence.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 5 (F-22).

STFT shows elevated energy confined to the lowest frequency rows during this window, confirming this is a slow (low-frequency) bulge.\",\n    \"- Window B (\u224862\u201388): After the first mid-peak the series falls modestly (to about -0.4 to -0.8 near t\u224866\u201370) then rises again to another broad hump peaking around t\u224884\u201388 at \u2248+0.7\u2013+0.8. This second mid-lobe is also low-volatility, low-frequency, and has an ascent/descent structure similar in scale to Window A (magnitudes ~1.0\u20131.6 units; slopes on ascents \u2248 +0.10\u2013+0.20). The SHAP low-frequency positive block overlaps this interval, so the classifier treats this repeated broad hump structure as positive evidence.\",\n    \"- Window C (\u224898\u2013106): A smaller positive attribution corresponds to a modest upward transient near t\u2248100\u2013105 where the series briefly returns toward small positive values (~0 to +0.2).

Frequency/volatility summary for local features: The positively attributed regions are dominated by very-low-frequency content (STFT energy in the bottom rows) and are smooth (low volatility).

Periodicity & substructure: There is a repeating low-frequency pattern of broad peaks roughly every 20\u201335 steps (e.g., trough near 24, hump ~55, hump ~84, trough ~115). The mid-sequence contains two clear broad positive lobes separated by a trough \u2014 an important ordered sequence (small trough \u2192 hump \u2192 trough \u2192 hump) that the model emphasizes.\",\n    \"2.3.

Temporal dependence and combination: The classifier appears to combine multiple separated low-frequency bulges in the mid region additively; the presence of two broad mid-humps at those specific relative positions (and their asymmetric rise/fall shapes) yields strong positive evidence.

There is very little positive SHAP at mid/higher frequencies. STFT confirms most energy for those times lies in the bottom frequency bins (< ~0.05 normalized), i.e. broad/slow components.\\n- Corresponding raw-time manifestations (detailed):\\n  * t\u22480\u201325 (context window): the series starts high (~+2.7 at t=0) and falls steeply to the early trough near t\u224822\u201326 (\u2248 -1.4 to -1.6). Change rate ~ -0.15 to -0.2 units/step across the first ~15\u201325 steps; volatility is low (smooth monotonic descent).

Values climb from roughly ~ -0.8/ -0.6 up to a local peak ~+0.8 (peak around t\u224854\u201366). The ascent is relatively brisk on the local scale (approx +0.08\u2013+0.12 units/step across ~10\u201315 steps), then a smoother descent. Volatility within the lobe is low (no sharp spikes). STFT: concentrated low-frequency energy; SHAP: deep red at the bottom rows \u2014 this lobe is the single strongest positive driver for classification.\\n  * t\u224866\u201384 (secondary positive region): after the main lobe there's a descent then another broad rise to a secondary hump around t\u224878\u201388 (~+0.6\u2013+0.75) followed by a fall. This secondary broad hump also shows low-frequency energy and positive SHAP (though weaker than the main 48\u201366 block).

Lobes are smooth (low volatility) while transitions can have modestly increased slope.\\n- Volatility & frequency: low volatility inside broad events, occasional small high-frequency micro-oscillations (ignored by the classifier). STFT/SHAP confirm the classifier emphasizes long-wavelength (very-low-frequency) structure and penalizes mid-frequency sharpness.\\n- Temporal dependence: classifier appears to use ordering and relative timing of the mid-sequence main hump (t\u224848\u201366) followed by a second hump (\u224878\u201388) and the final endpoint rise; the presence, amplitudes, and positions of these lobes combine additively to produce a strong positive attribution.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 match to label patterns (which label description best contains these features?):\\n- Label 5 (F-22) summary: describes a dominant broad positive hump ~t\u224836\u201370 as the primary discriminative feature, a secondary smaller broad hump later (~78\u201392), and large endpoint amplitudes \u2014 plus low-frequency dominance and little positive attribution to high-frequency jitter.

Overall similar behavior but the characteristic mid-time two-lobe pattern and endpoint amplitude in our sample align better with label 5. => Moderate similarity at best.\\n  * Label 1 (Eurofighter): relies on a dominant asymmetric mid-cycle but with a different rise/fall asymmetry (slower build, faster decay) and less emphasis on the exact mid-hump positions seen here; also Eurofighter examples down-weight large terminal rises. => Low-to-moderate similarity.\\n  * Label 2 & 3 (F-14 closed/open): emphasize strong troughs at particular early or late windows and multiple wide troughs; their characteristic patterns (especially wings-open/closed timing) differ from the mid-hump-dominated signature of this sample. => Low similarity.\\n  * Label 4 (Harrier): central dominant hump is present in Harrier, but Harrier's main hump tends to be a very high amplitude single mid bump with different pre/post trough contrasts and timings (and more negative contribution elsewhere). Our sample has the mid hump but also a clear secondary hump and large endpoint symmetry which match label 5 better. => Low-to-moderate similarity.\\n  * Label 6 (F-15): shows persistent low-frequency envelope across middle with twin peaks and penalizes sharp mid-frequency transitions; some resemblance exists, but label 6 examples tend to emphasize a more continuous low-frequency envelope across many windows rather than the clearly localized main + secondary lobes concentrated near t\u224848\u201390. => Moderate similarity.\\n\\n(Quantified similarity scores per label for transparency \u2014 scale 1\u20134):\\n- label 0: 2 (low\u2013moderate) \u2014 some low-frequency multi-lobe resemblance but timing/amplitude alignment weaker.\\n- label 1: 2 (low) \u2014 shares low-frequency mid-cycle idea but different timing/asymmetry and weaker endpoint role.\\n- label 2: 1 (no/weak) \u2014 pattern of F-14 closed (early troughs/particular late troughs) does not align well.\\n- label 3: 1 (no/weak) \u2014 F-14 wings-open timing/shape differs substantively.\\n- label 4: 2 (low) \u2014 Harrier has a large mid bump but sample shows an extra supporting secondary hump and endpoint symmetry more typical of label 5.\\n- label 5: 4 (high) \u2014 near-complete match: primary mid hump around t\u224836\u201370, secondary hump later, strong low-frequency energy, and large endpoint amplitudes (the SHAP+STFT+time-series all match the label-5 profile and the provided similar training examples).\\n- label 6: 2 (low\u2013moderate) \u2014 shares low-frequency emphasis but not the same concentrated mid-hump + secondary-lobe arrangement.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 cross-check with reference samples and final decision:\\n- The provided four similar reference samples are all labeled 5 and visually/structurally match test-sample 39: main mid hump around the same time window, secondary hump later, low-frequency STFT energy at the bottom rows, and large start/end amplitudes. Their SHAP heatmaps also show the same bottom-row red concentration in the mid windows. This reinforces the high-match judgment.\\n- The two dissimilar reference samples (labels 4 in the set) display different mid/late timing and more varied SHAP patterns (more mid-frequency activity and different red/blue distributions) than our test-sample, supporting the conclusion that label 4 is not a close match.\\n\\nConclusion & final classification: label 5 (F-22). Rationale: strong alignment between the test sample's mid-sequence dominant low-frequency hump (t\u224848\u201366), secondary hump (\u224878\u201388), low volatility inside lobes, strong low-frequency energy in STFT, SHAP bottom-row red attribution at same times, and large endpoint amplitudes \u2014 all match the label-5 description and reference examples.

The end segment (t\u2248120\u2013143) contains a large, smooth upward sweep from \u2248 -1.5 to \u2248 +2.7 (fast relative slope near the very end but energy concentrated at low frequency) and is weakly positively attributed in SHAP.\",\n    \"\u2022 STFT confirmation: the STFT image shows elevated energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins during the mid-window (~36\u201380) and near the sequence ends. Higher-frequency bands show little energy in the red-attributed regions.

STFT and SHAP both concentrate energy/importance at the lowest frequency rows, indicating that the discriminative signal is large-scale contour structure (broad peaks/troughs) rather than short spikes.\",\n    \"\u2022 Number & spacing of lobes: there are multiple broad oscillations: an early large descent into a trough (~0\u201322), then two main mid-sequence positive lobes (~48\u201358 and ~78\u201386) separated by dips, a mid-late modest positive excursion near ~100, a deep trough around ~110\u2013120, and a large terminal rise to a high endpoint. Lobes are asymmetric (rises and falls show different slopes) but are smooth within each lobe.\",\n    \"\u2022 Volatility & change rates: volatility is low inside lobes (smooth monotonic ramps). The steepest local slopes are the early descent (start \u2192 trough) and the final climb (t\u2248120\u2192143). Some transitions (e.g., fall after the first mid-peak) are moderately faster and correspond to small mid-frequency content in STFT but overall high-frequency energy is small.\",\n    \"\u2022 Temporal dependence / ordering: the mid-sequence pattern (small hump \u2192 larger hump \u2192 dip \u2192 secondary hump) and the position of the early trough and final rise form a temporal signature \u2014 the order matters and SHAP concentrates where those slow lobes occur. The model therefore uses both amplitude and temporal ordering of broad contour components.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and selection of label:\",\n    \"\u2022 Comparison to label_5 (F-22) summary: label_5\u2019s reference description emphasizes a dominant mid-sequence broad positive hump around ~36\u201370, a secondary positive lobe later (~78\u201392), and large positive endpoints.

I rate the similarity to label_5 as high (4/4) because both the waveform morphology (mid broad hump + supporting hump + endpoint amplitudes) and the SHAP/STFT emphasis on lowest frequencies align closely with the label_5 description and the four provided label_5 reference samples.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Verification with reference samples and dissimilar samples:\",\n    \"\u2022 Check against the four provided 'similar' references (samples labelled 5): Each of those references has the same overall anatomy: high positive start, deep early trough, a mid-window primary hump (~50\u201360) and a second mid hump (~78\u201390), trough around ~116, and strong terminal rise. Their STFTs show concentrated energy at the very lowest frequencies in the same mid windows, and their SHAP heatmaps have strong low-frequency red exactly where the current sample does.

The test sample does not share that dominant single-center-peak morphology and its SHAP map concentrates on the low-frequency bands earlier/later, so labels 4 are less consistent. This supports rejecting labels 4 and others.\",\n    \"\u2022 Fairness & scoring logic: given the near one-to-one match of waveform morphology, timing of lobes, amplitude levels and the alignment of SHAP low-frequency positive areas with label_5\u2019s canonical discriminative windows, assigning the highest similarity score (4/4) is consistent and fair.

There are weaker low-frequency positive patches around ~78\u2013104 and little-to-no strong positive attribution at the very end (130\u2013143) in this sample.\",\n    \"2) Map to the time series and describe precisely:\",\n    \"  - Main positive block (\u224836\u201378): In the raw trace this corresponds to a broad, low-frequency positive lobe that begins with a smooth rise from near -0.9 (\u224836\u201340) up to a local maximum \u2248+0.9 (\u224852\u201360), followed by a gradual fall back toward slightly negative values by \u224870. Amplitude: the hump is roughly 1.6\u20131.8 units peak-to-trough within that window. Volatility: low within the lobe (smooth single-cycle shape, few fast oscillations). Change rate: the ascent is noticeably steeper than small subsequent fluctuations (moderate positive slope on the rise, gentler decline). Substructure: the hump has a clear asymmetric shape (relatively brisk rise \u2192 broad peak \u2192 slower descent). STFT confirms energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins during this interval, matching the low-frequency SHAP attribution.\",\n    \"  - Supporting low-frequency patches (~78\u2013104): The SHAP map shows weaker but present positive attribution at low frequency here. In the time series this matches a smaller positive excursion (a second, lower-amplitude hump near ~78\u201392 with amplitude \u2248+0.6\u20130.8) and then a descent. This secondary lobe is lower magnitude and gives weaker positive evidence.\",\n    \"  - Other notable features not strongly SHAP-attributed: The large initial high value at t\u22480 (\u2248+2.8) and the pronounced terminal rise (\u2248130\u2013143 to +2.7\u2013+2.8) are visible in the trace, but SHAP shows only weak attribution there (the classifier in this explanation did not rely heavily on those endpoints). Similarly there are deep troughs around t\u224815\u201326 and t\u2248110\u2013120, which are low-frequency and relatively wide; these are present but the main SHAP emphasis is on the mid-segment lobes described above.\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Global / overall feature analysis:\",\n    \"1) Trend & periodicity: The series displays slow, quasi-periodic low-frequency undulations across the 144 points: a high start, an early deep trough (~15\u201325), then a sequence of broad lobes (mid hump \u224852\u201366, secondary hump \u224878\u201392), later trough and final rise. These undulations are separated by dozens of steps (long periods) and form a coherent global envelope rather than rapid oscillations.\",\n    \"2) Frequency / volatility: STFT shows most spectral energy located in the lowest-frequency bins during the mid windows highlighted by SHAP, indicating the signal is dominated by slow components. Local volatility is low inside the broad lobes (smooth ramps), with occasional small high-frequency ripples around troughs that the SHAP map treats as neutral/weak. Some steeper transitions (e.g., early drop near t=0\u201318 and final climb near t=130\u2013143) create somewhat larger local slopes, but the classifier explanation emphasizes the slow mid-segment lobes.\",\n    \"3) Temporal dependence & combination: The classifier appears to combine multiple low-frequency lobes in a particular temporal arrangement\u2014especially the mid primary hump then a secondary mid-late hump\u2014to form positive evidence. That ordering (primary mid hump followed by supporting hump) is exactly what SHAP highlights, indicating the model values both timing and amplitude of broad contour segments rather than isolated spikes.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Compare with label feature summaries and pick best match:\",\n    \"I compared the sample's detailed features to the provided per-label summaries above.\",\n    \"  - Label 5 (F-22): The label-5 description emphasizes a dominant mid-sequence broad positive hump ~36\u201370 (rise to ~+0.8 then fall), a secondary positive lobe ~78\u201392, low-frequency domination, endpoint high values, and SHAP concentrated at the lowest frequencies in the mid window.

The visual overlay is nearly identical, confirming the model explanation patterns are consistent.\",\n    \"2) Provided dissimilar references (samples 3 and 90 labeled 4) show a different dominant behavior: those have a much larger central peak (near +2.0\u2013+2.6), different distribution of SHAP activations across frequency/time, and different trough/peak ordering. They do not match our sample's moderate-amplitude mid hump and the exact SHAP map. This supports rejecting label 4.\",\n    \"3) Fairness & scoring logic: Based on direct matching of (a) timing of primary discriminative hump (\u224836\u201378), (b) amplitude (~+0.6\u2013+1.0 for the hump, not multi-units like Harrier maxima), (c) SHAP localization to lowest-frequency rows in the mid window, and (d) STFT low-frequency concentration in the same time window, label 5 is the best and most consistent match. The similarity scoring above treats label 5 as '4' (high similarity) and other labels as 2 or 3 where justified (label 6 as 3 because it shares some global low-frequency envelope characteristics but lacks the precise substructure emphasized by label-5 examples).\",\n    \"Final decision: Predicted label = label 5 (F-22).

The STFT confirms elevated energy at the lowest frequency bins during the same windows, so the model's positive attribution is driven by slow/large-scale components in that mid-segment.\\n- Corresponding time-series manifestations and precise local descriptions:\\n  * Time window ~36\u201346: a smooth rise from a small negative/near-zero baseline up to a modest positive local hump (~0.25\u20130.3). Amplitude change \u2248 +0.8 over ~10 steps (moderate slope ~+0.08 per step), low volatility (no high-frequency jitter). STFT: low-frequency energy increases; SHAP: low-frequency rows faint-to-moderately red -> this rising flank is supportive but not the strongest cue.\\n  * Time window ~48\u201362: main mid hump: the series climbs to the principal positive peak in the mid-segment. Peak amplitude ~+0.8\u2013+0.9 around t\u224853\u201356 with a preceding smooth ascent from ~-0.8 (t\u224844) and subsequent smooth descent. The rise is relatively sharp compared to surrounding ramps (approx +1.6 over ~10\u201312 steps, slope ~+0.13\u2013+0.16), but remains low-frequency (broad shape). Volatility inside the hump is low (smooth curvature). STFT: clear concentration at the lowest frequencies in this band; SHAP: strong red at lowest-frequency rows aligned with this peak \u2014 classifier views this broad, asymmetric rise-to-peak as highly positively diagnostic.\\n  * Time window ~66\u201384: a secondary positive excursion (smaller than the primary hump) with a peak \u2248 +0.6\u2013+0.75 around t\u224878\u201382. This is again a low-volatility, broad lobe separated from the earlier hump by a trough; STFT shows low-frequency energy and SHAP gives moderate positive attribution at the lowest-frequency rows. The substructure is: modest rise \u2192 broad plateau/peak \u2192 gradual fall. This repetition of low-frequency lobes reinforces positive evidence.\\n  * Outside these red-attributed mid windows: endpoints (t\u22480 and t\u2248143) show very large positive amplitudes (~+2.7 at both ends). STFT shows low-frequency content near edges, but SHAP there is weak/neutral relative to the mid-window red block \u2014 the model relies mainly on the mid low-frequency lobes for the positive vote.\\n- Frequency/volatility implications: throughout the red windows the STFT indicates energy concentrated at the bottom frequency bins (<~0.05 normalized), and higher frequency bands are weak or neutral in SHAP. Thus the positively attributed features are broad, slowly varying contour lobes (large-scale shape) rather than short, noisy spikes.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and feature combination:\\n- Global trend & endpoints: the series begins very high (~+2.7 at t=0), falls to a deep negative trough (~-1.6 around t\u224820\u201326), then exhibits two or three broad low-frequency lobes across the middle (primary hump near t\u224852\u201356, secondary hump near t\u224878\u201384), followed by a late deep trough (~t\u2248110) and a strong final monotonic rise to a large positive endpoint (~+2.7 at t=143). Endpoints are high and symmetric but not the primary attribution.\\n- Periodicity & temporal spacing: the series displays quasi-periodic low-frequency oscillations with approximate spacing of 25\u201340 time steps between major extrema (trough near 20 \u2192 primary peak near 55 \u2192 secondary peak near ~80 \u2192 trough near 110 \u2192 final rise). This produces most energy in the lowest STFT bins and yields the SHAP positive blocks aligned with those mid-segment lobes.\\n- Volatility: low within the broad lobes (smooth ramps), higher during steeper transitions (e.g., initial fall and later trough-to-rise transitions). Small high-frequency wiggles appear briefly around transition windows (notably between t\u224864\u201370), but these have small STFT magnitude and are not strongly attributed by SHAP (neutral or slightly negative at mid frequencies).\\n- Feature combination & dependence: the classifier appears to combine evidence additively from multiple separated low-frequency lobes in the mid-sequence. The strongest positive contribution is the principal mid hump (\u224848\u201362). The secondary mid-lobe (\u224866\u201384) and the overall pattern of trough\u2192broad hump\u2192trough\u2192hump\u2192final rise further reinforce the class score. Order/phase matters \u2014 the mid-segment broad rise-to-peak followed by another supporting lobe is a learned signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label feature summaries and initial label selection:\\n- Which label in the provided summaries best matches these features?\\n  * Label 5 (F-22) feature summary: describes a dominant mid-sequence broad hump between ~36\u201370 with asymmetric steep rise-to-peak, a secondary positive lobe near ~78\u201392, low-frequency concentration, and large positive endpoints. That description aligns very closely with sample 48: the primary mid hump (\u224848\u201362), the secondary mid/late hump (\u224878\u201384), low-frequency STFT concentration, and large positive endpoints. SHAP emphasis at low frequencies in the mid segment also matches label-5 explanation. => High match.\\n  * Label 4 (Harrier) summary: also emphasizes a strong mid-segment hump (\u224852\u201371) with low-frequency energy. Sample 48 shares that mid hump, so there is some similarity; however Harrier descriptions emphasize a single dominant high-amplitude hump (often larger amplitude ~2.0+ in examples) and different surrounding trough structure; sample 48's mid hump amplitude is lower (~0.8\u20130.9) and additional supporting lobes and symmetric endpoints align better with label 5 patterns. => Moderate/low-moderate match.\\n  * Labels 0,1,2,3,6: many emphasize low-frequency lobes too, but their specific timing, amplitude asymmetries and ordering differ (e.g., label0 emphasizes trough at t\u224825\u2192smooth rise and late large final rise but also other distinct lobes; label1 emphasizes an asymmetric mid-cycle but places less weight on endpoint symmetry; label2 and label3 have characteristic deep troughs or multiple trough/peak placements unlike sample 48; label6 emphasizes persistent low-frequency envelope but with specific penalization of mid-frequency bursts). Overall these labels share the general low-frequency emphasis but do not match the exact combination (mid hump + supporting secondary lobe + large symmetric endpoints) as well as label 5. => Low to moderate match.\\n- Initial classification: label 5 (F-22) is the best match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against the provided reference samples and final scoring justification:\\n- The four 'similar' reference plots supplied are all labeled 5 and visually extremely close to sample 48: they show the same sequence of a deep early trough (near t\u224820\u201326), a dominant mid hump centered \u224850\u201360, a secondary mid-late hump \u224878\u201390, and large positive endpoints near t=0 and t=143. Their STFTs concentrate energy in the same bottom frequency bins and their SHAP maps highlight the mid-segment low-frequency rows. This strong visual and spectral match validates assigning label 5.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' references are label 4. Those examples indeed contain prominent mid peaks but differ in details (peak amplitude, peak sharpness and the global arrangement of supporting lobes and troughs). Their SHAP maps also tend to show additional mid/high-frequency attributions and different low-frequency patterns; they therefore are less consistent with sample 48 than the label-5 references.\\n- Scoring decision: because the mid-segment dominant hump, the secondary supporting lobe, the STFT low-frequency concentration, the SHAP attribution localization, and the endpoint amplitude pattern all line up closely with the label-5 feature summary and the provided label-5 reference examples, I assign the highest similarity score (4 = high similarity) to label 5.\\n\\nSummary (final answer):\\n- Predicted label: label 5 (F-22).\\n- Justification: sample 48 shows the signature combination described for label 5 \u2014 a dominant mid-sequence low-frequency hump (\u224848\u201362), a secondary supportive low-frequency lobe (\u224878\u201384), low STFT energy concentrated at the bottom frequencies in those windows, and the same additive SHAP positive attribution concentrated at those low-frequency rows \u2014 all matching the label-5 pattern and the provided label-5 reference samples.

These red blocks sit in the bottom frequency rows, indicating the model is awarding positive weight to slow/large-scale components in those time ranges.\\n- Corresponding raw trace events and fine-grained features:\\n  - Early edge (t \u2248 0\u201313): very large positive starting offset (~+2.6 to +2.8). This is a broad, low-frequency level rather than a short spike. STFT shows low-frequency energy at the start but SHAP is not strongly red there (minor positive only).\\n  - Early descent and trough (t \u2248 13\u201326): the trace falls smoothly from near ~+0.0 down to the deep trough around t \u2248 22\u201326 (approx. -1.6 to -1.7). Change rate for this decline is relatively steep for this series (rough drop over ~10\u201315 steps), volatility inside the trough is low (smooth), and STFT energy remains in lowest bands. SHAP shows little positive mass here compared with the mid hump \u2014 the model focuses more on the mid humps.\\n  - Mid primary lobe (t \u2248 36\u201356): the series rises from near 0 up to a clear positive hump centered near t \u2248 50\u201356 (peak \u2248 +0.6 to +0.9). This rise is relatively brisk compared with surrounding ramps (change ~+1.2 over ~10\u201315 steps), low local volatility, and STFT shows concentrated energy in the bottom rows during this window. SHAP is strongly positive at low frequency here, indicating this hump is a primary supporting feature.\\n  - Mid secondary lobe (t \u2248 65\u201380): another broad positive bulge/peak is visible (peak \u2248 +0.6\u20130.8) following a small downward flank; this lobe also shows concentrated low-frequency STFT energy and positive low-frequency SHAP (a bit weaker than the main hump but still clearly positive). The two mid lobes appear as serial low-frequency oscillations (smaller hump then larger hump pattern in time) and are the densest SHAP-positive region overall.\\n  - Mid-to-late small oscillation region (t \u2248 86\u2013104): the plot shows a modest positive bump around t\u2248100 but with reduced amplitude and SHAP attribution; STFT shows smaller low-frequency magnitude here. Volatility rises a little in the transitions (some small higher-frequency ripples), but SHAP remains focused on the lowest bands.\\n  - Late trough and final edge rise (t \u2248 110\u2013143): the series goes down into a deeper trough near t \u2248 110\u2013118 (\u2248 -1.6 to -1.7), then recovers smoothly and climbs to a large positive endpoint at t=143 (~+2.6\u2013+2.8). Low-frequency STFT energy reappears on the final rise and SHAP gives moderate low-frequency positive attribution near the end. The final broad rise is also slow/low-frequency and positively weighted.\\n- Frequency/volatility summary for highlighted windows: across the SHAP-positive windows (mid 36\u201380 and final rise) the STFT shows most signal energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins; higher-frequency rows are weak. Local volatility inside the positive lobes is low (smooth ramps), while transition flanks (declines between lobes) show slightly higher mid-frequency content but these are either neutral or not strongly positively attributed.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and dependence of features:\\n- Global form: The series is dominated by large-scale, low-frequency undulations (an initial high level, an early decline to a broad trough, two mid-sequence broad positive lobes, a later trough, and a final broad rise to a high endpoint). This is a multi-lobe low-frequency envelope rather than a sequence of short spikes.\\n- Periodicity & spacing: The main extrema are separated by ~20\u201340 time steps (early trough \u2248 20\u201326, primary mid hump \u2248 50\u201356, secondary mid hump \u2248 65\u201380, late trough \u2248 110\u2013118, final rise to end). That regular-ish spacing and repeated low-frequency lobes create a recognizable multi-stage contour.\\n- Volatility: Low within lobes, moderate at transition flanks. Small high-frequency ripples appear near some transitions (around t\u224864\u201368 and 86\u201392) but their STFT magnitude is low compared with the dominant 0\u20130.06 Hz band and SHAP gives little positive weight to these higher-frequency components.\\n- Temporal dependence and combination: The classifier\u2019s positive evidence is additive across the mid lobes and the final rise \u2014 the mid two low-frequency bulges (the smaller one followed by a larger one) align in time with the strongest positive SHAP and are therefore jointly decisive. The order (smaller hump then larger hump) and the presence of a strong final rise are both part of the sample\u2019s signature.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to provided label feature summaries (rough matching):\\n- Compare with label 5 (F-22) summary: The label_5 description emphasizes a primary mid-sequence broad positive hump around t\u224836\u201370, a secondary positive lobe later (~78\u201392), and large positive start/end amplitudes. That matches this sample closely: strong low-frequency positive attribution over ~36\u201380, two mid lobes, and large endpoints. STFT & SHAP patterns align with label_5 explanation. => Score: 4 (high similarity).\\n- Quick comparisons with other label summaries (scores reflect similarity 1\u20134):\\n  - label 0 (Mirage): described as dominated by low-frequency energy but with different timing for strong mid positive windows (Mirage emphasis at t\u224813\u201330 and later broad peaks). Our sample\u2019s strongest mid positive evidence is around 36\u201380 and the multi-lobe timing matches label_5 better. => Score: 2 (low similarity).\\n  - label 1 (Eurofighter): has an asymmetric mid-cycle (rise then faster fall) concentrated 39\u201395; some overlap exists (mid-region importance), but Eurofighter notes discount late endpoint rises and stresses a specific small-then-large hump with faster decay. Our sample\u2019s final strong endpoint rise and combination of mid lobes match label_5 more closely. => Score: 2 (low similarity).\\n  - label 2 (F-14 wings closed): also low-frequency multi-stage pattern with troughs and repeated humps but its strong late trough+rapid final rise pattern and the exact timing differ from sample (and SHAP concentration windows differ). Some broad resemblance but not as good as label_5. => Score: 2 (low similarity).\\n  - label 3 (F-14 wings opened): dominated by large negative troughs early/mid and a late large upward swing; there are differences in the sign, timing and prominence of events compared with sample 52. => Score: 2 (low similarity).\\n  - label 4 (Harrier): center-dominant single large mid hump (t\u224852\u201371) is the discriminative feature for Harrier. While our sample has mid humps, it has a clear two-hump mid pattern plus very large start/end amplitudes; the Harrier references show a single dominant asymmetric central bulge and different SHAP distribution. => Score: 1 (no/very low similarity).\\n  - label 6 (F-15): broad low-frequency envelope across long middle region and penalties for sharper mid-frequency transitions. Our sample does show broad low-frequency components, but the precise patterning (the two mid lobes and strong final rise) aligns better with label_5. => Score: 2 (low similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference examples and final verification:\\n- The four similar reference samples (samples labeled 5 in the gallery: sample IDs 10, 93, 98, 15) are visually and spectrally very close to the test sample: same large positive endpoints, same deep early trough near t\u224820\u201326, a clear primary mid hump around t\u224850\u201356 and a secondary mid hump around t\u224878\u201388, STFT low-frequency concentration in the same time bands, and SHAP displays concentrated bottom-row red blocks in the mid windows. Those reference plots are essentially near-clones of the test plot (only tiny amplitude/wiggle differences). This strong resemblance supports label 5 with high confidence.\\n- The two dissimilar reference samples (label 4 examples 3 and 90) show a very different mid-sequence signature: they have a single very large positive central peak near t\u224865 (much larger relative amplitude and different phase) and their SHAP patterns include broader frequency-row activation and different timing. Those do not match the test sample\u2019s two-step mid hump + final edge rise pattern.\\n- Putting everything together (SHAP emphasis on mid low-frequency bands, STFT confirming energy at very low frequencies exactly where SHAP is red, raw time-series shape matching the two mid lobes plus large endpoint amplitudes), the best match by far is label 5 (F-22). The reference label-5 samples are nearly identical, and dissimilar-label references differ noticeably.\\n\\nFinal decision and justification:\\n- Classification: label 5 (F-22). The test sample matches the label_5 feature summary and the provided label-5 reference examples closely: dominant mid-sequence low-frequency hump(s) (primary hump ~36\u201370, secondary hump ~78\u201392), low volatility within lobes, and large positive endpoints \u2014 all present and SHAP-attributed in this sample.\\n- Confidence score for the chosen label: 4 (high similarity) because both spectral (STFT) and attribution (SHAP) align with the label_5 description and the training-set reference examples for label 5 are near identical in shape, timing and frequency content.\\n- Per-label similarity summary used in verification (1\u20134 scale): label_0:2, label_1:2, label_2:2, label_3:2, label_4:1, label_5:4, label_6:2.\\n\\nConclusion: Based on the alignment of the mid-sequence low-frequency positive lobes, STFT low-frequency energy, SHAP low-frequency positive attribution in those same windows, and the very close match to multiple label-5 training examples, the test sample is classified as label 5 (F-22) with high similarity/confidence.\"\n  ]\n}",

Their STFT and SHAP maps show the same concentration of low-frequency energy and concentrated red SHAP in the bottom rows around the mid/late-mid windows. This is a very strong pattern match supporting label 5.\",\n    \"  - Dissimilar checks: the two dissimilar reference samples shown (labels 4.0) have a very large single central peak (t\u224860\u201368) with different SHAP patterns (and different high-frequency content in some windows).

STFT and SHAP both indicate the classifier-focused energy is concentrated at very-low-frequency bins (long-wavelength contour features).\",\n        \"\u2022 Volatility & substructure: volatility is low within broad lobes (smooth ramps). There are localized sharper transitions (moderate slope) between lobes (e.g., the early drop and the final rise are steeper), which show slightly more mid-frequency energy but are not positively attributed.

These red blocks occupy the very-low-frequency band, indicating the model relies on slow, broad waveform components in those windows.\\n- Corresponding time-domain events and fine-grained descriptors (mapped from the red/low-frequency bands):\\n  * Early segment (t\u22480\u201320): the trace starts very high (~+2.8 to +3.0 at t=0) and falls smoothly and monotonically to a deep trough near t\u224818\u201325 (\u2248 -1.1 to -1.4). This is a large-amplitude, low-frequency downward ramp (average negative slope large in magnitude early), low volatility inside the ramp (no fast oscillation). The STFT shows strong energy at the lowest frequencies here, and SHAP gives modest positive weight to low-frequency rows at the beginning \u2014 indicating the early high-to-low baseline is part of the supporting pattern.\\n  * Mid segment (t\u224836\u201378): a slow, broad oscillatory structure with two prominent broad lobes: a rise to modest positive values (peaks ~+0.6 to +0.8 around t\u224855\u201366) separated by a rounded trough at earlier midpoints. These lobes are smooth (low volatility), have moderate slopes on the rising flanks and slower falls, and STFT energy concentrated at the lowest frequencies. The SHAP bottom-row red block is strongest here, so the classifier uses these low-frequency lobes as primary positive evidence.\\n  * Late-mid-to-late segment (t\u224878\u2013115): there is a relatively steep drop from a mid-peak down to a deep trough (around t\u224890\u2013100 amplitude \u2248 -1.2 to -1.4), with the STFT showing some increase in mid-frequency energy during the steeper descent. In the SHAP map most positive attribution remains at the lowest frequency rows while mid-frequency rows show neutral or slightly negative values in places \u2014 matching the model preference for smooth low-frequency structure and penalization of sharper mid-frequency transitions.\\n  * Terminal segment (t\u2248130\u2013143): a large, sustained low-frequency rise from near 0 up to the final peak (~+2.8 to +2.9). STFT again indicates low-frequency energy and SHAP shows modest positive attribution in the very-low-frequency rows near the sequence end.\\n- Summary of local features: the SHAP-positive times correspond to broad, low-frequency bulges and troughs in the time domain (large amplitude, low volatility inside those lobes, gradual slopes for most rises; sharper slopes during certain descents which attract less positive SHAP in mid-frequency rows). The STFT confirms that the energy driving positive SHAP is concentrated at the lowest frequency bins, i.e., broad contour-scale components rather than high-frequency texture.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / overall feature analysis:\\n- Dominant characteristics: The series is dominated by broad, low-frequency undulations across the whole 144 points: a very large initial positive offset and fall (edge bulge), two or three mid-sequence low-frequency lobes (rise/peak then fall), a pronounced mid-late trough, and a final strong terminal rise to a large positive endpoint. Volatility is low within the main lobes (smooth ramps), with a few steeper transitions (notably the drop around t\u224878\u2013100 and the final rise) that inject some mid-frequency energy.\\n- Periodicity & spacing: The large-scale extrema are spaced roughly every ~20\u201340 steps (early peak \u2192 trough around t~18\u201325 \u2192 mid positive lobes around t~50\u201380 \u2192 late trough ~90\u2013105 \u2192 final rise ~130\u2013143). This yields a quasi-periodic low-frequency envelope rather than rapid repeated cycles.\\n- Spectral/attribution interplay: STFT visualizes concentrated energy in the lowest-frequency rows for the windows the SHAP heatmap marks as positive. Mid-frequency bands show small bursts coinciding with steeper transitions; SHAP often assigns neutral or slightly negative values to those mid-frequency bands \u2014 indicating the classifier prefers smooth low-frequency shapes and penalizes sharper, more jagged changes.\\n- Temporal dependence and combination: The model appears to combine multiple separated low-frequency events additively: an early high baseline and deep trough, mid slow lobes, a deep mid-late trough, and a final broad rise each contribute to the overall score. The ordering (the specific sequence of troughs and bulges at those time locations) matters \u2014 the SHAP-positive blocks are not scattered randomly but aligned to the broad contour pattern.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label feature summaries and preliminary label choice:\\n- Compare to provided label summaries:\\n  * Label 6 (F-15) summary key points: strong very-low-frequency energy across much of the middle region; early large positive offset then decline into a trough; twin mid-sequence peaks near ~65 and ~78; a steep drop 78\u2192104 that produces mid-frequency energy (which the model treats as negative), and a pronounced final rise to a large endpoint. This closely matches the test sample: early large positive start, trough early, twin mid peaks ~55\u201378, a steep mid\u2192late descent with mid-frequency content and small negative SHAP, and a large final rise.\\n  * Other labels (0,1,2,3,4,5) also emphasize low-frequency features but differ in the timing, amplitude asymmetry, or which mid/late windows are most diagnostic (e.g., label 4 has a dominant single mid hump ~52\u201371 of very large amplitude; label 1 emphasizes a mid asymmetric cycle ~39\u201395 with a particular small-then-large hump pattern; label 2 and 3 have different trough/peak timing and counts). The test sample\u2019s exact combination (early edge high \u2192 early trough \u2192 twin mid peaks \u2192 steep mid-late drop with mid-frequency content \u2192 final large endpoint rise) aligns best with label 6\u2019s description.\\n- Preliminary label choice: label 6 (F-15) is the closest match based on the timing, number and shape of low-frequency lobes, the model\u2019s attribution pattern (low-frequency red concentrated across the middle and end), and the presence of a penalized steeper descent with some mid-frequency energy.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference examples (provided near neighbors and dissimilar examples):\\n- The provided 4 'similar reference samples' are all labeled 6 and their time-series plots, STFTs and SHAP maps are visually very similar to the test sample: identical initial high starting value, similar trough around t~20, twin mid peaks around t~55\u201380, mid-late troughs and a strong terminal rise; their SHAP maps show red concentrated at the lowest frequency bins in the same mid windows. This empirical neighbourhood check strongly supports label 6 for the test sample.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' reference samples are labeled 4 and show a different prominent signature: a dominant, single very-large mid hump (peak magnitude around 2.5 at ~t\u224865) and different SHAP localization. The test sample lacks that single dominant mid hump and instead shows twin mid lobes plus the particular pattern of early and final large endpoints; its SHAP map and STFT are not consistent with the label-4 prototypes. This reinforces that label 4 is unlikely.\\n- Consistency/fairness check: The scoring logic (matching the detailed temporal positions, amplitudes, slope asymmetries, and the frequency-attribution pattern) is consistent with how the model appears to make decisions (prefers broad low-frequency structure and penalizes mid-frequency sharpness). Since the test sample\u2019s exact combination of features is nearly identical to the label-6 prototypes and neighboring training examples, assigning the highest similarity to label 6 is justified.\\n\\nFinal assignment & similarity quantification:\\n- Final predicted label: label 6 (F-15).\\n- Similarity score (1\u20134) for the chosen label: 4 (high similarity). Rationale: the test sample matches the label-6 feature summary almost exactly in terms of (a) early large positive baseline and early trough, (b) twin mid-sequence low-frequency peaks around the same time range, (c) a steeper mid\u2192late descent that produces some mid-frequency energy (observed and treated neutrally/negatively by SHAP), and (d) a strong terminal low-frequency rise \u2014 all corroborated by STFT and by multiple similar training references labeled 6.\\n\\nAdditional per-label quick similarity notes (used to calibrate the final decision):\\n- label 0: score 2 (shares low-frequency emphasis but timing/shape differs noticeably from the sample)\\n- label 1: score 2 (some mid-window low-frequency activity in label 1 but sequence/asymmetry differs)\\n- label 2: score 2 (has troughs and rises but different timing / pattern of mid/late events)\\n- label 3: score 2 (some early negative swing similarity but overall pattern mismatch)\\n- label 4: score 1 (distinctive single dominant mid hump in label 4 not observed here)\\n- label 5: score 2 (also low-frequency lobes present but amplitude/timing differ)\\n\\nConclusion: After careful local, spectral and attribution analysis and cross-checking against the provided reference examples, the most accurate classification is label 6 (F-15) with high similarity (score = 4).\"\n  ]\n}"

Label_1 matches all three closely \u2014 so '4 = high similarity' is appropriate.

Using the plot and STFT to locate those red areas precisely, the following local events are responsible for the positive attribution:\",\n    \"- Early large baseline and descent (t \u2248 0\u201325): The series starts at a very large positive value (~+2.8 to +2.9 at t=0) then falls smoothly to a deep trough (~-1.2 to -1.4 by t\u224818\u201325). This is a large low-frequency downward swing (low volatility inside the trough). STFT shows strong energy at the lowest frequencies in this interval and the SHAP map gives modest positive weight to the low-frequency rows here. Change rate: the drop is relatively steep initially (average slope ~-0.15 to -0.22 units/step over the fall).\",\n    \"- Mid-sequence double-lobe (t \u2248 36\u201392; strongest SHAP \u2248 52\u201391): In the SHAP red block the classifier is mainly attending to a sequence of slow, broad lobes: a moderate positive hump around t\u224848\u201356 (amplitude \u2248 +0.6 to +0.8), followed by a small dip, then another positive pulse(s) peaking in the t\u224865\u201380 window (amplitudes \u2248 +0.6 to +0.9). These events are smooth (low local volatility), low-frequency (STFT concentrated in the bottom rows at those times), and asymmetric (rise and fall rates differ slightly). The SHAP red is most intense at the lowest frequency bins over this whole mid-region, confirming the model uses slow, large-scale curvature here.\",\n    \"- Mid-to-late trough (t \u2248 86\u2013100): After the mid positive pulses the trace declines to a negative trough roughly around t\u224888\u2013100 (values \u2248 -1.0 to -1.4). The descent into this trough is somewhat faster than the preceding rises and STFT shows a small increase in mid-frequency power during the sharper parts; SHAP still emphasizes the low-frequency band but mid-frequency rows show neutral-to-slightly-negative attribution where the change is sharper.\",\n    \"- Final strong rise (t \u2248 120\u2013143): The end of the sequence exhibits a sustained and relatively steep ascent from about t\u2248125 to the final value at t=143 (~+2.7 to +2.9). STFT indicates low-frequency energy returns here and the SHAP map shows low-frequency positive contribution near the end (though weaker than the mid block). Average slope of the final rise is relatively high (~+0.15 to +0.2 units/step).\",\n    \"These local descriptions are precise and unambiguous because the SHAP red blocks align with the low-frequency STFT energy and the same time ranges in the raw trace; the classifier is clearly relying on broad, slow lobes (not short spikes) in the mid and end windows.\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall feature summary and temporal dependence: The full time series is dominated by large-scale, low-frequency structure: (1) a very large initial positive peak followed by a smooth steep fall into an early trough, (2) a mid-sequence region of ordered broad oscillations (small hump \u2192 larger hump \u2192 trough) occupying roughly t\u224836\u201392, and (3) a pronounced terminal rise to another very large endpoint. Volatility is low inside the broad lobes and higher only during the sharper transitions (e.g., the early fall and some mid-to-late descents). The STFT confirms most of the signal power relevant to classification resides in the lowest frequency bins during the SHAP-positive windows. Temporally, the classifier weights multiple separated low-frequency features additively \u2014 the mid double-lobe and the terminal rise together strengthen the positive attribution. The series therefore has quasi-periodic, long-period oscillations (broad peaks/troughs spaced by tens of time steps) rather than high-frequency repeated cycles.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Matching to label feature summaries (per-label similarity judgement): I compared the test-sample's local and global features to the seven label summaries provided. Short conclusions and scores (1\u20134):\",\n    \"- label 0 (Mirage): Score = 2. Reason: Mirage description emphasizes several low-frequency lobes but often with a different temporal arrangement and particularly strong mid/end low-frequency peaks in different positions. Some low-frequency traits match, but the mid double-hump + terminal large endpoint pattern of the test sample is not the best match.\",\n    \"- label 1 (Eurofighter): Score = 3. Reason: Eurofighter summary focuses on a distinctive mid-window low-frequency asymmetric cycle (small hump then larger hump then fast fall) centered about the mid-sequence \u2014 this is similar to the test sample's mid double-lobe. However Eurofighter descriptions often downplay the importance of the large terminal rise, while the test sample has a very prominent final bulge which in this sample carries positive SHAP. So similarity is moderate but not the highest.\",\n    \"- label 2 (F-14 wings closed): Score = 2.

Reason: Multiple separated low-frequency negative lobes are described there, but the sign/timing and the mid double-lobe + terminal bulge pattern of the test sample differ substantially.\",\n    \"- label 4 (Harrier): Score = 2.

Not a close match.\",\n    \"- label 5 (F-22): Score = 2. Reason: F-22 has a primary hump around ~36\u201370 and smaller supporting lobes, so there is some similarity, but F-22 mid hump often has slightly different shape/slope characteristics and the strong initial/final endpoints here better match label 6 descriptions.\",\n    \"- label 6 (F-15): Score = 4. Reason: The label-6 summary describes a very similar pattern: strong very-low-frequency mass spanning roughly t\u224813\u2013104 (with particularly strong contributions around t\u224865\u201391), twin broad peaks around mid-sequence (peaks near ~65 and ~78), and a pronounced large positive endpoint. The SHAP map described for label 6 (positive in the lowest-frequency rows across the same mid region, penalization of sharper mid-frequency bursts) matches the test sample's SHAP. The test sample's STFT and raw trace align closely with the label-6 prototype and with multiple provided reference examples labeled 6 (see Step 4). Therefore label 6 is the best match.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples (consistency check): Four \u2018similar\u2019 reference samples are shown and all are labeled 6 in the provided references (samples 19, 13, 23, 35). Visually those four references are nearly identical in global shape to the test sample: identical large initial value, similar early descent into a trough, very similar mid double-peak structure (~50\u201380 window) and the same strong final rise to ~+2.9. Their STFTs show low-frequency energy concentrated in the same time windows and their SHAP heatmaps highlight the lowest-frequency rows in the same mid region \u2014 matching the test sample precisely. Two \u2018dissimilar\u2019 reference examples labeled 4 show a single dominant mid peak and different SHAP/frequency signatures; those differ visibly from the test sample. The nearest-neighbor references therefore confirm the test sample best matches label 6 both in raw waveform, STFT, and SHAP attribution.\",\n    \"Final decision: The most accurate classification is label 6 (F-15). Similarity score for this chosen label is high (4), justified by near-identity of waveform structure, overlapping STFT low-frequency energy locations, matching SHAP positive-band timing, and multiple training examples (provided similar references) that are essentially the same shape and labeled 6.

These low-frequency rows are the ones the model used positively.\\n- Corresponding time-series windows and fine-grained features:\\n  * Early window (t \u2248 0 \u2192 20): The series starts at a very large positive value (~+2.8 to +2.9 at t=0) and exhibits a smooth, mostly monotonic decline to a wide trough around t\u224818\u201326 with amplitude \u2248 -1.2 to -1.4. Volatility inside that descent is low (gentle slope overall but fairly steep compared to later ramps); STFT energy at this time is concentrated at the lowest frequency bin and SHAP shows modest positive attribution here \u2014 the model treats this early decline + trough as supportive baseline evidence.\\n  * Mid window 1 (t \u2248 36 \u2192 56): There is a smooth low-frequency rise from near-zero/negative values up to a moderate positive local peak (~+0.6 to +0.8). The rise is relatively smooth with low within-window volatility (no large high-frequency spikes). SHAP red is strong at the lowest-frequency rows here and STFT confirms most power is in the bottom bins \u2014 this slow hump is a clear positive cue.\\n  * Mid window 2 (t \u2248 60 \u2192 84): A second broad positive excursion follows, peaking around the mid-60s to late-70s at roughly +0.7 to +0.9. The pair of mid peaks are separated by a modest dip/trough and together form two low-frequency lobes. Volatility inside the lobes is low; transitions between them show slightly elevated mid-frequency content (small ripples) but those higher-frequency components are weak relative to the DC/very-low-frequency energy. SHAP shows sustained red at the bottom rows during these lobes indicating the model strongly favors these large-scale bulges.\\n  * Late-mid trough (t \u2248 88 \u2192 105): After the mid lobes the series falls to a deeper trough (around t\u224895\u2013105) with amplitude near -1.2 to -1.4. The descent here is somewhat quicker than the rises, and STFT shows a modest increase in mid-frequency energy during the faster change; SHAP still attributes positively at the lowest frequencies to the overall slow trough/shape.\\n  * Terminal window (t \u2248 125 \u2192 143): There is a pronounced final rise beginning ~t=125 and ending at the sequence end (~t=143) at a high positive amplitude (~+2.8 to +2.9). STFT again shows low-frequency dominance here, and SHAP gives modest positive attribution at the low-frequency rows \u2014 a large terminal bulge is supportive of the label.\\n- Shape and change-rate details: The positively attributed events are broad, low-frequency lobes (wide peaks and troughs lasting tens of steps) with low intra-lobe volatility. Rise rates in supportive lobes are moderate (typical average slopes ~+0.05 to +0.2 units/step depending on the segment) and declines (where present) can be steeper. Small, higher-frequency wiggles occur chiefly during transitions and are either neutral or slightly negative in SHAP, so they are not drivers of the classification.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Global / overall feature summary and time-dependence:\\n- Overall trend & periodicity: The series is dominated by a slow quasi-periodic envelope: a large positive start, a deep early trough, two mid-sequence broad positive lobes, a later deep trough, and a final strong rise to a high endpoint. This yields roughly 2\u20133 low-frequency half-cycles across the 144 timesteps. The dominant spectral energy is in the very-low-frequency bins (STFT bright at bottom rows during major events), consistent with SHAP attribution.\\n- Volatility profile: Low volatility inside the main lobes (smooth ramps and plateaus). Relatively higher volatility (more mid-frequency energy) appears during the steeper transitions (for example falling from a mid peak into a trough), but those mid-frequency bursts are either neutral or slightly negative in SHAP \u2014 the classifier penalizes sharp, high-frequency texture and favors smooth broad curvature.\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: The model appears to combine several temporally-ordered low-frequency events (early high \u2192 early trough \u2192 mid twin-lobes \u2192 late trough \u2192 terminal rise). The presence, amplitude and relative timing of these broad features (especially the mid twin lobes and the final endpoint rise) jointly push the classifier toward the positive label attribution observed in the SHAP map. The ordering (early trough prior to mid lobes, repeated low-frequency lobes, then final rise) is important \u2014 the classifier treats these as a sequence-signature rather than isolated spikes.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to provided label summaries (select best label and provide relative similarities):\\n- Quick mapping: The sample\u2019s signature (early large positive baseline followed by a deep early trough, then two broad mid-sequence positive lobes separated by a modest dip, a later trough, and a large terminal rise; all dominated by very low-frequency energy) closely matches the label_6 (F-15) description in the provided summaries. Label_6 explicitly lists: pronounced early positive offset, trough near t\u224813\u201326, twin positive pulses around t\u224852\u201378, a deep mid-late trough and a final terminal rise \u2014 the same sequence we see in the test sample.\\n- Comparative similarity scoring (1\u20134) vs. each label (based on the textual summaries and the reference examples):\\n  * label 0 (Mirage): 2 \u2014 shares low-frequency dominance in parts, but Mirage summaries emphasize a different timing of the main positive lobes (a distinctive mid-window pattern centered at different times and slightly different asymmetry); overall only a weak partial match.\\n  * label 1 (Eurofighter): 3 \u2014 Eurofighter summary emphasizes a dominant mid-segment asymmetric cycle (small hump then larger hump ~39\u201395) which is somewhat similar to our twin mid-lobes; however the detailed early trough / final rise pattern and exact phasing aligns slightly better with label_6.\\n  * label 2 (F-14 wings closed): 2 \u2014 has multiple low-frequency events but the timing/arrangement described for label_2 differs (and the strongest attributions are at different time blocks); moderate-to-low match.\\n  * label 3 (F-14 wings opened): 2 \u2014 also low-frequency dominated but its specific pattern of troughs/peaks and the shapes described differ from the twin mid-lobes + final strong rise pattern here.\\n  * label 4 (Harrier): 1 \u2014 Harrier descriptions emphasize a single dominant mid hump (trough-to-peak rise, then descent) with a different shape/asymmetry; the test sample shows repeated mid lobes rather than one dominant hump, so match is poor.\\n  * label 5 (F-22): 2 \u2014 F-22 has a dominant broad hump around mid-sequence and supporting lobes / endpoint amplitudes, but the multi-lobe, twin mid-peak structure plus the specific early trough and final terminal rise is a closer match to label_6.\\n  * label 6 (F-15): 4 \u2014 High similarity. The textual label_6 description explicitly lists the same combination: large early positive offset, a deep trough near the start, two low-frequency mid peaks (around the mid 60s\u201380s region), a deeper trough later, and a pronounced final rise to a large endpoint. The STFT + SHAP pattern (strong red in the lowest frequency rows across the same time blocks) is also described in label_6's summary. The four retrieved similar reference samples are all labeled 6 and look visually and spectrally nearly identical to the test sample, reinforcing this match.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference examples and final verification:\\n- Reference-sample verification: The four 'similar' reference samples included with the problem are all labeled 6 and their plots, STFTs and SHAP maps match the test sample in: (a) early high start followed by a large early trough, (b) two mid-sequence low-frequency lobes, (c) later trough followed by a terminal rise, (d) STFT energy concentrated at the lowest frequency rows for the same time blocks, and (e) SHAP red concentrated at those same low-frequency rows. That strong visual/spectral/attribution concordance with multiple labeled-6 examples provides robust additional evidence that the model learned the F-15 (label 6) signature and is applying it to the test sample.\\n- Dissimilar references check: The two dissimilar examples (label 4) contain a single very strong central hump and different SHAP localization; they therefore do not match the test-sample multi-lobe pattern, which supports rejecting label 4.\\n- Fairness and scoring logic: Given the textual label summaries, the STFT and SHAP attribution alignment, and multiple labeled-6 reference samples that are near-identical in time-domain shape and time-frequency attribution, the highest-confidence assignment is label 6. The similarity rating for label 6 is 4 (high). Labels 1 and 5 have moderate resemblance (raw low-frequency mid-hump features) so they were scored lower (3 and 2 respectively in the step-by-step comparison). Labels emphasizing a single central hump or different phasing (labels 0,2,3,4) have lower similarity.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 6 (F-15). Score (for chosen label): 4 (high similarity).\"\n    ]\n}"

Labels 0\u20134 (Mirage, Eurofighter, F-14 open/closed, Harrier) show different dominant patterns in the summaries (e.g., Harrier has a single very large mid hump ~t=52\u201371 which is asymmetric and quite prominent) and the dissimilar reference samples for label 4 indeed show that large single central peak pattern which is not present here. Therefore label_6 is the best match. Preliminary similarity rating to label_6: high.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification: The four provided \\\"similar\\\" training references (samples 50, 91, 49, 35) are all labeled 6 and their plots, STFTs and SHAP maps are visually nearly identical to the test sample: same early high start, deep early trough, twin/successive mid low-frequency lobes, later trough, final rise, and SHAP concentrated in the bottom frequency rows across essentially the same time windows. The two provided \\\"dissimilar\\\" examples (labels 4) show a single dominant central peak (large amplitude ~+2.5 at mid times) and different SHAP distribution \u2014 they do not match the multiple low-frequency lobes & troughs ordering observed in the test sample. This comparison confirms the model\u2019s attention (SHAP) and the STFT spectral content are consistent across the sample and the label_6 references. The negative/neutral mid-frequency SHAP pockets seen during rapid transitions are also consistent with label_6 descriptions which penalize sharp mid-frequency content. Given these points, classification as label 6 is robust.\",\n    \"Final classification and confidence score: label 6 (F-15) with high similarity score = 4 (high similarity).

      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 6\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local (red SHAP) feature inspection and fine-grained description:\\n- Red SHAP mass: concentrated in the very lowest frequency rows (near 0 Hz) from roughly time steps ~13 through ~104 (most intense between ~36 and ~95), with weaker low-frequency positive attribution toward the end (~130\u2013143) and some positive at the start (t\u22480). I use those red blocks to locate the discriminative time windows in the waveform.\\n- Early window (t \u2248 0\u201320): the raw trace begins very high (~+2.7 to +2.9 at t=0) then falls smoothly and steeply to a wide trough around t\u224818\u201324 (minimum \u2248 -1.2 to -1.5). Change rate: the early descent is relatively rapid (large negative slope over ~15\u201320 steps). Volatility inside the trough is low (broad, smooth bottom). STFT: low-frequency energy is present at the start and across this descent, consistent with SHAP.\\n- Mid windows (t \u2248 36\u201370 and t \u2248 70\u201390): the series shows a sequence of broad, smooth positive lobes/peaks (peaks near +0.6 to +0.8 at around t\u224855 and t\u224865\u201378). These rises are relatively smooth with low local jitter (low volatility within the lobes), and slopes are moderate on the upswings. STFT: strong energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins during these lobes; SHAP: strongest red overlap here. Substructure: the mid-section is multi-lobed (a smaller hump then a slightly larger hump) separated by troughs\u2014each lobe is wide (tens of steps) and dominated by slow variations.\\n- Later-mid window (t \u2248 78\u2013104): following mid peaks there is a descent into a trough (around t\u224895\u2013105, amplitude roughly -1.0 to -1.4). This descent includes a somewhat faster change than the broad rises and the STFT shows slightly more mid-frequency content here; however SHAP remains focused on the lowest frequency rows (positive attribution mainly for the low-frequency envelope).\\n- End window (t \u2248 120\u2013143): the signal climbs sharply toward another high endpoint (~+2.7\u2013+2.9 at t=143). SHAP shows some low-frequency positive contribution near the end, and STFT again indicates low-frequency energy \u2014 the final broad rise is treated as supportive by the model but is less intensely red than the main mid windows.\\n- Volatility & frequency: within the main red-attributed windows volatility is low (smooth ramps and broad lobes). Small high-frequency wiggles exist (visible in plots around the mid troughs) but STFT energy there is much lower and SHAP is neutral/weak for higher frequency rows: the model downweights high-frequency texture and emphasizes slow, large-scale shape.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / combined-feature characterization:\\n- Overall trend & envelope: Sample 51 has a strong low-frequency envelope composed of 2\u20133 broad undulations across 144 points: an early high\u2192deep trough, a mid-region of two successive low-frequency positive lobes, a later trough, then a large terminal rise. This matches a multi-lobe low-frequency pattern rather than isolated spikes.\\n- Periodicity & timing: roughly quasi-periodic low-frequency cycles with spacing of tens of time steps (~40\u201370 steps between some extrema). The timing and ordering (early high \u2192 trough \u2192 mid double-lobe \u2192 trough \u2192 final rise) are consistent and phase-linked; the classifier appears to use these ordered coarse features together.\\n- Volatility: low inside lobes, somewhat higher during faster descents/rises (notably early descent and late climb). High-frequency noise is minor and not driving classification (confirmed by STFT and neutral/hardly-blue SHAP at higher rows).\\n- Combination dependence: the model\u2019s positive evidence accumulates when multiple low-frequency bulges/troughs occur at the specific mid/late positions \u2014 i.e., the presence of the early endpoint bulge, the mid double-lobe, and the terminal rise together strengthen class support.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label summaries and selecting best match:\\n- Match vs label_6 (F-15): high correspondence. The label_6 summary emphasizes (a) very-low-frequency energy concentrated across the middle region (approx. t13\u2013104) with intense contributions around t65\u201391, (b) a large positive early offset, broad troughs and peaks, and (c) a final large low-frequency rise. Sample 51 exhibits all these: large starting value, early trough, twin mid low-frequency peaks, trough then strong final rise; SHAP low-frequency red blocks align strongly with the label_6 description. This is a near-complete match: similarity = 4/4.\\n- Match vs label_5 (F-22): moderate overlap (both emphasize mid low-frequency lobes), but label_5 descriptions usually show a single dominant mid-hump (centered ~36\u201370) and generally smaller mid-lobe amplitudes and different relative timing. Sample 51 has multiple broad lobes plus large endpoint bulges which better fit label_6. Similarity = 2\u20133 (closer to 2).\\n- Match vs labels 0,1,2,3,4 (Mirage, Eurofighter, F-14 closed/open, Harrier): these labels also reference low-frequency structures in their summaries but the timing, asymmetry, and multi-lobe pattern differ. For example, Harrier (label 4) typically shows one dominant mid large-amplitude peak (a single pronounced hump at ~52\u201371) while Sample 51 shows multiple repeated lobes and the specific early trough + mid double-lobe + terminal rise sequence characteristic of label_6. Therefore similarity to these other labels is low (1\u20132). Overall the highest match is label_6.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Reference-sample cross-check and final verification:\\n- The four provided similar reference samples (Samples 50, 91, 49, 35 \u2014 all labeled 6) are visually and spectrally almost identical to Sample 51: same initial high endpoint, early deep trough at ~20, twin mid-lobes near t\u224855\u201378, a later trough near ~95\u2013105, and a strong final climb. Their STFTs show the same concentration of energy at the lowest frequency rows during the same time windows, and their SHAP maps highlight the same low-frequency rows at the same times. This strong consistency with training examples labeled 6 confirms the model would (and should) assign label 6.\\n- The two dissimilar references (Samples 3 and 90, label 4) show a very different mid-centered single large positive hump (dominant around t\u224860\u201370) and different SHAP patterns; they lack the repeated multi-lobe mid structure and the combination of early high\u2192trough\u2192mid-double-lobe\u2192late rise seen in Sample 51. This further supports that Sample 51 does not belong to label 4.\\n- Potential caveats: Sample 51\u2019s SHAP shows very concentrated low-frequency positive attribution and only small mid-frequency negative patches \u2014 consistent with label_6 where the classifier strongly rewards low-frequency envelope. There is no contradictory strong negative SHAP in the mid-low frequencies that would suggest a different label.\\n\\nConclusion (final classification & chosen score):\\n- Final predicted label: label 6 (F-15). Rationale: near-exact match of temporal ordering, amplitude profile, low-frequency power distribution (STFT), and SHAP attribution to the reference label_6 pattern and to multiple label_6 training samples.\\n- Confidence / similarity score for chosen label: 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}",

Corresponding trace: a large, smooth downward ramp from the high start (~+2.8 at t=0) to a wide trough near t\u224820 (\u2248 -1.3 to -1.5). Characteristics: large amplitude (~-4.0 total from start to trough), low volatility inside the descent (monotonic, little high-frequency noise), steep averaged change rate over this interval (roughly -0.18 to -0.25 units/step across the descent). STFT: energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins. Interpretation: a broad low-frequency negative lobe (early trough) that the model treats as positive evidence.\\n\\n- SHAP/low-frequency block #2 (approx. t \u2248 48\u201366): strong red at very-low-frequency rows centered on mid-sequence. Trace: a smooth, broad positive hump rising from slightly negative/near-zero up to a local peak around +0.6..+0.8 (peak near t\u224855\u201366). Characteristics: low local volatility, gradual rise (average slope ~+0.05\u2013+0.12 units/step), single broad lobe (no sharp multi-peaked jitter). STFT: concentrated low-frequency energy in the same window. Interpretation: a mid-sequence low-frequency bulge that the classifier uses positively.\\n\\n- SHAP/low-frequency block #3 (approx. t \u2248 72\u201392): strong red again in the lowest-frequency band. Trace: another smooth positive lobe (twin/serial broad peaks around t\u224872\u201380 and t\u224882\u201390, amplitudes ~+0.6..+0.8) followed by a relatively rapid decline afterward to a deep trough. Characteristics: low volatility within each lobe but the descent after ~78\u201392 contains sharper change (STFT shows some mid-frequency energy), and SHAP shows the lowest-frequency rows positive while mid-frequency rows are neutral/negative. Interpretation: repeated low-frequency lobes reinforce classification, while sharper transitions are penalized at mid frequencies.\\n\\n- SHAP/low-frequency block #4 (approx. t \u2248 125\u2013143): weaker positive low-frequency SHAP near the end. Trace: a strong final rise from a late trough (~t\u2248115 value \u2248 -1.3) to the sequence end (~t=143 \u2248 +2.8). Characteristics: large amplitude terminal rise, low-frequency dominance. STFT: low-frequency energy reappears at the end. Interpretation: a terminal broad positive bulge that adds positive evidence.\\n\\n- Frequency/volatility notes (from STFT + SHAP): the positively attributed regions consistently align with the lowest STFT bins (< ~0.05 normalized frequency). Mid-frequency bins show occasional negative SHAP during relatively abrupt drops (e.g., the descent after the mid-lobes). High-frequency content is minimal and either neutral or slightly negative in attribution. Overall: the model emphasizes slow, broad contour features (low-frequency lobes) and penalizes sharper, faster transitions (mid-frequency energy).\\n\\nTask 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and feature combination:\\n- Global trend & envelope: Sample 51 shows a high positive starting offset, a pronounced early decline to a wide trough, multiple mid-sequence low-frequency positive lobes (two or three broad humps in the 48\u201392 window), a deep late-mid trough (~100\u2013120), and a final large low-frequency rise to a high positive endpoint. The series is dominated by low-frequency, quasi-periodic undulations (broad peaks/troughs spaced tens of steps apart).\\n- Periodicity & frequency: STFT confirms most energy is in the lowest frequency bins; the series behaves like a slow oscillatory envelope with ~20\u201340 step spacing between major extrema. Localized faster transitions (not many) are visible (e.g., the descent after mid peaks) and correspond to some mid-frequency energy and slightly negative SHAP in those bands.\\n- Volatility: low within broad lobes (smooth monotonic rises/falls) and higher at particular steep transitions (which are penalized by the model). The mid-sequence is comparatively low-volatility (smooth rises to peaks), while the declines tend to be steeper than the rises (asymmetric).\\n- Temporal dependence & combination: the classifier appears to combine multiple separated low-frequency events additively \u2014 the early trough + mid lobes + final endpoint rise together form the positive signature. The timing (early trough, mid lobes at ~50\u201390, late trough and final rise) and relative amplitudes are important; the model prefers smooth, large-scale shape segments repeated across the series rather than isolated spikes.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Mapping to label feature summaries and initial similarity scoring (1\u20134):\\nI compared the sample's observed features with the seven label summaries provided. Short justification and numeric similarity score for each label:\\n- label 0 (Mirage): Mirage description emphasizes a mid-window slow rise from trough to plateau and large final rise; some overlap exists (mirage also values low-frequency lobes). However Mirage examples emphasize a few broad low-frequency lobes with specific amplitude/time shapes (particularly strong central peaks and other timing differences). Sample 51 shares low-frequency dominance but differs in mid-lobe amplitudes and repeated twin peaks. Score: 2 (low similarity).\\n- label 1 (Eurofighter): Eurofighter focuses on a dominant asymmetric mid-cycle (rise to a large mid peak then steeper fall) and de-emphasizes terminal rises. Sample 51 has repeated mid lobes and a strong terminal rise, so partial similarity but not a close match. Score: 2 (low similarity).\\n- label 2 (F-14 wings closed): Label-2 descriptions highlight early fall into wide trough, multiple low-frequency humps, and a pronounced late trough followed by recovery. Sample 51 has an early trough, multiple mid humps, and a late trough with final recovery \u2014 that pattern is fairly similar though amplitudes and exact timing differ. Score: 3 (moderate similarity).\\n- label 3 (F-14 wings opened): Described as several separated low-frequency lobes (early downward deflection, deep trough mid, late positive pulses). Sample 51 has several separated lobes and troughs; there is moderate overlap but the sample's mid positive lobes and final large endpoint rise better match label 6. Score: 3 (moderate similarity).\\n- label 4 (Harrier): Harrier is characterized by a single dominant mid-segment very large positive bump (peak near +2.6) and strong asymmetry around that central hump. Sample 51 has mid bumps but their amplitudes are smaller (~+0.6..+0.8) and lacks the single dominant central +2.5 feature; instead it has several smaller low-frequency lobes and strong endpoints. Score: 2 (low similarity).\\n- label 5 (F-22): F-22 summary describes a primary mid hump (rise to ~+0.8 around mid-sequence), repeated smaller lobes, and supportive endpoint amplitude. This is similar to parts of sample 51 (mid humps \u2248 +0.6..+0.8 and endpoints positive), so there is moderate similarity. However sample 51 has stronger early trough and pronounced final rise which better align with label 6's description. Score: 3 (moderate similarity).\\n- label 6 (F-15): Label-6 summary explicitly matches many of sample 51's core traits: strong very-low-frequency energy across the middle, a large positive starting offset followed by a steady decline into a broad trough, repeated broad mid-sequence peaks near 65 and ~78 with low volatility, penalization of sharper mid-frequency transitions during steep drops, and a large final terminal bulge. The SHAP emphasis on the lowest-frequency rows in the middle region, the twin mid-lobes, the early trough and the final strong rise are all described in label_6. Score: 4 (high similarity).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples and final verification:\\n- The provided four \u201csimilar\u201d training examples are labelled 6 and their traces/STFT/SHAP maps are essentially near-clones of Sample 51 (same overall envelope: high start, early trough, twin mid-lobes around 55\u201380, late trough, strong final rise; STFT energy concentrated at lowest bins; SHAP positive in bottom rows across middle). That empirical correspondence reinforces assigning label 6.\\n- The two dissimilar reference samples are label 4 (Harrier) and show a single dominant central hump centered ~60\u201370 with amplitude much larger than sample 51 and different SHAP patterns (strong, localized central low-frequency energy and different mid-frequency attributions). Sample 51 does not match that distinctive single, large mid hump \u2014 supporting the rejection of label 4.\\n- Consistency check: the local feature descriptions (Task 1) align well with label_6's feature list (early large positive start and decline, sustained low-frequency mid structure, twin mid-peaks, mid-frequency penalties on fast descents, large final rise). The SHAP + STFT pattern in sample 51 mirrors the label_6 examples and their SHAP heatmaps (red concentrated at lowest frequencies across the same mid windows).\\n\\nFinal decision and justification:\\n- The most consistent label is label 6 (F-15). The sample matches the label_6 pattern at a high level: early high offset \u2192 wide early trough \u2192 several smooth low-frequency mid lobes (twin peaks near ~55\u201380) \u2192 late trough \u2192 strong terminal bulge; STFT and SHAP both show the same low-frequency emphasis that label_6 summary and reference examples report. The four similar reference samples are also labelled 6 and visually / spectrally match closely, confirming the classification.\\n\\nPer-label similarity summary (for transparency): label_0:2, label_1:2, label_2:3, label_3:3, label_4:2, label_5:3, label_6:4. Final predicted label: label 6 with confidence score 4.\"\n    ]\n}"

The strongest red block spans roughly time steps ~20\u2013100 (most intense ~26\u201391), with weaker but still positive low-frequency attribution at the sequence start and toward the end. The STFT confirms elevated magnitude at the bottom frequency bins in those same time windows (very-low-frequency / DC-like energy).\\n- Map those times onto the raw trace and describe local events precisely:\\n  \u2022 t \u2248 0\u201320 (early window tied to low-freq SHAP): the trace starts very high (~+2.7 to +2.9 at t=0) and falls steadily to a deep trough by ~t=18\u201326 (values \u2248 -1.2 to -1.6). This is a large-amplitude, smooth downward ramp (low volatility inside the ramp). Average slope in the fall is large negative (steep for this series) but the waveform remains low-frequency (STFT energy at the bottom row). SHAP gives positive attribution here, so the model treats an early large positive offset followed by a wide trough as supportive.\\n  \u2022 t \u2248 36\u201370 (mid window where SHAP remains positive): the series rises from negative trough into a broad positive lobe peaking around t\u224852\u201366 (peak amplitude \u2248 +0.7 to +0.95). The rise is relatively smooth with low local jitter; the lobe appears as a broad, low-frequency hump in both STFT and the time plot. SHAP intensity is high across the lowest-frequency rows during this hump, indicating the classifier heavily weighs this slow bulge.\\n  \u2022 t \u2248 70\u201392 (continuation of mid positive attribution): after the first mid hump there is another broad positive excursion (twin-peak style) and some moderate decline toward a trough near t\u224895 (values \u2248 -1.4). The twin-peak / multi-lobe mid-structure is low-frequency (STFT bottom rows) and SHAP remains positive for these low-frequency components. Volatility is slightly higher during transitions (some small wiggles), but these are minor and are not strongly positively attributed.\\n  \u2022 t \u2248 95\u2013125: a pronounced low trough is present near ~t=95\u2013105 (down to roughly -1.3 to -1.6) followed by recovery; mid-frequency energy increases a little during the faster descent/recovery but SHAP at mid frequencies is neutral-to-slightly-negative there.

Sharpness is limited to the descent/recovery transitions, which show modest mid-frequency content in the STFT and are not strongly positively attributed by SHAP. Small high-frequency wiggles (amplitude ~0.05\u20130.2) appear near transition points but have low STFT energy and neutral SHAP, so they are not primary drivers.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 Overall features, temporal dependence and combination of events:\\n- Global structure: The sample shows a pronounced low-frequency envelope across the whole sequence: large positive starting offset, an early smooth descent into a deep trough, then mid-sequence repeated broad positive lobes (twin/harmonic-like peaks), a deep mid-late trough, and a final strong terminal rise. This produces quasi-periodic, long-wavelength undulations (typical period on the order of ~40\u201370 time steps between major extrema). STFT confirms most energy sits in the lowest-frequency bins across these key windows.\\n- Volatility and frequency content: Low volatility within lobes (smooth ramps), slightly higher volatility during the steeper descents/ascents (where STFT shows some mid-frequency energy). SHAP shows the model rewards the slow low-frequency components (positive SHAP concentrated at bottom rows) and tends to penalize or be neutral to mid/high-frequency bursts.\\n- Temporal dependence: The classifier appears to use the ordering/phase of broad features: an early high \u2192 early deep trough \u2192 mid twin broad peaks \u2192 mid-late trough \u2192 final rise. The SHAP positive blocks line up with the broad lobes (not with short spikes), indicating that the model relies on the presence, amplitude, and sequence of these large-scale contour features rather than isolated local spikes.\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and initial selection:\\n- Compare to provided label summaries: The described pattern (strong early positive baseline, deep early trough, mid twin broad low-frequency peaks, mid-late trough and a strong final rise; classifier emphasis on very-low-frequency bands) closely matches the label 6 (F-15) description. Label 6 summary emphasizes broad low-frequency envelope across the middle, early positive offset, troughs and twin peaks near mid-sequence, and final large endpoint rise \u2014 the alignment is strong.\\n- Quick assessment against other labels:\\n  \u2022 label 6 (F-15): very high similarity \u2014 features described in the label-6 summary (persistent very-low-frequency energy across middle windows, early positive offset, troughs, twin peaks, and final rise) are present almost point-for-point in the sample. => similarity score 4 (high).\\n  \u2022 label 5 (F-22): moderate similarity in that F-22 also uses low-frequency mid lobes, but F-22 typically has a single dominant mid hump and slightly different timing/amplitude pattern; the sample shows multiple mid lobes and stronger early/terminal offsets consistent with F-15. => similarity score 3 (moderate).\\n  \u2022 label 0/1/2/3/4 (Mirage, Eurofighter, F-14 closed/open, Harrier): some share of low-frequency lobes appears across many classes, but their characteristic timing/asymmetry differs from this sample. For example, Harrier (label 4) expects a single dominant mid hump with a particular trough\u2192peak contrast; Mirage and Eurofighter mid-window patterns have different phase/asymmetry. Overall these labels mismatch timing/ordering of major lobes and so score lower. => similarity scores 1 or 2 (low to no).\"\n\n    ,\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided training reference samples (consistency check):\\n- The 4 similar reference samples provided are all labeled 6 and their plots/STFT/SHAP maps are visually and structurally nearly identical to the test sample: identical early high value, early trough near t\u224820\u201330, twin mid low-frequency peaks around t\u224852\u201380 with strong SHAP positive at the bottom frequency rows, a trough near t\u224895\u2013105, and final rise to a high endpoint. Their SHAP maps concentrate red in the lowest frequencies across similar time windows \u2014 the match is nearly one-to-one. This validates the initial selection of label 6 and supports a high similarity score.\\n- The two dissimilar examples (both label 4) show a dominant single central hump (t\u224852\u201370) that is much larger relative to other lobes and different ordering/contrast of early troughs and endpoints; their SHAP maps localize positive attribution specifically to that single central hump. Those patterns do not match the multi-lobe / twin-peak + early high + final high shape of the test sample. This increases confidence that the correct label is 6, not 4.\\n- Fairness & scoring logic: I used objective, repeated criteria \u2014 timing of the low-frequency red blocks, the number and timing of broad lobes in the time trace, STFT low-frequency concentration, and SHAP frequency-band localization \u2014 to decide similarity. The four reference label-6 examples reproduce the same features, so awarding '4' (high similarity) to label 6 is consistent and fair. Other labels receive lower implicit similarity because either their prototypical number/ordering of broad lobes or their asymmetry/timing differs.\\n\\nFinal conclusion: The test sample is classified as label 6 (F-15). I assign a high similarity score of 4 because the sample's detailed temporal/frequency/attribution features match the label-6 pattern and the provided label-6 reference samples very closely.\"\n  ]\n}",
      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 6\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 local (red SHAP) feature inspection and precise mapping to the trace: The SHAP heatmap shows concentrated positive attribution (deep red) in the very-low-frequency rows (closest to 0 Hz) spanning roughly time steps ~13 through ~104, with particularly strong red intensity in the middle of that range (roughly t\u224852\u201391). Using those red bands and the STFT as confirmation (strong energy at the lowest frequencies in the same windows), I mapped these time windows back to the time-series plot and describe them in detail: (a) Early window (t\u22480\u201320): the series starts very high (t=0 \u2248 +2.8 to +2.9) and falls smoothly to a deep trough around t\u224818\u201325 (\u2248 -1.2 to -1.4). The change is large (\u2248 -4.0 total from start to trough) and the descent is relatively smooth (low local jitter), so STFT shows low-frequency dominance. This early positive offset + broad downward sweep coincides with modest positive SHAP at low freq. (b) Middle windows (t\u224836\u201385 with strongest SHAP ~52\u201391): the trace exhibits multiple broad, smooth undulations (two main positive lobes/peaks and connecting troughs). Specifics: a mid-rise from near 0 to a first broad positive hump around t\u224852\u201360 (amplitude \u2248 +0.7 to +0.9), a slight dip, then another broad, somewhat higher hump around t\u224865\u201380 (amplitude \u2248 +0.6\u20130.9). Volatility inside these lobes is low (smooth ramps), and slopes are moderate (rise rates roughly +0.04\u2013+0.12 units/step depending on segment). The STFT shows concentrated energy in the lowest frequency bins for these intervals, matching the SHAP positive attribution \u2014 i.e., the classifier favors these slow, large-scale bulges. (c) Late-mid segment (t\u224878\u2013104): the signal has a descent from a peak into a trough that is somewhat steeper than the earlier rises; the STFT shows some mid-frequency energy here and the SHAP heatmap includes small blue (negative) cells at mid frequencies in this region \u2014 indicating the model penalizes sharper, higher-frequency transitions while still valuing the low-frequency envelope. (d) End segment (t\u2248130\u2013143): a final broad terminal rise to another high positive endpoint (~+2.8 at t=143) is visible; SHAP shows weaker but present low-frequency positive attribution there. Overall: the red (positive) SHAP areas correspond to broad, low-frequency lobes (early high baseline, mid multi-lobe positive bulges centered ~52\u201391, and a supportive final rise). The STFT confirms low-frequency energy is dominant where SHAP is red, and isolated mid-frequency bursts line up with neutral/negative SHAP.\",\n    \"Step 2 \u2014 overall series characterization and relationships between features: The series is dominated by a low-frequency quasi-periodic envelope made of 3\u20134 broad undulations across 144 points: an initial large positive offset and smooth decline (t0\u2192~20), a mid-section of alternating broad positive lobes and troughs (~36\u201391), a steeper mid-to-late descent (~78\u2013104) that introduces some mid-frequency content, and a broad terminal rise (~130\u2013143). Volatility is generally low inside the broad events (smooth ramps) and higher only during sharper descents (which appear in STFT as mid-frequency energy and are penalized per SHAP). Temporally, the classifier appears to combine evidence additively: multiple separated low-frequency lobes at particular relative positions (early bulge, mid paired humps, final rise) strengthen the class support. The negative SHAP at mid frequencies in the 78\u2013104 window shows the model disfavors sharp transitions superimposed on the low-frequency envelope, even when the envelope itself is supportive.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 match against label feature lists and selection: Comparing the observed pattern to the label summaries: (a) Label 6 (F-15) summary emphasizes exactly the same signature: strong positive SHAP concentrated at very-low-frequency bands across a broad middle region (roughly t\u224813\u2192104), an early large positive offset plus a broad trough around t\u224813\u201326, twin broad peaks in the mid (\u224852\u201378), and a final large endpoint rise \u2014 with the classifier penalizing sharper mid-frequency transitions. These correspond very closely to all major elements observed in the test sample. (b) Other labels: label 5 (F-22) and label 0/1/2/3/4 show some low-frequency-driven patterns but with different dominant temporal signatures (for example label 4 has one dominant central hump around ~52\u201371, label 2/3 emphasize different trough/peak timings and segmentation). The test sample shows multiple low-frequency lobes with the timing and SHAP-frequency profile most consistent with label 6. Therefore label 6 is the best match.\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 cross-check with reference samples and fairness of scoring: The provided similar reference samples (Samples 11, 19, 29, 91) are all labeled 6 and their plots/STFT/SHAP are visually and quantitatively consistent: each reference has a high starting positive offset, similar mid multiple low-frequency humps (peaks near the same time ranges), dominant STFT energy in the lowest frequency rows across those windows, and SHAP concentrated at the bottom rows. The minor mid-frequency negative SHAP around the steeper descent window is also present in the reference label-6 samples. Dissimilar references (label 4 examples 3 and 90) both show a single strong central hump (large, dominant peak ~t\u224860\u201370) and different SHAP/STFT signatures; they therefore differ from the test sample, reinforcing that label 4 is less likely. Based on this careful comparison I score the test sample as high similarity to label 6. I assign similarity 4 (high) to label 6. For transparency, relative qualitative similarity to other labels (summary): label 5 = 2 (low/moderate overlap in low-frequency emphasis but different timing/amplitude pattern), label 0/1/2/3/4 = 1\u20132 (largely different dominant temporal placements and single-hump vs. multi-lobe differences). The final single numeric score reported (4) corresponds to the chosen label 6 and reflects high match.\",\n    \"Final decision: The sample is classified as label 6 (F-15) with a high similarity score (4). The decision is supported by: concentrated positive SHAP in the lowest-frequency rows across t\u224813\u2013104; STFT confirming dominant low-frequency energy in those same windows; time-series shape consisting of an early positive start and trough, multiple smooth mid-section low-frequency lobes, and a final broad terminal rise \u2014 precisely the features emphasized in the label-6 description and present in label-6 reference examples.\"\n  ]\n}",

Change rate here is high on the descent (average slope ~ \u22120.15 to \u22120.22 units/step for the initial fall). Volatility in the descent is low (smooth ramp, no high-frequency spikes). The STFT shows elevated power at the lowest frequency rows and the SHAP map contains modest positive attribution at the earliest lowest-frequency row \u2014 indicating that this large early bulge and subsequent broad trough are considered supportive by the model.\",\n    \"3) Mid-sequence positive lobes (approx. t = 44 \u2192 80): There are one or two broad, low-frequency positive bulges: a moderate hump peaking around t \u2248 52\u201358 (amplitude ~+0.8) and a second hump / composite peak around t \u2248 64\u201378 (amplitude ~+0.6 to +0.95). These rises are relatively smooth (low volatility), the ascent into peaks is moderately paced (slopes roughly +0.05 \u2192 +0.12 units/step); declines after peaks are somewhat steeper in places. The STFT shows these events concentrate energy in the bottom frequency rows; SHAP shows strong red in those same low-frequency rows aligned with these bulges \u2014 so those broad convexities are the main positive evidence.\",\n    \"4) Mid-late trough & transition (approx. t = 80 \u2192 105): After the mid bulges the series moves down toward a pronounced trough near t \u2248 92\u2013100 (amplitude ~ \u22121.3 to \u22121.6).

Minor low-frequency positive contribution is also visible at the sequence ends but the main SHAP mass is the mid-block 13\u2192104.\\n- Corresponding waveform events (exact, unambiguous matches):\\n  * Early segment (t \u2248 0\u219222): large positive start (t=0 \u2248 +2.8\u2013+2.9) followed by a smooth, relatively steep decline to a broad trough around t\u224818\u201325 (amplitude near \u22121.1 to \u22121.4).

These mid events are low-volatility within each hump (few high-frequency spikes), with moderate, sustained slopes (typical rise slopes \u2248 +0.05 to +0.12 units/step). The STFT shows elevated energy at the lowest frequency bins during these same mid windows, confirming the events are slow/long-wavelength.\\n  * Late segment (t \u2248 130\u2192143): a pronounced final low-frequency rise from roughly +0.5 to the final endpoint \u2248 +2.8\u2013+2.9 (\u0394 \u2248 +2.3 over ~13 steps, avg slope \u2248 +0.17\u2013+0.18). SHAP shows modest positive low-frequency attribution at the end as well.\\n- Substructure & volatility: the important SHAP-positive intervals correspond to broad, smooth convex/concave shapes (large-scale curvature) with low within-event volatility. Shorter, higher-frequency wiggles exist (small amplitude around mid windows) but STFT magnitude there is small and the SHAP map is neutral to slightly negative in mid-frequency rows \u2014 indicating the classifier does not favor high-frequency texture for the final decision.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall sample characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Global trend & periodicity: the series is dominated by slow, quasi-periodic low-frequency oscillations (roughly two to three broad lobes across 144 points) plus large positive endpoints.

Higher-frequency content is weak overall (STFT concentrated near 0 Hz) and those higher-frequency bands are not positively attributed by SHAP.\\n- Combination & dependence: the classifier appears to treat multiple separated low-frequency lobes additively \u2014 positive evidence accumulates when broad, smooth bulges/troughs appear in the specific mid time window (\u224813\u2013104) plus the strong endpoint bulges.

So low similarity.\\n  * label 1 (Eurofighter): score 2 \u2014 Eurofighter emphasizes a dominant mid-window asymmetric cycle around ~39\u201395; our sample does have mid-window slow cycles, but the precise asymmetry and role of early/late rises differ; partial match but not the best.\\n  * label 2 (F-14 wings closed): score 2 \u2014 label-2 patterns include multiple troughs and peaks at specific windows; there is some resemblance (multi-lobe), but the timing/amplitude pattern is not as close as label 6.\\n  * label 3 (F-14 wings opened): score 2 \u2014 also low-frequency lobes and multiple slow swings, but test sample's sequence and endpoint behavior better align with label 6.\\n  * label 4 (Harrier): score 1 \u2014 Harrier reference shows a single dominant mid-segment big positive hump (trough\u2192large hump ~52\u201371) with different shape/asymmetry. The test sample has multiple mid lobes and a very strong early baseline and final rise; visually and in STFT/SHAP the Harrier prototypes are dissimilar.\\n  * label 5 (F-22): score 2 \u2014 F-22 shows mid-sequence low-frequency hump(s) and endpoint support, some shared traits exist, but F-22 prototypes typically emphasize a dominant single mid hump earlier (~36\u201370) and different amplitude relationships; sample better matches label 6.\\n  * label 6 (F-15): score 4 \u2014 high similarity. The sample matches the label-6 feature list: low-frequency dominance across t\u224813\u2192104, strong early positive offset then trough, multiple smooth mid peaks (peaks near ~50\u201380), and final pronounced endpoint rise. The four provided similar reference examples are nearly visually identical to the test sample in waveform, STFT distribution and SHAP localization, supporting a high-confidence match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and dissimilar examples:\\n- The four \u2018similar\u2019 reference samples (Samples 19, 73, 23, 13 \u2014 all labeled 6) show nearly identical structure: same early high start, deep early trough, mid slow twin-peaks around ~50\u201380, low-frequency STFT energy concentrated at bottom rows in the same mid time window, and SHAP positive concentrated at the lowest frequencies across ~13\u2192104. Their SHAP heatmaps are essentially the same shape and timing as the test sample\u2019s SHAP. This reinforces the classification as label 6.\\n- The two \u2018dissimilar\u2019 reference samples (Samples 3 and 85 labeled 4) have a different key signature: a single very large central hump (large amplitude concentrated in a narrower mid-window) and different STFT/SHAP patterns (positive SHAP concentrated in a different mid time segment and often larger single-peak energy). The test sample lacks that single dominant central hump and instead shows multiple broad lobes and pronounced early and final bulges, so it is not consistent with label 4.\\n- Logic & fairness check: scoring assigned above reflects (a) direct match of core discriminative features (low-frequency mid-window SHAP mass, early trough and final rise), (b) relative timing/amplitude/shape matches to label prototypes, and (c) corroboration from the retrieved reference examples. No single trivial cue (e.g., endpoint amplitude alone) was used \u2014 classification leverages the temporal sequence of broad low-frequency features that the SHAP map identifies as positively attributed.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 6 (F-15) with high similarity score 4.

I therefore inspect those time ranges in the time series and STFT.\\n\\n- Early window (t \u2248 0\u201326, SHAP starts low then rises): The raw trace begins high (~+2.8 at t=0) and drops smoothly to a deep trough around t\u224820\u201326 (min \u2248 -1.3 to -1.5). This is a large-amplitude, low-frequency downward ramp: net change \u2248 -4.0 from start to trough over ~20\u201326 steps, average slope about -0.15 to -0.22 units/step. Volatility inside the descent is low (smooth monotonic fall, no high-frequency spikes). STFT: strong energy concentrated at the bottom frequency bins here; SHAP: low-frequency rows show positive attribution across the early descent (model treats that large slow descent as relevant).\\n\\n- Mid sequence (t \u2248 30\u201380, SHAP strongest): Several separated low-frequency lobes occur:\\n  * t\u224830\u201340: a moderate rebound from the early trough to near-zero / small positive (~0 to +0.2). Rise is smooth, low volatility.\\n  * t\u224842\u201352: a second negative lobe/trough (~-1.2 to -1.4) \u2014 again wide and smooth.\\n  * t\u224854\u201366 and t\u224868\u201380: two rounded positive pulses/peaks (peaks \u2248 +0.6 to +0.85) separated by a modest dip. Both pulses are low-volatility, broad (width \u2248 8\u201316 steps). The ascent into the first of these mid-peaks is modest-to-steep (rise of ~1.5 units over ~10 steps ~0.12\u20130.15 units/step), the falls are similarly gradual. STFT: these windows show concentrated low-frequency energy; SHAP: very strong red in the lowest-frequency rows aligned with these pulses \u2014 the model finds these broad mid-sequence bulges especially supportive.\\n\\n- Later-mid window (t \u2248 80\u2013116): The series exhibits another slow negative swing around t\u224892\u2013100 (trough \u2248 -1.2 to -1.5), followed by a small recovery and an additional trough near t\u2248112\u2013116. These changes include some sections with slightly faster slopes (e.g., the drop ~78\u2013100 is a bit steeper), and STFT shows primarily low-frequency energy there; SHAP remains positive in the low-frequency rows through much of this interval.\\n\\n- End window (t \u2248 120\u2013143): From \u2248t=120 onward the signal performs a sustained, smooth rise from roughly -0.5 up to a high endpoint \u2248 +2.85 at t=143. This final rise is large in amplitude (\u2248+3.3 units), fairly steady (average slope \u2248 +0.16\u20130.25 units/step in the strongest section) and dominated by the lowest-frequency STFT bin. SHAP shows modest positive attribution at low frequency near the end. The final broad terminal bulge is therefore part of the positively attributed signature.\\n\\n- Frequency/volatility detail: Across the SHAP-positive windows the STFT confirms energy concentrated at the very lowest frequency bins (large-scale/long-wavelength components). Localized higher-frequency jitter is minimal inside the broad lobes; areas with somewhat faster transitions show slightly more mid-frequency energy in STFT but SHAP still emphasises the lowest bands.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall series characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Dominant behavior: The sample is dominated by a low-frequency, multi-lobed envelope (several broad peaks and troughs spaced across the 144 points). The envelope shows repeated slow undulations (early high \u2192 deep trough \u2192 mid twin-peaks \u2192 late troughs \u2192 strong final rise). Most of the discriminative energy (per STFT and SHAP) sits in the very-low-frequency band.\\n- Periodicity & spacing: Extrema occur roughly every ~20\u201330 time steps (early trough ~20; mid trough ~46; mid peaks ~55\u201378; later trough ~96\u2013115; final peak ~143), so there's a quasi-periodic low-frequency oscillation rather than high-frequency repetition.\\n- Volatility: Volatility is low during the broad lobes (smooth ramps) and increases modestly during the steeper transitions (e.g., early drop and the mid-to-late drops). Overall the series exhibits low local jitter and mostly coherent slow waves.\\n- Temporal combination/dependence: The classifier's SHAP map indicates additive positive attribution from multiple separated low-frequency lobes \u2014 the presence, amplitude and ordering of these slow bulges/troughs (especially the mid twin-peaks and the final endpoint bulge) together push the model toward the positive class. The ordering (early high then deep trough then mid twin peaks then late troughs then final rise) is consistent across the time axis and likely important to the model.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries and initial label selection (per-summary similarity scores):\\n- Compare to label 6 (F-15): The label-6 summary specifically notes strong positive SHAP at very-low-frequency bands across the middle region (~13\u2192104) with particularly intense contribution ~65\u219291, early high positive offset, broad troughs and twin mid peaks (near ~65 and ~78), a steep drop around ~78\u2192104 that produces mid-frequency energy (penalized), and a strong final terminal bulge. The test sample shows all these elements: early high start, repeated deep troughs, twin mid positive pulses (~54\u201380), SHAP concentrated at very-low frequencies in the mid region, and a large terminal rise. The four provided similar training examples are all label 6 and visually match the test sample closely. Therefore label 6 is a very strong match. Similarity score: 4 (high).\\n- Compare to label 5 (F-22): Label-5 emphasizes a primary mid hump (~36\u201370) plus supporting lobes and endpoints sometimes high. Test sample has multi-lobe mid structure (two mid peaks rather than a single dominant hump). There is some similarity (low-frequency mid energy and endpoint amplitude), but F-22 descriptions focus on a single mid hump and a different arrangement. Similarity score: 3 (moderate).\\n- Compare to label 0 (Mirage): Label-0 emphasizes concentrated low-frequency positive attribution at several windows (early, mid 26\u201365, later 64\u201392 and final rise). There is partial overlap (Mirage also uses low-frequency broad bulges and final rise). However the exact mid-structure and the twin-peak pattern differ. Similarity score: 2 (low-moderate).\\n- Compare to label 1 (Eurofighter): Label-1 focuses on a dominant asymmetric low-frequency mid-cycle (~39\u201395) with smaller early or late contributions downplayed. The test sample shares a mid low-frequency cycle but also has a strong early and terminal bulge which label-1 typically discounts \u2014 overall partial match but not as close as label 6. Similarity score: 2 (low).\\n- Compare to label 2 & 3 (F-14 closed/open): Both F-14 variants descriptions show repeated low-frequency events, but their characteristic windows and shapes differ (and F-14 wings-open tends to have different timing/number/shape of lobes). Test sample shares generic low-frequency multi-lobe structure but lacks specific F-14 signature detail in the summaries. Similarity score for both: 2 (low).\\n- Compare to label 4 (Harrier): Label-4 is dominated by a single strong mid-segment positive hump (t\u224852\u201371) as the main discriminative feature. The test sample does not have a single isolated dominant mid hump \u2014 instead it has twin mid peaks, early/late large bulges and a different trough/peak ordering. Similarity score: 1 (no strong match).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with provided reference samples and finalize:\\n- The four similar reference samples (samples 22, 19, 11, 23) are all labeled 6 and are visually and spectrally very close to the test sample: same early high start, repeated low-frequency troughs and twin-ish mid peaks, low-frequency-dominant STFT energy centered in the mid-time windows, and strongest SHAP in the lowest-frequency rows across the mid region. Those matches confirm the model learned a consistent pattern for label 6 that appears in the test sample.\\n- The two dissimilar references (labels 4.0) highlight a single dominant mid hump at ~52\u201371 with different SHAP emphasis; they differ visibly from the test sample and therefore support excluding label 4.\\n- Given the near one-to-one match between test-sample manifestations (timing of troughs/peaks, low-frequency STFT energy, SHAP attribution concentrated at lowest frequencies mid-window, early high and final strong endpoint bulge) and label-6 description and training examples, label 6 (F-15) is the most appropriate classification.\\n\\nFinal assignment and scoring justification:\\n- Final predicted label: label 6 (F-15).\\n- Confidence / similarity score for this chosen label: 4 (high). This is justified because: (a) multiple distinctive features in the test sample (early high baseline, multiple broad troughs, twin mid positive lobes, late troughs and final large terminal rise) appear explicitly in the label-6 feature description; (b) STFT and SHAP align closely with the label-6 pattern (strong low-frequency energy and red SHAP concentrated across mid time windows); (c) four retrieved training reference examples labeled 6 closely match the test sample in time-series morphology and in SHAP/STFT signatures.\\n\\nPer-label similarity summary (for transparency):\\n- label 0: 2\\n- label 1: 2\\n- label 2: 2\\n- label 3: 2\\n- label 4: 1\\n- label 5: 3\\n- label 6: 4\\n\\nConclusion: After careful, stepwise comparison of local features (time ranges, amplitudes, slopes, volatility), global envelope (low-frequency multi-lobed structure and final large rise), STFT support, SHAP attribution, and cross-checking against the provided reference samples, the test sample is best classified as label 6 (F-15) with high similarity (score 4).\"\n    ]\n}",

I therefore inspect those time intervals in the trace and STFT.\\n- Early segment (t \u2248 0 \u2192 20): the trace starts very high (~+2.8 to +2.9 at t=0) and falls smoothly to a deep trough near t\u224818\u201322 (\u2248 \u22121.2 to \u22121.4). Change rate \u2248 \u22120.18 to \u22120.22 units/step; volatility is low within the descent (no strong high\u2011frequency jitter). STFT shows the energy of this event is concentrated at the lowest frequency bins and SHAP gives positive attribution at those low frequencies \u2014 i.e., a broad early baseline bulge followed by a slow decline is an important low\u2011frequency feature.\\n- Mid segment (t \u2248 36 \u2192 80): there are two broad low\u2011frequency positive lobes/peaks. First rises from about t\u224836 from near \u22120.9 up to a local positive peak around t\u224854\u201358 (\u2248 +0.6 to +0.8), then falls to a trough around t\u224862\u201366 (\u2248 +0.1 to \u22120.2) and then rises again to another broad peak near t\u224874\u201380 (\u2248 +0.7\u20130.9). These lobes are smooth (low volatility inside lobes), asymmetric (rise can be steeper than fall in places), span ~10\u201320 steps each, and STFT shows these events are dominated by very-low-frequency energy. SHAP low-frequency rows are strongly red over these lobes, so the classifier treats these slow, broad bulges as positive evidence.\\n- Late-mid trough and recovery (t \u2248 86 \u2192 120): there is a decline after the mid peaks into more negative values near t\u224892\u2013100 (\u2248 \u22120.5 to \u22121.4) and another trough around t\u2248110\u2013118 (\u2248 \u22121.2 to \u22121.4). These downward transitions are relatively steeper than the rises (higher local slope) and STFT shows some mid-frequency content during the sharper drops; correspondingly SHAP at mid frequencies is mixed or slightly negative there (classifier penalizes sharper/higher\u2011frequency changes).\\n- Terminal rise (t \u2248 125 \u2192 143): the series climbs from roughly \u22120.4/0.0 at ~125 to a strong endpoint ~+2.9 at t=143. This final rise is broad and low\u2011frequency (STFT low\u2011freq energy returns), and SHAP again shows modest positive attribution at the lowest frequency rows near the end. Change rate in final rise \u2248 +0.12 to +0.20 units/step across the last ~20 steps.\\n- Frequency notes (STFT + SHAP): low-frequency bins (< ~0.05 normalized) carry the dominant energy aligned with the red SHAP blocks. Higher frequencies are weak overall except during sharper transitions (where STFT shows some mid-frequency energy and SHAP tends to be neutral-to-negative in those bands). This confirms the classifier relies on slow, large-scale contour components rather than fine high-frequency detail for positive evidence.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Global / combined features & temporal dependence:\\n- The entire trace is dominated by a low-frequency envelope: a high initial bulge, a deep early trough, two mid low\u2011frequency positive lobes (a multi\u2011lobe mid structure), a later trough/recovery, and a broad terminal rise to a large positive endpoint. This is quasi\u2011periodic at a long timescale (broad peaks/troughs spaced ~20\u201340 steps apart).\\n- Volatility: low inside the broad lobes (smooth ramps), higher around the relatively steeper downward transitions (mid\u2011frequency energy). The classifier penalizes these sharper changes (negative/mixed SHAP at mid frequencies) while rewarding the smooth lobes (strong positive SHAP at the lowest frequencies).\\n- Temporal dependence: the pattern of early high \u2192 deep trough \u2192 mid double lobes \u2192 late trough \u2192 final rise appears ordered and repeated; the classifier\u2019s SHAP attribution aligns with these specific time windows (i.e., it is sensitive to both timing/phase and amplitude of these low\u2011frequency events). The combination (multiple separated low\u2011frequency lobes plus the terminal bulge) accumulates positive evidence.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to label feature summaries (which label matches best?):\\n- Label 6 (F-15): The label\u20116 summary explicitly describes strong positive SHAP concentrated in very-low-frequency bands across an early bulge, a deep trough near t\u224813\u201326, low\u2011frequency twin peaks around the mid interval (\u2248 52\u201391) with some mid-frequency penalties for sharp drops, and a pronounced late final rise. This matches almost exactly the local and global features observed for sample 81 (early high \u2192 trough, mid twin broad peaks, late trough then strong final rise; low\u2011frequency STFT energy and SHAP at same locations). Therefore match = high (score 4).\\n- Label 5 (F-22): has mid low\u2011frequency hump(s) (~36\u201370) and positive edges but typically smaller endpoint structure; somewhat similar (mid hump exists here) but label\u20115 descriptions emphasize a single dominant mid hump of slightly smaller amplitude and less the strong early + final bulges. Match = moderate (score 3).\\n- Label 0 (Mirage): emphasizes large low\u2011frequency components and multiple broad peaks/troughs including strong mid and final rises; there is some overlap with our sample (multi-lobe low\u2011frequency structure and final rise), but Mirage places stronger weight on particular mid windows (26\u201365) and smoother single-sweep rises in some examples. Match = moderate (score 3).\\n- Label 2 (F-14 wings closed): describes early steep decline into a trough and repeated trough/hump structure across the sequence; there are similarities (early trough + late trough + recovery) but the precise timing and twin mid peaks of our sample align less strongly with the prototypical label\u20112 windows. Match = low (score 2).\\n- Label 3 (F-14 wings opened): similar multi-lobe low-frequency structure but the characteristic timing/amplitude pattern (very deep mid troughs and different arrangements) is not as consistent with sample 81. Match = low (score 2).\\n- Label 1 (Eurofighter): focuses on an asymmetric large mid-cycle (39\u219295) with a specific smaller hump then larger hump then sharp fall; our sample has twin mid lobes but the full pattern and the strong early/final bulges match label\u20116 more closely. Match = low-to-moderate (score 2).\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross check with provided reference samples and re-evaluate fairness:\\n- The four \\\"similar\\\" reference samples (Samples 22, 19, 11, 23) are all labeled 6 and their plots, STFTs and SHAP heatmaps are visually nearly identical to sample 81: same very-high starting value, early decline to trough, mid twin low\u2011frequency lobes around t\u224850\u201380, low-frequency STFT energy concentrated in the same time windows, and strong low\u2011frequency SHAP red patches in the same regions. This strongly reinforces that sample 81 belongs to label 6.\\n- The two dissimilar references (Samples 90 and 3, label 4) show a very different structure: a dominant extremely large mid peak (~t\u224860\u201370 with amplitude > +2), which sample 81 does not exhibit. Their SHAP also concentrates at that mid peak differently. This confirms sample 81 is not label 4.\\n- The scoring logic above is consistent with the per-label feature summaries and with the reference examples: label\u20116 reference examples match both shape and SHAP/STFT patterns closely. The moderate scores for label 0 and 5 reflect genuine partial overlaps (multi-lobe low\u2011freq structure) but the precise timing, presence of early high bulge and final strong rise plus the twin mid\u2011lobes align best to label 6.\\n\\nFinal decision: label 6 (F-15). Justification summary: sample 81 exhibits the canonical low\u2011frequency, multi\u2011lobe contour described for label 6 \u2014 early high baseline then deep trough; twin mid broad positive lobes with low volatility; penalized sharper mid-frequency drops; and a broad final rise. STFT and SHAP both point to very\u2011low\u2011frequency relevance in the same windows, and the four provided nearest training examples (all label 6) match this pattern closely. Hence final classification = label 6 with high similarity (4/4).\"\n  ]\n}",

This maps to broad, slow waveform events in the raw trace: an early large drop, a sequence of smooth mid-sequence lobes, and a mid/late large swing. STFT confirms these events are dominated by very low frequency energy (bottom STFT rows are brightest over the same windows), so the classifier is using slow, large-scale contour components in those intervals.\",\n    \"2) Early segment (t \u2248 0\u201326): The trace starts very high (~+2.7 to +2.9 at t=0) then descends smoothly to a deep trough (\u2248 -1.2 to -1.5) by roughly t\u224820\u201326. Change rate: the large descent is relatively steep compared with later ramps (roughly -0.15 to -0.22 units/step averaged over the initial descent). Volatility: low inside the monotonic descent (no rapid oscillations); STFT shows low-frequency power.

Each of these lobes is low-volatility (gentle slopes within each lobe) and separated by tens of steps (i.e., low temporal frequency).

This final ascent is relatively fast compared with earlier broad ramps (average slope ~+0.14\u2013+0.18 units/step).

The timing of these broad events is consistent and the classifier\u2019s SHAP map emphasizes specific mid-sequence windows, indicating the model uses the ordering (phase) and relative amplitudes of these slow lobes.\",\n    \"2.3 Combination & dependence: Multiple separated low-frequency lobes (early bulge\u2192trough, mid twin broad humps and troughs, late trough\u2192strong final rise) combine additively in SHAP (multiple red low-frequency blocks).

Corresponding raw-series manifestations: a sequence of broad, smooth lobes (low volatility inside each lobe) rather than sharp spikes. Typical amplitudes in these windows: rises/peaks \u2248 +0.6 to +0.9 (mid peaks) and troughs \u2248 \u22120.9 to \u22121.4. Change rates inside these lobes are moderate and smooth (typical slopes \u2248 \u00b10.04\u20130.20 units/step depending on ascent/descent segment). STFT confirms concentrated energy at the lowest frequency bins during the same time ranges (bright at f\u22480 rows) \u2014 i.e., these are slow, large-scale contour features. Shape/substructure: well-formed broad convex humps separated by wide troughs; within each hump volatility is low and there is an asymmetric rise/fall in some lobes (rise slightly faster or slower than fall in places).\",\n    \"2) Early large downward swing (positive SHAP at lowest frequency around the start): time steps ~0\u201325 show a steep fall from ~+2.8 at t=0 down to a deep trough near \u22121.3 by t\u224822\u201326. Manifestation: high-amplitude, low-frequency descent with comparatively large instantaneous slope (~\u22120.15 to \u22120.22 units/step). STFT: low-frequency energy aligns with the descent.

Volatility is low during the monotonic descent (smooth transition).\",\n    \"3) Final terminal rise (low-frequency positive SHAP near the end): time steps ~125\u2013143 display a strong, sustained rise from slightly negative/near-zero up to ~+2.7\u2013+2.8 at the end. Manifestation: fairly large amplitude change with a sustained positive slope (~+0.12\u2013+0.20 units/step). STFT again indicates low-frequency energy and SHAP shows modest-to-strong red at the lowest-frequency rows near the end. This large endpoint bulge is treated as additional positive evidence.\",\n    \"4) Small mid/high-frequency detractors: SHAP shows occasional neutral-to-slight-blue at mid-frequency rows in windows near ~70\u2013100 (small blue patch in mid-frequency rows). The STFT there shows a modest amount of mid-frequency energy aligned with the steeper drops (e.g., around the descent ~78\u2013100).

In the raw time series this corresponds to: an early-to-mid smooth downward then upward envelope (start high at t=0 \u2248 +2.8, drop to a wide trough near t\u224818 at \u2248 -1.3 to -1.5), a recovery and two broad mid peaks (first mid-rise/peak around t\u224852\u201366 amplitude \u2248 +0.6\u2013+0.9, a nearby second broad hump around t\u224878\u201386 amplitude \u2248 +0.8), then a decline toward a trough near t\u2248100 (\u2248 -1.2). Manifestations: amplitudes are large in absolute value (endpoints and troughs \u2248 \u00b12.8 to \u00b11.3), volatility inside these broad events is low (smooth ramps with few sharp jumps), and change rates are moderate for ramps (typical slopes in the mid windows \u2248 +0.05\u2013+0.15 units/step for rises and up to -0.12 to -0.23 units/step for faster declines). STFT confirms that the energy driving these red regions is concentrated in the very lowest frequency bins (bottom rows bright), indicating these are broad, slow contour features (low-frequency / DC-like components) rather than short spikes.\\n- Secondary positively-attributed areas: modest low-frequency positive SHAP near the sequence start (t\u22480\u20138) and a small low-frequency positive block near the final time steps (t\u2248130\u2013143). On the time plot these align with the large positive start (~+2.8 at t=0) and the strong terminal rise (final value \u2248 +2.8 at t=143). These endpoints are broad (low volatility across a few points) and have STFT low-frequency energy, so the model treats them as supportive global bulges.\\n- Negative/neutral attributions in mid frequencies: small blue/neutral patches appear in mid-frequency rows around t\u224878\u2013104. In the time series those times include the steeper fall from the mid hump to the trough near t\u2248100 and some quicker local wiggles; STFT shows somewhat elevated mid-frequency content here and SHAP negative values indicate the classifier slightly penalizes sharper, higher-frequency transitions (the model prefers smoother low-frequency changes).\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and temporal dependence:\\n- Trend & envelope: The series displays a large-scale, low-frequency envelope across nearly the whole sequence: a high positive beginning, a broad early trough, repeated broad mid-sequence humps/troughs, and a strong terminal rise. The global shape is dominated by slow undulations (period on the order of tens of time steps). Endpoints are both large and positive (t=0 and t=143 \u2248 +2.8), framing the low-frequency cycles.\\n- Periodicity & frequency content: STFT shows most energy concentrated at the lowest frequency bins, especially during the red-attributed windows. This indicates the discriminative content is long-wavelength (broad contour) rather than fast oscillatory content. There are quasi-periodic broad cycles roughly every ~20\u201340 steps (trough near ~18, peaks near ~55 and ~80, trough near ~100, final rise by ~130\u2013143).\\n- Volatility & substructure: Within the broad lobes volatility is low (smooth monotonic ramps). Shorter, higher-frequency wiggles occur but have low power and are either neutral or slightly negative in SHAP (they slightly reduce confidence when present). The classifier appears to combine several separated low-frequency lobes additively: early bulge + mid twin-hump structure + late trough + terminal rise form the positive pattern.\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching the sample to label summaries (quick comparison to feature sets):\\n- Label 6 (F-15) summary key points: strong positive SHAP at very-low-frequency across mid region (t\u224813\u2192104) with early positive baseline and final large endpoint rise; penalizes mid-frequency sharp transitions. The test sample matches these almost exactly: low-frequency energy concentrated mid-sequence, early large positive value (t=0), mid broad peaks near 65\u201380, a trough near 100, and final strong rise to t=143. SHAP pattern also aligns (red concentrated in the bottom rows across mid times and small negative at mid frequencies where there are sharper transitions). => High similarity (score 4). Final predicted label: label 6.\\n- Label 5 (F-22) summary: also uses low-frequency mid humps (primary hump around t\u224836\u201370, smaller repeated lobes, supportive endpoints). Our sample shares the mid humps and endpoints but F-22 descriptions emphasize a single strong mid hump of moderate amplitude and slightly different timing/shape. Similarity is good but slightly lower than label 6 because label 6 explicitly describes the broad low-frequency envelope across many contiguous windows and penalization of mid-frequency transients seen here. => Moderate similarity (score 3).\\n- Label 0 (Mirage), Label 1 (Eurofighter), Label 2 (F-14 closed), Label 3 (F-14 opened), Label 4 (Harrier): these labels also describe important low-frequency lobes, but their characteristic temporal signatures differ in timing, amplitude asymmetry, or presence of very large central hump(s) that do not match this sample as closely. In particular:\\n  - Mirage (label 0) places strongest positive weight on a mid window ~26\u201365 and multiple specific lobes including a final strong rise, but the exact internal shapes, timing and the model penalization patterns differ enough to reduce confidence here. => score 3? (but to reflect less match than 6 I assign 4->1 mapping below).\\n  - Eurofighter (label 1) emphasizes a dominant asymmetric mid-cycle (rise 39\u201375 then steep fall 75\u201388) and downweights endpoint rises; sample has endpoint rises strongly positive and broader multi-lobe structure rather than the Eurofighter's specific asymmetric mid-cycle being the sole decisive element. => Low-moderate match (score 2).\\n  - F-14 variants (labels 2 & 3) emphasize distinct deep troughs and separated humps at particular windows; while the test sample has troughs and humps, the overall combination and the consistent low-frequency envelope correspond more closely to label 6. => Low similarity (score 2 for each).\\n  - Harrier (label 4) is characterized by one dominant, very large mid hump (t\u224852\u201371) reaching \u2248+2.6 and strong nearby troughs. Our sample has mid humps but their amplitudes are smaller (\u2248+0.6\u20130.9) and the overall multi-lobe low-frequency envelope + endpoint symmetry better matches label 6. => Low similarity (score 1).\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check against provided reference examples:\\n- The four provided 'similar' reference examples are all labeled 6 and their time plots, STFTs, and SHAP maps match the test sample closely: same large positive endpoints, smooth deep early trough (~t\u224818), twin-ish mid humps (around t\u224855\u201385) and concentrated red SHAP at the lowest frequency rows across the mid region. The small negative mid-frequency SHAP patches (penalizing sharper declines) are also present in some label-6 references. This strong match across multiple reference samples reinforces selecting label 6 with high confidence.\\n- The two 'dissimilar' references (both label 4) show a single very large mid peak (\u2248+2.5\u20132.7 at t~65) and different SHAP patterns (very concentrated central low-frequency energy and different surrounding troughs). The test sample lacks that single dominant large mid peak and instead has several moderate mid lobes plus large endpoints \u2014 supporting that label 4 is not a close match.\\nFinal decision & scoring: After careful element-by-element matching (time ranges, amplitude magnitudes, low-frequency dominance in STFT, SHAP location concentrated at bottom frequency rows, presence of large positive endpoints, and the model's penalization of localized mid-frequency sharpness), the best matching label is label 6 (F-15). The similarity scores for labels 0..6 are assigned [4,2,2,2,1,3,4] respectively to reflect the relative degree of match (4 = high, 3 = moderate, 2 = low, 1 = minimal).\"\n  ]\n}",
      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 6\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local feature (map red areas \u2192 time series details):\\n- SHAP red is concentrated in the lowest-frequency rows (near 0 Hz) across several contiguous mid/late windows (roughly t\u224813\u201326, t\u224852\u201391 and again low-frequency support toward the end t\u2248130\u2013143). I use those time ranges to inspect the raw trace and STFT.\\n- Early window (t\u22480\u201326, strongest around 13\u201326): the series begins very high (~+2.8 at t=0) and declines smoothly to a deep trough near t\u224820\u201326 (amplitude \u2248 -1.3 to -1.5). This is a large, low-frequency downward ramp: net change \u2248 -4.0 over \u224820\u201326 steps (average slope about -0.15 to -0.22 units/step). Volatility inside the descent is low (smooth monotonic drop, no strong high-frequency wiggles). STFT shows concentrated energy at the bottom frequency bin for this region, matching the SHAP attribution. Implication: a broad, slow negative lobe centered early is important here.\\n- Mid-window positive lobes (t\u224852\u201391, strongest SHAP around 52\u201391, with peaks ~65 and ~80): the trace climbs from negative values into a moderate positive hump near t\u224852\u201366 (peak \u2248 +0.5\u2026+0.9), drops slightly, then rises into another broad positive lobe around t\u224878\u201385 (peak \u2248 +0.7\u2026+0.9). Each hump is low-volatility (smooth curvature), lasts ~10\u201320 steps, and carries most STFT energy at the lowest frequency band \u2014 consistent with SHAP red concentrated at low frequencies. Change rates during the rises are moderate (roughly +0.05\u2013+0.12 units/step), slower than the very steep transitions but clearly low-frequency bulges.\\n- Mid-late sharp transition (t\u224878\u2013104): the STFT shows modest mid-frequency energy here and the SHAP map has small neutral-to-blue patches at mid frequencies in that interval. In the raw trace there is a relatively rapid descent from a peak down to a trough near t\u2248100\u2013110 (amplitude drop \u2248 -1.8 over ~20\u201330 steps but with some portions steeper). This faster change produces mid-frequency content that the SHAP heatmap slightly penalizes (blue at mid frequencies) even while the lowest-frequency rows around the same time still show some positive attribution. This indicates the model favors the broad slow lobes and disfavors sharper, higher-frequency edges in this region.\\n- Late window (t\u2248125\u2013143): a sustained large upward recovery and final rise from negative/modest values up to \u2248+2.8 at t=143 (average slope \u2248 +0.1\u2013+0.16 units/step). STFT again shows low-frequency energy and SHAP gives modest positive attribution at the bottom rows here. This terminal broad rise is a supportive low-frequency feature.\\n- Summary of local manifestations tied to SHAP: red-low-frequency SHAP blocks correspond to broad, smooth, large-amplitude lobes (early large downward lobe, mid double-hump, late broad ascent). Blue/neutral mid-frequency SHAP around t\u224878\u2013104 correspond to faster transitions and sharper edges which reduce support for the class. The STFT confirms that the important events are dominated by very-low-frequency energy (bottom rows) and that higher-frequency energy is modest and often penalized by the model.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and dependence:\\n- Dominant behavior: the sample is low-frequency dominated, quasi-periodic with several broad undulations across 144 points. The major large-scale events are: initial high level \u2192 smooth early fall to deep trough (t\u22480\u219225), mid double-bulge (t\u224852\u219291 with two broad peaks), a mid-late deeper trough (t\u2248100\u2192110) and a final broad rise (t\u2248125\u2192143). These occur in consistent, separated windows rather than as rapid oscillations.\\n- Frequency & volatility: STFT and SHAP both show most signal magnitude and positive attribution at the lowest frequency bins \u2014 consistent with the model relying on coarse contour/shape features. Volatility is low during these broad lobes (smooth ramps); intermittent increases in mid-frequency energy correspond to sharper transitions (penalized by SHAP at mid frequencies).\\n- Temporal dependence and combination: the classifier appears to combine temporally separated low-frequency lobes additively \u2014 multiple broad lobes occurring in the specific sequence (early trough, mid double hump, late trough + final rise) strengthen the prediction. The ordering matters (peaks and troughs at characteristic time ranges act as anchors) and abrupt mid-late changes reduce confidence when present.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Matching sample features to label summaries (brief check across labels):\\n- Label 6 (F-15): The label_6 description explicitly lists (a) a large early positive offset then decline to a trough near t\u224813\u201326, (b) twin broad mid peaks near t\u224865 and \u224878, (c) steep mid-late downward transition around \u224878\u2013104 which produces mid-frequency energy and is penalized, and (d) a final large low-frequency terminal rise. The sample matches these points closely in timing, amplitude, shape, volatility and STFT/SHAP patterns \u2192 high similarity.\\n- Label 5 (F-22): also shows mid broad hump (~36\u201370) and endpoint high values, but F-22 mid-hump amplitudes and the sequence of twin mid peaks differ (F-22 features are usually a dominant single broad hump near t\u224836\u201370 and smaller later lobes). Our sample has the exact trough/peak ordering and the penalized mid-late sharp descent that label_6 explicitly mentions; thus similarity is moderate but not as close as label_6.\\n- Label 0/1/2/3/4 (Mirage, Eurofighter, F-14 closed/open, Harrier): many of these labels emphasize low-frequency lobes at various time positions, but their specific timing, amplitude asymmetries and the combination of early high offset + trough at t\u224820\u201326 + twin mid peaks + penalized mid-late sharp drop + final large rise best match label_6. For example, Mirage (label_0) emphasizes particular mid segments and final rises but its mid-window timing and shapes differ from the twin mid-peak arrangement and penalty pattern we observe. Harrier (label_4) centers a single very large mid bump ~52\u201371 which is not the same twin-peak pattern seen here. F-14 variants emphasize different trough/peak placements and widths.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with the provided reference samples (training examples):\\n- Four similar reference samples (samples 50, 97, 56, 91 shown) are all labeled 6.0 and their plots, STFTs and SHAP heatmaps are visually and quantitatively close to the test sample: same early high start \u2192 smooth early decline to trough near t\u224820\u201325; twin mid low-frequency peaks near t\u224860\u201385; STFT low-frequency energy concentrated in the same windows; SHAP red concentrated at the bottom frequency rows across mid windows; and blue/neutral mid-frequency penalization during steeper mid-late transitions. The sample under test aligns very closely with all four references (amplitude ranges, time positions of extrema and STFT/SHAP patterns). This strongly validates label_6 assignment.\\n- Two dissimilar reference samples (label 4.0 examples shown) display a single very large central hump (large positive around t\u224864) with different STFT/SHAP signature (more concentrated energy in a single mid window and different SHAP distribution). These differ visually and in frequency/timing from the test sample, confirming those labels are less plausible.\\n\\nFinal decision and numeric justification:\\n- The test sample shows the set of distinctive features that the label_6 summary highlights: early high baseline then broad trough (t\u224813\u201326), twin smooth mid low-frequency peaks (\u224852\u201391), a mid-late sharper descent that produces mid-frequency energy and is penalized in SHAP, and a large final low-frequency rise. The provided label_6 reference plots are nearly the same as the test sample in shape, timing and attribution maps. Therefore the correct classification is label 6 (F-15) with high similarity.\\n- Score rationale: I assign a similarity score of 4 (high similarity) for label 6 because one of the label_6 feature descriptions directly enumerates this exact combination of events (timing, amplitude and penalized mid-frequency transitions), and the four provided label_6 reference samples visually and spectrally match the test sample very closely.\\n\\nConclusion: result = label 6, score = 4 (high similarity).\"\n  ]\n}"

      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 6\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Step 1 \u2014 Local (red-SHAP) feature description (fine-grained):\\n- Location of strong positive attribution: The SHAP heatmap shows concentrated positive (red) attribution in the lowest-frequency rows (closest to 0 Hz) mainly spanning roughly time steps 13 \u2192 104, with the strongest block around ~52 \u2192 91. I therefore inspect those time ranges on the time-series and STFT panels.\\n- Early block (approx. t = 0 \u2192 26; low-frequency red beginning near t\u224813): In the time series the sample starts very high (~+2.8 to +2.9 at t=0) and falls steadily through t\u224812 to near 0 and continues down to a broad trough around t\u224820 (amplitude \u2248 -1.2 to -1.4). This descent is smooth (low local volatility), fairly fast compared with later ramps: roughly \u22120.18 to \u22120.22 units/time-step over ~15\u201320 steps (strong low-frequency energy there as STFT confirms). SHAP gives positive attribution at the lowest frequency here, so the classifier treats this large early baseline drop + trough as supportive.\\n- Mid-section (approx. t = 36 \u2192 95; strongest SHAP \u2248 t\u224852\u219291): The trace contains multiple broad low-frequency lobes: a smooth rise from trough to a local hump near t\u224848\u201356 (peak \u2248 +0.6\u20130.8), then a small dip and another broad hump centered around t\u224865\u201380 (peaks near +0.7\u20130.9). These mid lobes are low-volatility (smooth ramps) with moderate slopes (ascent rates \u2248 +0.10 to +0.18 units/step in the rising flanks). STFT shows most energy concentrated in the lowest frequency bins during these periods, matching the SHAP red bottom rows. The local shape is a sequence of broad convex bulges (not sharp spikes) separated by smooth troughs \u2014 the classifier emphasizes their presence and exact timing.\\n- Late-mid trough & recovery (approx. t = 88 \u2192 110): Following the mid lobes there is a relatively quick descent into a late trough (around t\u224896\u2192105 amplitude \u2248 -1.2 to -1.6). That transition is somewhat steeper, producing a bit more mid-frequency energy in the STFT, and SHAP still prefers the low-frequency components (bottom rows red) while mid-frequency rows are neutral or slightly negative in places (classifier down-weights sharper components).\\n- Final segment (approx. t = 125 \u2192 143): The series then performs a pronounced smooth upward recovery and final rise, ending at a very large positive endpoint (~+2.8\u2013+2.9 at t=143). This last rise is fairly rapid but still dominated by low-frequency energy in the STFT; SHAP bottom rows show modest positive attribution near the end. The average slope in the terminal rise is around +0.14\u2013+0.18 units/step (rough estimate over ~18 steps).\\n- Volatility & substructure summary in red-attributed windows: Volatility is low inside broad lobes (smooth, few small wiggles), and higher-frequency micro-oscillations are low-energy in STFT and carry neutral/negative SHAP. That indicates the model is using coarse, long-wavelength contour features (broad peaks/troughs and their timing) rather than fine high-frequency texture to support the label.\\n\\nStep 2 \u2014 Overall time-series characterization and dependence:\\n- Global trend & envelope: The sample is quasi-periodic with dominant very-low-frequency content: an early very large positive offset, a deep early trough, two/three broad mid-sequence lobes, a late trough, and then a strong terminal rise. The STFT confirms energy concentrated at the bottom frequency bins during the key intervals; most discriminative SHAP is also concentrated in those bottom rows.\\n- Periodicity and spacing: The main extrema appear with roughly 15\u201330 step spacing (early trough ~20, mid peaks ~50\u201380, late trough ~100, final peak ~143), i.e., a slowly varying multi-lobe envelope rather than rapid cycles.\\n- Volatility: Low within lobes (smooth ramps), higher during transitions (mid-frequency content increases slightly during steeper descents/ascents). Small high-frequency wiggles are minimal and have little positive attribution.\\n- Combination & temporal ordering: The classifier appears to require the combination and order of these broad lobes (early high \u2192 early trough \u2192 mid twin humps \u2192 late trough \u2192 final large rise). The SHAP map shows additive positive contributions from multiple low-frequency windows (particularly mid-section and ends), meaning the model treats these low-frequency events as complementary evidence rather than isolated cues.\\n\\nStep 3 \u2014 Match to provided label feature patterns (selection & scoring rationale):\\n- Immediate qualitative match: The sample\u2019s feature set (very-high starting value, early descent to trough near t\u224820, mid twin low-frequency humps around t\u224850\u201380, a late trough and a strong final rise) matches the description given for label 6 (F-15) very closely. The label-6 summary explicitly notes strong positive SHAP concentrated at the very-low-frequency band spanning roughly t\u224813\u2192104 with particularly intense contribution around 65\u219291, an early large positive offset and decline, mid peaks near 65 and 78, a steep downward transition producing mid-frequency energy (penalized), and a pronounced final rise near the end \u2014 all are present in the test sample.\\n- Comparative scoring across all labels (1\u20134 scale; 4 = high similarity):\\n  - label_0 (Mirage): score 3 (moderate). Rationale: Mirage also emphasizes low-frequency large lobes and has mid-to-late broad peaks/troughs. However Mirage\u2019s most strongly attributed mid window is centered somewhat earlier (t\u224826\u201365) and the concrete pattern of early/late end peaks differs; sample matches some but not all Mirage specifics.\\n  - label_1 (Eurofighter): score 3 (moderate). Rationale: Eurofighter descriptions emphasize a dominant mid-window low-frequency asymmetric humps around t\u224839\u201395 which the sample also shows; but Eurofighter tends to rely more specifically on an ordered small hump followed by a larger hump and less on the prominent early high baseline/terminal rise pattern that here strongly supports label 6.\\n  - label_2 (F-14 wings closed): score 3 (moderate). Rationale: Label 2 shows multiple low-frequency troughs/peaks across early/mid/late windows like this sample. The timings of troughs are similar in places, but label_2\u2019s signature includes larger amplitude late troughs in slightly different positions and a different combination of hump magnitudes; so similarity is present but not as strong as label 6.\\n  - label_3 (F-14 wings opened): score 3 (moderate). Rationale: Label 3 emphasizes large low-frequency negative swings early (t\u224810\u201326), a deep trough around t\u224848\u201354, and a strong positive pulse around t\u224892\u2013106 \u2014 these components are visible in the test sample\u2019s sequence as well, giving moderate similarity. But the test sample\u2019s mid humps are broader and the endpoint pattern more strongly matches label 6.\\n  - label_4 (Harrier): score 2 (low). Rationale: Harrier is characterized by a single very large mid hump (peak ~+2.6 at t\u224852\u201371) that dominates the signature; the test sample\u2019s mid humps are much smaller (\u2248+0.7\u20130.9) while the test sample\u2019s terminal large endpoint rise is a more distinctive feature for label 6. Thus lower similarity.\\n  - label_5 (F-22): score 3 (moderate). Rationale: F-22 has a primary mid hump (~t\u224836\u201370) with similar low-frequency structure and repeated lobes; the test sample\u2019s mid-lobe shapes and low-frequency emphasis are consistent, but F-22\u2019s mid hump is often the dominant single feature and the training descriptions emphasize slightly different timing/amplitude relationships compared with the test sample\u2019s combination of early baseline, twin mid lobes and end rise. So moderate match.\\n  - label_6 (F-15): score 4 (high). Rationale: The test sample aligns very closely with the label_6 summary bullet points: early high start then descent into an early trough (t\u224813\u201326), mid twin peaks around t\u224865 & ~78 with concentrated low-frequency SHAP in exactly the same bottom-frequency bands, steeper mid-to-late descent producing some mid-frequency energy (penalized) and finally a pronounced terminal rise (t\u2248125\u2013143). The retrieved similar training examples (samples 19, 22, 11, 56 labeled 6) show almost identical time-series shape, STFT low-frequency patterns and SHAP bottom-row attribution blocks; this reaffirms the strong match.\\n\\nStep 4 \u2014 Cross-check with reference samples & final decision:\\n- Visual & STFT cross-check: The four provided 'similar' training samples (labels 19/22/11/56) are all labeled 6 and are nearly visually identical in: (a) large positive start, (b) early trough around t\u224820, (c) mid twin humps near t\u224855\u201380, (d) late trough ~100 and (e) final strong rise to a large endpoint. Their STFTs also concentrate energy in the bottom rows during the same windows. Their SHAP maps show bottom-row red blocks aligning with the same mid windows, consistent with the test sample. This strongly validates that the classifier learned a label-6 template and is applying it to the test sample.\\n- Dissimilar examples (labels 4 shown) exhibit a dominant single huge mid hump (peak amplitude much higher mid-sequence) and different SHAP distribution; they differ noticeably from the test sample.\\n- Fairness & scoring sanity: Because many classes in this dataset are distinguished mainly by the timing/relative amplitude/asymmetry of low-frequency lobes rather than by high-frequency texture, some moderate scores (3) across several labels reflect shared low-frequency morphology. However the combination of early big baseline + trough near t\u224820, mid twin humps concentrated around \u224865\u201391, and the large terminal rise is specifically enumerated in the label_6 summary and matched by the similar reference samples \u2014 hence label_6 is the best match.\\n\\nFinal classification: label 6 (F-15). Final reported similarity score for the selected label (label_6) is 4 (high similarity). Per-label similarity summary used in my internal check (1\u20134): [label_0:3, label_1:3, label_2:3, label_3:3, label_4:2, label_5:3, label_6:4].\"\n  ]\n}",
      "{\n  \"result\": [\"label 6\"],\n  \"score\": [4],\n  \"rationale\": [\n    \"Task 1 \u2014 fine-grained, local feature description (from SHAP red regions \u2192 corresponding plot/STFT): The SHAP heatmap shows concentrated positive attribution in the lowest-frequency rows spanning roughly time steps ~13 through ~104 (strongest around ~39\u201391). Using those time windows on the time series: (a) Early window (t \u2248 0\u201325, weak-to-moderate low-freq attribution starting ~13): the series begins very high (~+2.8\u2026+2.9 at t=0) and falls smoothly and monotonically to a deep trough (~\u22121.2 to \u22121.4) by t\u224815\u201325. This is a large-amplitude, low-frequency downward ramp (average slope \u2248 \u22120.18 to \u22120.22 units/step across the descent) with low volatility inside the trough (no high-frequency jitter). The STFT shows this event concentrated in the bottom frequency bins confirming a slow component. (b) Mid block (t \u2248 36\u201380, where SHAP is strongly positive at low frequency): there are a pair of broad positive lobes/peaks: a rise from a negative valley up to ~+0.6\u2013+0.8 (around t\u224855\u201366), a modest dip, then a second similar positive pulse around t\u224875\u201390 (again ~+0.6\u2013+0.8). Each hump is broad (width on the order of 10\u201325 steps), relatively smooth (low volatility inside the hump), and asymmetric substructure appears (rises are somewhat steeper than falls or vice versa in short segments). STFT energy for these mid events is concentrated almost entirely at the lowest frequency rows, matching the SHAP attribution. (c) Mid-late transitional window (t \u2248 78\u2013104): following the mid pulses there is a descent into another trough around t\u224892\u2013100 (~\u22121.2 to \u22121.5). The descent includes somewhat faster local change (slightly more mid-frequency energy in STFT) \u2014 these sharper transitions are visible in STFT as some increased mid-frequency content and are lightly penalized (neutral/weak in SHAP beyond the dominant low-frequency band). (d) Late window (t \u2248 120\u2013143): a large final low-frequency rise from a trough (~\u22121.3 at ~120) to the final high endpoint (~+2.8\u2013+2.9 at t=143). STFT again concentrates energy at the lowest frequencies and SHAP gives this region modest positive attribution. In short: the red SHAP band corresponds to several slow, large-amplitude, low-frequency events \u2014 an early large drop, two mid slow positive lobes, a mid-late trough, and a strong final rise \u2014 each broad and low-volatility (except some sharper transitional slopes producing small mid-frequency energy).\",\n    \"Task 2 \u2014 overall time-series characterization and temporal dependence: The sample is dominated by a persistent low-frequency envelope (quasi-periodic broad lobes) over the whole 144 points: large positive endpoints, deep early and mid troughs, and repeated broad positive humps in the middle. Volatility is heterogeneous: the broad lobes and troughs are smooth and low-volatility, while transitions between lobes (notably the descent into the trough near t\u224892\u2013100) contain relatively faster change and some mid-frequency content. The STFT confirms the signal energy concentrates in the very-low-frequency rows during the major events; mid-frequency energy is minor and localized to sharper transitions. Temporally, the sequence shows a consistent ordering: high start \u2192 deep early fall \u2192 mid pair of broad positive lobes (separated by troughs) \u2192 mid-late trough \u2192 final broad rise. The SHAP attribution aligns with this ordering: the model assigns positive weight to the broad, low-frequency bulges/tips (especially mid pulses and final rise) and tends to downweight sharper mid-frequency transitions. This implies the classifier leverages the timing, amplitude and ordering of broad contour features (not short spikes) to decide the label.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 matching to provided label feature summaries (initial selection): I compared the extracted features against each label summary: (label 6) F-15 summary emphasizes a strong very-low-frequency envelope across the mid region, an early positive offset and decline, twin broad mid peaks near t\u224865 and 78, a trough around t\u2248100 and a final large rise to a high endpoint \u2014 this is a nearly exact match to the sample. Other labels: several (0,1,2,3,5) also rely on low-frequency lobes but differ in timing, amplitude asymmetry, and which lobes the model prizes (e.g., label 4 Harrier expects a very large mid hump around ~52\u201371 with amplitudes ~+2.6 which our sample does not show). Based on the textual patterns, label 6 is the best fit.\",\n    \"Step 3 \u2014 provisional similarity scores to each label (1\u20134): I assign similarity levels informed by how many characteristic signatures align (timing of lobes, amplitude scale, low-frequency dominance, presence of twin mid peaks and final rise): label_0 (Mirage): 3 (moderate overlap \u2014 low-frequency multi-lobe behavior but different emphasis/timing), label_1 (Eurofighter): 3 (shares mid-segment low-frequency cycle but not as close in shape/asymmetry), label_2 (F-14 wings closed): 2 (some low-frequency trough/peak pattern similarity but overall timing and repetition differ), label_3 (F-14 wings opened): 3 (similar large slow swings but differing specific lobes/ordering), label_4 (Harrier): 2 (Harrier expects a dominant single high mid hump of larger amplitude than present), label_5 (F-22): 3 (F-22 has mid low-frequency hump patterns but typically different amplitude/timing). label_6 (F-15): 4 (high similarity \u2014 the sample\u2019s exact combination of early fall, twin mid broad peaks near ~65\u201380, mid-late trough ~90\u2013100, and a strong final rise matches the F-15 description closely).\",\n    \"Step 4 \u2014 verification with reference samples: The four 'similar' reference samples provided (samples labelled 19, 22, 11, 56) are all label 6 and are visually and spectrally extremely close to test sample 104: they show the same initial high \u2192 early fall behavior, twin mid broad peaks near the same time window, mid-late trough, and large terminal rise; their STFTs also show concentrated low-frequency energy at the same time windows and their SHAP maps concentrate positive attribution in the bottom frequency rows around the same mid windows. The two 'dissimilar' references (label 4 samples 3 and 90) both show an alternate pattern with a single very large mid peak (much larger amplitude and different shape/asymmetry) and different SHAP emphasis; they do not match test sample 104. This cross-check confirms label 6 is the correct match and supports the higher similarity score assigned to label 6 while giving lower scores to label 4 and label 2. The relative scoring across labels is therefore consistent with both the provided label summaries and the reference examples.\",\n    \"Final decision (after comprehensive verification): label 6 (F-15) with similarity score 4 because the sample\u2019s low-frequency envelope, exact timing of twin mid peaks, mid-late trough and large terminal rise all align closely with the F-15/label_6 description and the provided label-6 reference samples.\"\n  ]\n}"
